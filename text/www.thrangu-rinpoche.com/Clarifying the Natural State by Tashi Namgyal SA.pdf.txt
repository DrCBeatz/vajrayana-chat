THRANGU TASHI CHOEUNG, P.O.IIOX 1287,110UDDHA, KATHMANDU, NEPAL. PHONE: 4700ZI 
These days many people follow the Dharma astutely and 
not merely out of faith. Knowledgeable in many topics, 
they exert themselves in applying the sublime teachings. 
So, it is important that the profound and ultimate 
instructions of Mahamudra and Dzogchen are made avail­
able. These should include the sublime teachings of 
Mahamudra, the profound instructions that are simple to 
practice that are the unimpaired essence of realization of 
the eight great masters and eighty mahasiddhas from the 
noble land of India . .fu these instructions have been kept 
alive, through an unbroken stream of teaching and prac­
tice, by the learned and accomplished masters of Tibet, I 
find it of vital importance to have some of them translated 
into foreign languages. 
In particular, the words of Dakpo Tashi Namgyal are 
unique in that they are adorned with plenty of pithy advice 
out of his personal experience. Therefore, practitioners are 
greatly benefited by his instructions on how to remove 
hindrances and progress further. His methods for prac­
ticing Mahamudra, found in such books as Moonbeams 
and Clarifying the Natural State, are preeminent. Of these, 
this book is indispensable as it focuses exclusively on prac­
tice. 
Moreover, it is vital for the translator of such works to 
be not only skilled in language, but also possess some 
9 
degree of meditation experience. The lotsawa Erik Perna 
Kunsang was the attendant of and translated for T ulku 
Urgyen Rinpoche for many years and is experienced in 
meditation, I am therefore sincerely grateful that he has 
completed this English translation.

on February 4th 2001.

Respectful homage to glorious Vajradhara. 
Out of the unconstructed nature, the emptiness of 
dharmadhatu, 
Appear the magical sceneries of the worlds and beings, 
profound and brilliant. 
To their indivisible identity of empty bliss, spontaneously 
present from the beginning, 
To the all-pervasive original mind, I respectfully bow 
down. 
The true realization of mind, the all-pervasive identity of 
the definitive secret, 
Is difficult to realize through other long-lasting paths; 
Yet, you reveal it effortlessly, like pointing to it 
with your finger -
To the illustrious Gampopa and the masters of the 
Practice Lineage, I bow down.

His practice tradition known as Mahamudra, 
Celebrated like the sun and the moon, has illuminated 
this Land of Snow. 
Even so, here I shall set intellectual arguments aside and

Adorned with the pith instructions of personal experience.

This manual for guidance in the Mahamudra of the 
definitive meaning is meant for worthy people who are 
utterly weary of all of samsara' s miseries, who possess the 
intense renunciation of wishing to quickly attain enlight­
enment, and who have trust and confidence in the realized 
masters and the path of blessings. To establish them 
straightforwardly in the meaning of the natural state, 
there are four parts: 
Preliminary steps o/ guidance 
T1ze main part o/ the meditation stages 
Subsequent ways to continue the training 
11ze way to traverse the paths and bhumis through

This has two steps: 
General preliminaries 
Speci/ic preliminaries 
& explained elsewhere, practitioners should thoroughly 
train in the gradual stages of the path for the three types 
of individuaP This includes the reflections on the diffi­
cult-to-acquire freedoms and riches, impermanence and so 
forth. In this way, it is essential to develop a firm attitude 
of renunciation. 
If students do not do so keenly, but instead regard these 
topics as trivial, they will, after hearing the four mind­
changings a few times, leave them behind as mere infor­
mation. Having done so, they will not exert themselves in 
practice and become caught up in the eight worldly con-
cerns. 
Second, practitioners should be brought to maturation 
either by receiving the ripening empowerment within the 
Anuttara mandalas of the Secret Mantra or through the 
symbolic empowerment of blessings.

Following that, as explained elsewhere, to ward off lazi­
ness reflect on impermanence; to dispel obstacles take 
refuge and form the bodhisattva resolve; to gather the ac­
cumulations offer mandalas; to purify obscurations do the 
meditation and recitation of V ajrasattva; and to receive 
blessings train in guru yoga. Receive guidance in all of 
these points one after another and exert yourself in each 
of them for a suitable number of days, such as five or 
seven. At the end of each of these practices, gain some 
experience by relaxing your mind and remaining free and 
easy for as long as you can.

supplications that samadhi may take birth.

clarifying the natural state 
After that, place your legs in the vajra posture, or if you 
cannot, then in the sattva posture. Join your hands four 
fingers below the navel in the gesture of equanimity. Align 
your backbone and straighten your entire body; extend 
your shoulders and elbows until they too are straight. 
Slightly tilt your neck.2 Connect the tip of your tongue to 
the palate and close your lips with a slight space between 
the teeth. Your eyes should assume a peaceful gaze di­
rected at the level of your nose tip. In this way, sit in the 
sevenfold posture of V airochana. 
Generally speaking, body posture is important in all 
meditation practice. Specifically, the physical key points 
are essential for quieting the mind. This is why, when it is 
emphasized, some people find calm simply through this 
posture and also why it would be excellent to train for sev­
eral days in simply keeping the body posture. 
Then, during the daytime, place a support, such as a 
pebble or a stick that isn't too bright, directly in line with 
your gaze. In a relaxed way, direct your attention at it 
without fixating on it or examining it. Allow your atten­
tion to remain on the object of support simply to avoid 
wandering off or being distracted. 
Next, keep the attention, as above, on a small object 
that has been placed on the borderline between shade and 
sunlight. At night, focus the attention on a pea-sized 
white sphere between the eyebrows. At times, direct the 
mind, as before, on a pea-sized black sphere below you. 
A certain type of person will find it hard to gain calm­
ness and will grow tired of these ways of focusing the

attention. They should imagine the bodily form of the T a­
thagata, the size of one inch, right in the sky before them. 
Although a variety of other such ways of concentrating the 
attention are taught, for most people this will suffice. 
Once you have achieved a natural sense of calm, inter­
rupt the practice and take a short break. Do short sessions 
but repeated many times. 
In between sessions avoid entertainment, strenuous ac­
tivities and much talk. Keep both body and mind quiet.

avoid drifting off toward other things. Begin by focusing 
on three rounds of breathing, then on seven and so forth

take a little rest from time to time and then continue the 
training so as to gain some experience. 
Next, to center the attention by holding the breath, ex­

the two nostrils. Together with swallowing the saliva, press 
down the stomach with some force, but not too hard. For 
as long as you can, simply keep from wandering off; do

to hold, exhale gently through the nose. While exhaling 
and inhaling as before, keep attentive of the breathing at 
least enough so as not to wander off to other things. 
When tired, inhale and exhale freely through the nose. 
Keep your attention relaxed and clear, with enough mind­
fulness so as not to become distracted by anything else. 
Every once in a while take a rest. Continue training in 
this way until you gain some experience. 
If your attention becomes more agitated while doing 
this, it is due to being too focused, so relax from within. 
If you become repeatedly bored and very restless, it is 
due to being tired out, so refresh yourself for a couple of 
days. 
If you get dizzy and light-headed, it is due to the influ­
ence of wind, so take more nutritious food and drink, and 
do massage.3 
The steps up to this point are known as capturing the 
uncaught mind. They are necessary to achieve mental 
calm. 
If, during these steps, you feel that mental movements 
have increased and you are less calm, this is because of 
formerly not noticing all the thought-trains being pro­
jected. Now, you do notice one thought arising after the 
other. You have become aware and gained some calm, so 
do not regard this as a shortcoming. Do not direct the 
thought and do not pursue it. Rather, rest loosely and 
continue to apply yourself. By doing so you will experience 
calm.

clarifying the natural state 
If your attention is scattered, unresolved and you have 
no sense of calm, exclaim the forceful sound of PHAT or 
make a vigorous shout. Right then, the previous thought 
is interrupted and the next has not yet arisen. The atten­
tion in this gap is a thoughtfree state of calm. 
Next, understand clearly that notions such as "this 
needs to be done to that" are thought projections. Using 
various methods, skillfully proceed by alternating between 
being focused and relaxed. Be self-confident. Persevere in 
the training, since by doing so you will discover the state 
of calm. 
Shamatha wit"ho~t 13r~athiHS Practk~ 
When you have achieved some degree of mental calm by 
the previous method, assume the same body posture as 
before. Do not place your attention on external visual ob­
jects, sounds or the like, nor on the inward and outward 
movement of the breath. Do not think about the past, 
what you did or what happened previously. Do not think 
about the future, what you will do or what will happen 
later. Also do not create thoughts about the present, about 
what appears or what is happening right now. Rather, 
allow yourself to remain relaxed and clear, lucid and at 
ease. While remaining that way, interrupt the practice. 
Then continue again as before. Do not maintain this too 
long at a time; instead repeat it many times. 
In all instances of pursuing a state of calm, doing so 
with too much concentration and intensity may create a

hindrance for remaining lucidly attentive. For the most 
part, it is more suitable simply to relax. 
When placing your attention in this manner, if you be­
come agitated or scattered, sit in a warmer place, take 
more nutritious food and drink, do massage and lower 
your gaze. Focus your attention below the navel and sup­
press the breath in the belly with some force. 
If your mind feels dull and sluggish, sit in a cooler 
place, splash water on your face, expel the stale breath and 
lift your gaze. Invigorate your attention with sharp alert­
ness. If you still feel drowsy, refresh yourself by moving 
about. 
If you feel obscured and stupid, bow down before sacred 
objects and walk around them. Make offerings and give 
alms, apologize for misdeeds, and so forth with deep-felt 
sincerity. Make yearning prayers that samadhi may arise 
within you. Then continue the practice. 
These steps are known as stabilizing the captured mind. 
Unless you become trained so that your acquired calm can 
easily settle free from support and reference point, you will 
not find any enhancement in the practice without attrib­
utes. Training is therefore essential. 
It is an error to let your sense of calm become absent­
minded or numb, so be on the alert and continue by re­
peated short periods. 
If you feel sluggish or dull, with just the barest presence 
of mind, you must energetically purge this shortcoming, 
so train exclusively in purifying that for a while. Alter-

nately, you can train while generating a slight sharpness of 
attention. Use whichever method feels more suitable. 
Shamatha withol4t Attribl4tcs 
This has two points: 
Tightening 
Loosening 
TishtcMiM5 
Keep the same posture as before but raise your gaze a 
little higher and aim it at the level directly before you. 
Sharpen your attention and focus so as not to be dis­
tracted for even a second. Remain one-pointedly clear and 
lucid without the reference point of something particular 
to be cultivated by meditating. 
After a while, break up (the meditation); keep it short. 
Again scrupulously focus yourself. Remain with a sense of 
precision that does not wander off for even an instant. 
Train like this and gain some personal experience. 
By doing so, rather than the previous dull type of calm, 
your mind brightens up and becomes clear and lucid. You 
have gained progress when your mindful presence is lucidly 
clear. 
Some people of the quick-witted type may find that they 
do brighten up, but the periods of being calm become 
shorter. Do not regard that as a fault. Continue training 
in short periods many times, and by doing so both the 
calm and the lucidity will expand.

clarifying the natural state 
toos~l1il1S 
Take the same posture and keep the same gaze as above. 
Do not entertain any ambitions about what should or 
should not be cultivated by meditating. Do not be happy 
when calm or unhappy when thoughts move; rather, relax 
your attention loosely. Do not inhibit one thing while 
promoting another. Do not make adjustments. Leave your 
attention as it naturally is -relaxed and free. From 
within this state, maintain a presence of mind that is sim­
ply not distracted. Do not fidget; be expansive and clear. 
Train in being open and vividly present. 
While training in this way, when an obtrusive thought 
intrudes, you need neither begin to block it nor pursue it. 
Rather, maintain a steady and unwavering presence of 
mind. 
Nor do you need to block off or encourage the subtle 
fluttering of thoughts. Remain clear, lucid and quiet. 
Then interrupt to take a short break. Once again, con­
tinue training as before to see what experience you gain. 
Formerly, you had to focus one-pointedly by fashioning 
your conscious mind into being clear and open, while al­
most repressing coarse and subtle thoughts. This was 
somewhat uneasy (to sustain). So now, instead, it is 
enough to sustain the natural way of simply being undis­
tracted. 
When thoughts do occur, be they coarse or subtle, em­
brace them with mindful presence. By doing so, thoughts 
are unable to function as thoughts. They completely sub­
side and you arrive in a state of calm.

clarifying the natural state 
Once you have embraced a thought with this presence 
of mind, you need not keep any other aim, so you get a 
sense of feeling very free. During this type of release and 
relaxation, you appreciate the vital point of remaining in a 
free and easy state of mind. You have gained progress once 
this has become simple to sustain. 
However, if you get distracted while lost in the 
undercurrent of thought or carried away mindlessly with­
out noticing what you are thinking of, then your presence 
of mind is too weak. 
If your calm feels restless, unsettled or fidgety, your 
sense of looseness is inadequate or you are too intensely 
mindful. Clear up these shortcomings and continue the 
training. 
If the attention feels dull, develop a more vigorous 
mindful presence. If agitated, slightly lessen its strength to 
deepen the relaxed quality. By continuing in this way, 
your attention will remain utterly lucid. 
Shamatha has taken birth when perceptions of sights, 
sounds and so forth are experienced as vivid and serene, 
lucid and unbound. So, even if one of the various medi­
tation-moods do occur, do not get caught up in it. In­
stead, train for a while in the state that is both lucid and 
thoughtfree. 
Unless you get a firm footing in this, your meditation 
training will become sporadic. Gain a steadfast foothold.

clarifying the natural state 
At the beginning, you gain a slight degree of thought­
free calm amidst the turbulence of the many gross and 
subtle thoughts. This is the first stage of shamatha, simi­
lar to a mountain stream rolling through a gorge. 
Next, the thinking, for the most part, vanishes; so that 
your shamatha state remains serenely blissful. However, 
whenever a strong movement of thought occurs you are 
unable to keep it down. From time to time you get in­
volved in being scattered and agitated. This is the inter­
mediate stage of shamatha, similar to the placid flow of a 
river. 
Then, both coarse and subtle thoughts no longer arise. 
As long as you compose yourself in this thoughtfree state, 
you can remain serenely blissful. Even if a remnant of a 
subtle thought arises, it is unable to function as an actual 
thought; rather, it naturally dissolves into a state of nont­
hought. This is the ultimate stage of shamatha, like the 
mother ocean meeting its river child. 
Even though this type of shamatha does not suffice as 
the real substance of Mahamudra training, it is extremely 
important to have it as the basis for the training. Since it 
is mental stability that creates boundless virtuous karma, 
you should accomplish a flawless and steady state of sha­
matha.

For the first point, assume the same body posture as be­
fore. In addition, gaze straight ahead without blinking or 
shifting. Keep your attention vividly present in the 
thoughtfree and lucid state of shamatha. During this 
state, look directly into this attentive mind to see what 
shape, color, etc. it has. In which location does it remain 
and what supports it? What kind of definable identity and 
appearance does it have? Gradually examine and investi­
gate these points. 
In other words, does it have a shape that is round, 
square or the like? Does ,it have a shape like the earth, 
rocks, mountains, scrubs, trees or the like? Does it have a 
shape that looks like a human being, an animal or what? 
Does it have a color such as white or black, etc.? Examine 
each instance until you reach a definite conclusion. 
In the same way, examine whether the mind lives in ex­
ternal things of the world or beings, or in your body of 
karmic ripening. If it does live in this body, does it remain 
in a particular location or part of the body, from the 
crown of the head to the soles of your feet, or does it re­
main in a pervasive way? If it remains in a pervasive way,

clarifying the natural state 
does it dwell in a way that has an inside and an outside, or 
does it remain in a way that is diffuse? If diffuse, examine 
how your mind moves and so forth when becoming occu­
pied by outer objects and things. 
Likewise, is your mind an entity that can be identified 
as empty or as aware ?4 Regarding the empty quality, does 
that mean being empty like nothingness or empty like 
space? Is the lucidly aware quality radiant like the light of 
the sun and moon, or like the flame of a butter lamp? 
Examine what this lucidity is like. Investigate this until it 
is settled with complete and conclusive certainty. 
If you hold on to hearsay and theory and neglect 
investigating, you will not feel it is conclusively decided. 
So examine this to the very depth. 
If an incorrect understanding is held, counter-argu­
ments should be applied and the investigation continued. 
'§>-
It is easy to resolve that (this conscious mind) does not 
consist of any shape, color, location, support or material 
substance. However, if you take it to be a definable entity 
that is aware and empty and you remain quietly in that 
state, you are still unresolved, since that is the meditative 
mood of stillness. Therefore, make mandala offerings, 
supplicate with deep devotion and investigate each in­
stance of how it is aware, how it is empty and what its real 
mode is. 
Through this you may find that mind is not comprised 
of a concrete or material substance and therefore has no 
shape or color, no dwelling place or support. You may also

clarifying the natural state 
understand that it is an aware emptiness that defies any 
description of being such-and-such -it is inexpressible 
and yet it can be experienced. 
When that is the case, the lama should try to present 
confusing statements. If the meditator's understanding is 
merely theory or hearsay . it will be inconsistent and will 
not withstand scrutiny. If it is personal experience, it will 
converge on one point even when he is unable to articulate 
with traditional words. When this happens, the meditator 
has reached personal experience. 
Even so, there are eloquent and articulate meditators 
who lack personal experience. There are also experienced 
and tongue-tied meditators who are unable to explain. The 
lama should therefore let them thoroughly investigate and 
resolve this fully through real experience. 
While in the previous state of lucid and thoughtfree 
shamatha, as before, look directly into your conscious 
mind. It is a wakefulness for which no words suffice. It is 
not a definable entity, 5 but at the same time, it is a self­
knowing aware emptiness that is clear, lucid and awake. 
Sustain this without distraction.

clarifying the natural state 
location and support, its identity and appearance, and so 
forth. In the same way, let a subtle thought state arise or 
project one, and then look into and examine its identity. 
Similarly, let arise or produce a variety of subtle and 
coarse perceptions- of the world and its beings, enemies 
and friends, joys and sorrows, and so forth. Look into the 
identity of each. Scrutinize and examine it. 
Before, when you looked, perhaps you did so by general­
izing the lack of definable entity, or you didn't examine 
and failed to gain a precise experience. If so, you have only 
gained the theory that subtle and coarse thoughts and 
perceptions are unidentifiable. You will therefore not have 
found the ongoing and steady experience of liberation 
which is to be able to recognize directly their identity upon 
encountering them or to let their falsehood collapse. 
Therefore, don the armor of fortitude and continue ex­
amining until you have settled this point decisively. 
By doing this, a profound certainty will be attained, 
whether one is of a higher or lower acumen. This topic 
should therefore not be left vague or as a general idea. 
~ 
Next, in order to continue to gain personal experience, 
examine a particular thought or perception. You may now 
say, "It does not have any shape, color or definable iden­
tity. The identity of mind is simply an aware emptiness!" 
Or you may deliver some other piece of theoretical under­
standing. 
However, it isn't certain what you mean by aware empti­
ness. Do you mean an aware emptiness that happens after

clarifying the natural state 
a thought event has ceased or dissolved? Or is it an aware 
emptiness while the thought is present? In the latter case, 
you may say the state is aware, but it is meaningless to say 
it is empty. Scrutinize in this way and continue examin­
ing. 
No matter what kind of thought occurs, its experience 
is, in itself, something unidentifiable -it is unobstruct­
edly aware and yet not conceptualizing. As for perceptions, 
they are a mere impression of unobstructed presence, 
which is insubstantial and not a clinging to a solid reality. 
They are hard to describe as being such-and-such, and 
when you understand them to be this way you have 
reached personal experience. 
Without getting distracted then, simply sustain this 
aware emptiness that is an unidentifiable awareness, also 
referred to as a perceiving emptiness that is perception 
devoid of a self-nature. 
Someone may say, "When I look directly into a thought 
or perception, it dissolves and becomes an aware 
emptiness." This is a case of not having established cer­
tainty about the nature of thoughts and perceptions, but 
rather of using the idea of aware emptiness as an antidote 
against them.

Resolvi115 That Thoushts Are MiHb 
Assume the same posture as before. Let your mind be 
evenly composed as aware emptiness. From within this 
state project a vivid thought, such as anger. Look directly 
into it and thoroughly investigate from what kind of sub­
stance or basis it arose. 
Perhaps you suppose that it arose from this state of 
empty and aware mind itself. If so, examine whether it is 
like a child born from its mother or like light shining from 
the sun. Or is it the mind that becomes the thought? 
Next, observe the way in which it remains. When it ap­
pears in the form of anger, examine whether this anger is 
accompanied by the fetter of intense clinging to things as 
being real or whether it is simply an appearance of anger, 
an openness in which there is no identity to take hold of. 
Finally, observe how a thought departs. Is the thought 
stopped or does it dissolve? If it is stopped, who stopped it 
or what circumstance made it stop? If it dissolves, exam­
ine whether it dissolves due to some circumstance or 
whether it dissolves by itself. 
In the same way, a variety of gross and subtle thoughts 
should be examined to gain some experience. If the 
meditator holds a wrong understanding, it should be elimi­
nated with a counter-argument and a hint given. After 
that, the meditator should once more continue examining.

clarifying the natural state 
You may not have found that the thought arose from a 
particular location in a particular way, that it dwells in a 
particular shape or form or that it departs to a particular 
place. Nevertheless, your concepts about whether thought 
and mind are different, whether they are related as inside 
and outside, or as the body and its limbs and so forth 
must be destroyed. You must experience that the various 
thoughts, in whatever form they arise, are an empty ap­
pearance and not a definable entity. You must recognize 
that they arise out of yourself and dissolve into yourself. 
Since mind is unconfined, you must become certain that 
it is mind that merely appears or is seen as being thoughts. 
You must resolve that thoughts and mind are indivisible. 
Take the metaphor of a wave on water. The wave is 
nothing other than the water, and yet it is seen as a wave. 
Although it appears as a wave, it has never changed from 
being of the nature of water. In the same way, with the 
various types of thoughts, from the very moment they 
appear, they are nothing other than the aware emptiness 
of unidentifiable mind. 
Moreover, since this mind is unconfined, it does appear 
as a variety of thoughts. Even though it appears as them, 
it has not changed from being the aware emptiness of the 
mind that is not a definable entity. You must settle this 
point decisively. You must gain the experience of certainty 
in the fact that the various types of thoughts are mind. 
Similarly, give rise to a happy or a sad thought and in­
vestigate whether there is any difference in their identity.

Assume the physical posture as before and from within 
the state of aware and empty mind allow the appearance of 
any visual form to be vividly experienced. Investigate its 
arrival, remaining and departure, as above. 
Now investigate the following points. Is the visual per­
ception different from or identical to mind? If different, 
are they across from each other, one inside the other or 
one above the other? If that is the case, do they exist as 
separate entities that can stand alone? 
Or is it merely an instance of the mind seen as a visual 
perception? In the case of it being only the mind that ap­
pears as such, there is nothing more than a single mind, 
and that contradicts them being different. 
If the visual perception is identical with mind, are they 
identical in that it is mind that turns into the visual per­
ception, or are they identical in that it is the visual per­
ception that becomes mind? Investigate in this way to 
gain personal experience. If there is an incorrect under­
standing, it should be counteracted and a hint given. 
In this way, no matter what visual perception you see, 
you must become certain that it is merely the mind's per­
ceiving quality. No matter which of the various types of 
visual forms you see, you must personally experience that 
it has no definable identity but is a perceived emptiness. 
Since mind's expressive power is unconfined, you must

recognize that it merely appears as visual form and so 
forth. Do not keep visual perception and mind separate as 
outside and inside; settle decisively that perceptions and 
mind are indivisible. 
Just like the example and meaning explained above, or 
like the various visual forms that may appear external to 
be in a dream, although they are nothing other than the 
dreaming mind, so the dream-forms and the dreaming 
mind are indivisible. 
The myriad different types of things that are presently 
experienced, due to the incidence of objects appearing by 
the power of 'shared karma', are like the example of a clear 
mirror that is only perceived to be blue when meeting with 
the circumstance of a blue object and so forth. In fact, the 
mirror has not turned into anything other than its identity 
of being a clear mirror. 
Likewise, as long as this unconfined mind has not been 
purified of karma, it appears in various ways when meeting 
with the circumstances of different types of objects. In 
fact, the mind has not turned into anything other than 
mind itself. Having resolved this, you must gain the ex­
perience of certainty in the fact that the various types of 
perceptions are mind. 
In a simJar fashion to that above, investigate the oppos­
ing perceptions of beautiful and ugly things. As ex­
emplified by visual forms, also examine sounds, odors, fla­
vors and textures, and make sure you gain certainty.

hwestisati»s tl1e Calm a»~ tl1e Movi»s mi»~ 
Maintain the same physical posture as mentioned be­
fore. Let your mind be serenely calm in the state of aware 
emptiness. Now, investigate by looking directly into it. 
While in this state of serene calm allow a thought to 
vividly stir. Investigate it too by looking directly into it. 
Next, investigate the two instances of calm and thought 
movement to see if there is any difference in their arrival, 
remaining and departure or in their definable identity. 
If there is a difference between remaining calmly and an 
abrupt movement of thought, examine to see if their dif­
ference consists in being better or worse, empty or not 
empty, having or not having an identity, and between be­
ing or not being identifiable. 
If there is no difference, investigate to see if their lack 
of disparity consists in being identical or in being similar 
while different. 
If identical, investigate how they are identical at the be­
ginning, middle and end. If similar, examine how they are 
similar. Investigate in this way to gain some experience. 
In case an incorrect understanding is held, it should be 
stopped with a counter-argument, a hint should be given 
and the investigation resumed. 
Turning away from the belief that these two -serene 
calm and abrupt thought movement -are of entirely 
different substances, you must experience that they are the 
same mind, the mind that is identical in being rootless 
and intangible, and in being an aware emptiness that is 
self-l<nowing and naturally pure.

clarifying the natural state 
This being so, whichever of the two happens, there is no 
need to accept or reject, repress or encourage. Rather, you 
should become confident that this aware emptiness is 
naturally free -in the very stillness when calm and in the 
very arising when thoughts oc~ur. 
R~solvi115 That All £xp~riettc~ ls Nottarisitts 
While in the state of empty and aware mind, as before, 
the various types of thoughts and perceptions are the un­
confined expressions of this very mind itself. Now, ques­
tion this, "What is the natural state of this very mind?" 
Look directly and thoroughly investigate what caused it to 
arrive, how it remains and how it finally departs. 
In case an incorrect understanding is held, it should be 
terminated with a counter-argument, a hint should be 
given and once more the investigation should be contin­
ued. 
At the beginning, this mind was not produced from any 
causes or conditions, and did not arise from any basis, not 
in any way whatsoeverj rather it is rootless since the be­
ginning. Presently, it does not remain as any shape or 
form at all, but is unidentifiable. In the end, without 
being stopped by anyone, it is self-dissolving, self-clearing 
and self-liberated. 
You must experience the actual mode of this mind: a 
self-knowing emptiness that from the very first cannot be 
pinpointed as arising, dwelling or ceasing. And, having 
done so, you must resolve that this mind, however it may 
presently appear, cannot be improved by anything good or

worsened by anything bad. & this is so, resolve that it is a 
self-Clearing, self-knowing, self-liberated state that does 
not need to be fine-tuned or corrected. 
When examining and observing in the meditation pos­
ture and within the composure of empty and aware mind, 
all these types of vipashyana investigations and considera­
tions are experienced by means of vipashyana insight. On 
the other hand, if the examinations are made with an at­
titude of conceptual labeling, it is possible to gain a gen­
eral idea, but not bring forth real experience. 
Unless the meditators have resolved this with certainty, 
it is too early to receive the pointing-out instruction, since 
they will fail to trust it and pursue something else. Or, 
even if they practice with tenacity, they will linger in ordi­
nary states of shamatha. Clinging to the meditative moods 
and states of shamatha will not effectively bring them to 
enlightenment even though they may strive for many 
years. 
It is said that the person of the highest acumen must at­
tain realization, the middling gain experience, and the 
lesser type must reach a stable understanding. It is, how­
ever, not enough to merely understand. 
There are those who are good at explaining but lack per­
sonal experience and those who have the experience but 
cannot explain. The lama must, therefore, skillfully guide 
by counter-arguments and hints, and ask clever questions 
while pulling the wool over their eyes. 6 
Even when a sound experience has taken place, it is my 
opinion that the pointing-out instruction should definitely

should gain more experience. 
<i>o 
It appears that there are some who alternate guidance in 
vipashyana with the pointing-out instruction and some 
who employ investigations during the pointing-out in­
struction. Although there are a variety of such ways, in 
these contexts the best is simply to use investigation to 
resolve and bring forth personal experience. Thus, at the 
time of the pointing-out instruction the lama can point 
out what the experience is and launch the meditator upon 
training in it. 
If, however, some personal experience is plainly not es­
tablished, the meditator should, for a while, train in bring­
ing forth the awake quality within the state of shamatha. 
This will, at a certain point, be achieved through proper 
guidance, after which a stable experience will take place.

First, when giving the pointing-out instruction, no one 
else should be present besides the master and disciple. If 
you prefer, assume the posture as before. Then the master 
says: 
"Let your mind be as it naturally is without trying to 
correct it. Now, isn't it true that all your thoughts, both 
subtle and gross, subside in themselves? Rest evenly and 
look to see if this mind doesn't remain calm in its own 
natural state." 
The master lets the disciple look. 
"That's called shamatha."

"During this state, do not become dull, absent-minded 
or apathetic. Is it not true that you cannot verbally formu­
late that the identity of this mind is such-and-such, nor 
can you mentally form a thought of it? Rather, isn't it a 
totally unidentifiable, aware, unconfined and lucid wake­
fulness that knows itself by itself? 
"Within the state of evenness, look to see whether it 
isn't an experience without any 'thing' experienced." 
The master then lets the disciple look. 
"That's called vipashyana."

"Here, these two are mentioned sequentially, but in 
actuality this kind of shamatha and vipashyana are not 
separate. Rather, look to see if this shamatha isn't the vi­
pashyana that is an unidentifiable, self-knowing, natural 
awareness. Also look to see if this vipashyana isn't the 
shamatha of abiding in the natural state untainted by 
conceptual attributes. Rest evenly and look!" 
The master lets the disciple look. 
"That's called the unity of shamatha and vipashyana."

"Both are contained within your present mind. Experi­

and lead to." 
V)o 
Having said this, if the master prefers, he can inspire 
further confidence by giving relevant quotations from the 
scriptures. Otherwise, it may not be necessary to say more 
than the following, since some people of lesser intelligence 
may get confused when the explanation is too long. 
"The meaning in a nutshell is this: allow your mind to 
be as it naturally is, and let thoughts dissolve in them­
selves. This is your innate mind, which is an unidentifi­
able, self-knowing, natural awareness. Remain one-point­
edly in its continuity and do not get distracted. 
"During the daily activities between breaks as well, try to 
keep this kind of mindfulness undistractedly as much as 
you can. 
"It is important to continue training persistently for a 
couple of days. Otherwise, there may be a danger of this 
seeing of mind-essence, which you have pursued through 
various means, slipping away." 
The meditator should therefore train m focusing on 
that for a couple of days.

Second, the meditator should now assume the correct 
posture in front of (the master, and be told the following): 
"Let your mind remain in its natural way. When 
thoughts have subsided, your mind is an intangible, aware 
emptiness. Be undistracted and look directly into the 
identity of this naked state! 
"At this moment, allow a feisty thought, such as de­
light, to take form. The very moment it vividly occurs, 
look directly into its identity from within the state of 
aware emptiness. 
"Now, is this thought the intangible and naked state of 
aware emptiness? Or is it absolutely no different from the 
identity of innate mind-essence itself? Look!" 
Let the meditator look for a short while. 
The meditator may say, "It is the aware emptiness. 
There seems to be no difference." If so, ask: 
"Is it an aware emptiness after the thought has dis­
solved? Or, is it an aware emptiness by driving away the 
thought by meditation? Or, is the vividness of the thought 
itself an aware emptiness?" 
If the meditator says it is like one of the first two cases, 
he has not cleared up the former uncertainties and should 
therefore be set to resolve this for a few days. 
On the other hand, if he personally experiences it to be 
like the latter case, he has seen the identity of thought and

clarifying the natural state 
can therefore be given the following pointing-out m­
struction: 
"When you look into a thought's identity, without hav­
ing to dissolve the thought and without having to force it 
out by meditation, the vividness of the thought is itself the 
indescribable and naked state of aware emptiness. We call 
this seeing the natural /ace o/ innate thought or thought 
dawns as dharmakaya. 
"Previously, when you determined the thought's identity 
and when you investigated the calm and the moving mind, 
you found that there was nothing other than this 
intangible single mind that is a self-knowing, natural 
awareness. It is just like the analogy of water and waves. 
"This being so, is there any difference between calm and 
movement? 
"Is there any difference between thinking and not think­
ing? 
"Is it better to be serenely calm? Do you need to be 
elated about it? 
''Is it worse when a thought abruptly arises? Do you 
need to be unhappy about it? 
"Unless you perceive this hidden deception, you will suf­
fer the meditation /amine.7 So, from now on, when a 
thought does not arise you need not deliberately make one 
arise so as to train in the state of its arising, and when the 
thought does arise you need not deliberately prevent it, so 
as to train in the state of its nonarising. Thus, do not be 
biased toward calm or movement."

The principle for this thought can be applied to all 
thoughts. However, the meditator should train for a while 
in simply making use of thoughts, so when no thoughts 
arise, conjure one up on purpose and sustain its essence. 
Otherwise, there is a danger of losing sight of the identity 
of thoughts. 
The meditator should, therefore, be instructed to con­
tinue practicing diligently for several days. If it is prefer­
able, bring in some quotations to instill certainty.

Third, the physical posture and so forth should be kept 
just as before. Then ask: 
"While in the composure of the natural state, allow a 
visual perception, such as that of a mountain or a house, 
to be vividly experienced. When looking directly at the 
experience, is this perception itself an intangible aware 
emptiness? Or, is it the aware and empty nature of mind? 
Look for a while to see what the difference between them . " lS. 
Let the meditator look. He may say, "There is no differ­
ence. It is an intangible, aware emptiness." If so, then ask: 
"Is it an aware emptiness after the perceived image has 
disappeared? Or, is the image an aware emptiness by 
means of cultivating the aware emptiness? Or, is the per­
ceived image itself an aware emptiness?"

clarifying the natural state 
If the answer comes that it is one of the first two cases, 
the meditator has not thoroughly investigated the above 
and should therefore once more be sent to meditate and 
resolve this. 
If he does experience that the vividly perceived visual 
image itself -unidentifiable in any way other than as a 
mere presence of unconfined perception -is an aware 
emptiness, the master should then give this pointing-out 
instruction: 
"When you vividly perceive a mountain or a house, no 
matter how this perception appears, it does not need to 
disappear or be stopped. Rather, while this perception is 
experienced, it is itself an intangible, empty awareness. 
This is called seeing the identity of perception. 
"Previously you cleared up uncertainties when you 
looked into the identity of a perception and resolved th<lt 
perceptions are mind. Accordingly, the perception is not 
outside and the mind is not inside. It is merely, and 
nothing other than, this empty and aware mind that ap­
pears as a perception. It is exactly like the example of a 
dream-object and the dreaming mind. 
"From the very moment a perception occurs, it is a 
naturally freed and intangible perceiving emptiness. This 
perceiving yet intangible and naked state of empty per­
ception is called seeing the natural/ace of innate perception 
or perception dawning as dharmakaya. 
"This being so, 'empty' isn't something better and 'per­
ceiving' isn't something worse, and perceiving and being

clarifying the natural state 
empty are not separate entities. So, you can continue 
training in whatever is experienced. When perceiving, in 
order to deliberately train in perception, there is no need 
to arrest it. When empty, in order to deliberately train in 
emptiness, you do not need to produce it. 
"Whenever you recall the mindful presence of practice, 
all of appearance and existence is the Mahamudra of 
dharmakaya, without the need to adjust, accept or reject. 
And so, from now on, continue the training without being 
biased toward perception or emptiness by repressing or 
encouraging either of them. 
"Nevertheless, for a while allow various kinds of percep­
tions to take place. While perceiving it is essential to be 
undistracted from sustaining the unidentifiable essence." 
Thus, let the meditator train for several days. If it is 
preferred, bring in some quotations to instill certainty.

clarifying the natura/ state 
am not about to disprove others. I will, however, explain a 
little to encourage understanding in those who rely on me. 
Specifically, when people place exclusive emphasis on 
mental calm, their calm mind becomes like a lake frozen 
over with ice, so that all gross and subtle perceptions of 
the six senses cease. Or, even if not ceasing, they become 
unclear and hazy. Believing this to be the meditation 
state, the former incidence is a grave fault, while the latter 
is the shortcoming known as the inert state. 
There are also some who regard the meditation state as 
remaining in a mindless way that doesn't notice what is or 
what isn't. This is to be lost in oblivion with no idea about 
what's happening. 
Some people take meditation to be a vacant state of 
mind in which the former thought has ceased and the 
following thought has not yet arisen. 
These ways are not embraced by vipashyana and so are 
grave faults. Even when embracing such states with vipa­
shyana, these people feel they have to remain unmoved 
from this maintaining o/ Mahamudra. Thus, it becomes a 
meditation famine. 
Furthermore, some identify the meditation state as 
merely remaining in a state full of bliss. If so, they have 
not embraced it with vipashyana. Or, even if it is, they feel 
they have to block off all perceptual experiences. Even 
when not blocking, to regard perceptions as opponents is 
still not correct. 
If a state of being utterly empty, free from keeping any 
thought of the three times in mind, is regarded as the

clarifying the natural state 
:meditation state, that too is not embraced by vipashyana 
and has the grave fault of blocking off perceptual experi­
ence. Even when embraced, it is stJl not correct since 
there is a dislike for experience and perception. 
Or, if the meditation is regarded as constantly keeping 
the conceptual stance that all perceptions -whatever ap­
pears and is experienced -are insubstantial, this clinging 
to inconcreteness is a grave fault. 
Moreover, if the meditation is regarded as absent-mind­
edly refraining from accepting or rejecting the entirety of 
perceptual experience, that is indifferent calm and is simply 
an ordinary state. 
I do not see any of these stances as being the training in 
Mahamudra, but they do exist as various ways certain in­
dividuals create karma. 
Again, a state of mind that is lucid and thoughtfree may 
exclusively be regarded as the meditation. The lucid and 
indescribable awareness, after a thought has subsided, is 
indeed the meditation training. However, if you feel you 
must be thoughtfree, it is stJl imperfect. 
Similarly, when a thought stirs it is also imperfect to 
feel that you have to interrupt it and then remain lucid 
and thoughtfree. 
Both of these are cases of not yet having established 
thought movement and perception. 
Moreover, a wide-awake state of empty and aware mind 
after making yourself intensely mindful, may be regarded 
as the meditation. Even though this indeed is the medita­
tion practice, it is still imperfect in the sense of disliking a

clarifying the natural state 
natural, free and wide-open presence of mind and, instead, 
preferring to focus excessively in an unrelaxed way. 
It is, therefore, extremely important not to be confused 
about the flawed ways of meditation practice. 
The imperfect ways of training still have the possibility 
of progress, but they are awkward to sustain and so involve 
the risk of wearying of practice. Through various ways of 
focusing and relaxing in all instances -perceiving or 
being empty, thinking or being calm -you must thor­
oughly investigate and recognize, so as to find a comfort­
able way to sustain it. 
£xplaittiH5 flawless Me~itatiott Practice 
Second, meditation practice is known as undistracted 
ordinary mind. Ordinary mind simply means your mind's 
natural state. When you try to correct it by judging, ac­
cepting or rejecting, it will no longer be your ordinary 
mind. 
Therefore, undistractedly maintain the natural state of 
your mind with a naturally aware presence, no matter how 
it is or what is perceived or felt. That is simply called 
'meditating'.8 Other than that, there isn't even as much as 
a hair-tip to adjust mentally by meditating. 
It is explained in this way: "While there isn't even as 
much as an atom to cultivate by meditating, you shouldn't 
be distracted for even as long as an instant." Phrased in 
another way, undistracted ordinary mind means to keep the 
way your mind naturally is without being distracted.

clarifying the natural state 
This being so, as long as your naturally aware mindful 
presence has not wandered off, it is still the meditation 
training, whether your state of mind is utterly empty, re­
mains serenely blissful, whether thoughts flow in a rush or 
manifold perceptions appear vividly. Therefore, you do not 
need to entertain doubts about these expressions of the 
natural state. Rather than maintaining a sense of natural 
ease, there is no point in trying to arrest or block off the 
flow of thought or perception for the sake of remaining 
thoughtfree. 
The reason is this: just like before, when you cleared up 
uncertainties and during the pointing-out instruction, 
various entities such as mind-essence, thought, perceptual 
experience and so forth do not exist. Rather, they are the 
unconfined expressions of this single mind, just like the 
ocean itself is what is seen as waves. Therefore, this natu­
ral flow of mind does not differ in quality, no matter how 
it appears. 
This being so, you should sustain presence of mind in 
stillness when calm, in thinking when thoughts occur and 
in perceiving when perceptions take place. Do not deliber­
ately try to think when still or prevent a thought when it 
occurs. No maHer what your state may be -lucidly clear, 
totally empty, suffused with bliss or completely restless -
simply remain undistracted. You do not need to modify or 
correct anything. 
In short, everything is meditation training when you 
have naturally aware presence of mind and nothing is

clarifying the natural state 
meditation when you are distracted. Therefore, understand 
the great importance of maintaining this mindfulness. 
At some point, when mindfulness and your mind are no 
longer different entities, everything turns into the nature 
of mindful presence and it is 'smooth sailing' from then 
on.9 
You may now wonder, "Well, wouldn't it be enough 
simply to embrace whatever is experienced with mindful­
ness from the very first without having to follow gradual 
steps of guidance?" Yes, it might be enough for a few rare 
karmically destined people of the instantaneous type. For 
others, unless they follow the gradual steps of guidance to 
investigate and clear up uncertainties about perceptions 
and mind, they will not gain the certainty that accompa­
nies the experience of seeing their essence. One may have 
other types of mindfulness, but these will not suffice 
unless it is the naturally aware mindful presence. 
Consequently, the pivotal point here hinges on the 
words and meaning of ordinary mind and uncontrived natu­
ral mind. All the sutras, tantras and teachings of the 
siddhas of India and Tibet that express the true view lead 
to this point as well.

This has six points:

postmeditation

Enhancing by transcending into nonarising 
Developing strength through utilizing the conducts

It is not enough that the meditation practice has taken 
birth; you must sustain it perfectly. Unless you sustain it 
after the meditation has arisen, you will either remain an 
ordinary person or you will exert yourself in other kinds of 
conceptual practices for gathering and purifying.10 This 
would be straying from the true meaning, just as if the 
king would behave like his subjects or if a lion would join a 
pack of dogs. 
To deal with this, since revulsion is like the feet or the 
guardian of your meditation practice, you should contem­
plate the suffering of samsara. Keeping in your innermost 
mind that this life is impermanent and without lasting 
substance, cut worldly ties and resolve to equalize life and 
practice.

clarifying the natural state 
Since devotion is like the head or the enhancement of 
your meditation practice, entrust yourself fully and make 
sincere supplications to your guru and the Kagyii lineage 
roasters, never parting from seeing them as buddhas in 
person. 
Since mindfulness is the watchman or heart of your 
meditation practice, never forsake it, not only during ses­
sions, but also train in keeping constant company by re­
minding yourself of the natural state at all times and in all 
situations. 
Make compassion the activity of your meditation prac­
tice, so that you cultivate loving kindness, compassion and 
bodhichitta for all sentient beings and bring them under 
your protection with dedication and aspirations. 
Until you have reached perfection in your meditation 
training, keep to secluded places and regard as Mara's ob­
stacles the superficial acts of "benefiting others" by 
teaching and propagating the Dharma to them. 
Make modesty and conscience the armor of your 
meditation practice, so that inwardly you take your own 
mind as witness, while outwardly you do not create any 
causes for displeasing your precious teacher or Dharma 
friends. Exert yourself in meditation practice by staying in 
strict mountain retreat, sealing off your room, keeping 
silent and so forth.

From when you have taken hold o/ the meditation until 
the greater One-Pointedness, it is taught that you only 
have an ordinary type of meditation state and postmedita­
tion, not the authentic kind. Nevertheless, everything is 
meditation training if your naturally aware presence of 
mind does not wander while practicing. 
So, although you may be free from accepting and reject­
ing, until you succeed in intermingling the meditation and 
postmeditation of realization, you should make the 
meditation state the main part of your session and sustain 
your essence one-pointedly.11 During the breaks, focus on 
the postmeditation and make use of thoughts and 
perceptions. Understand this to be the intent of most of 
the Practice Lineages. This is also how it appears for most 
people, even though they may have given birth to the 
meditation; so this is how it should be taught. 12 
<§>o 
As for sustaining the essence, it is taught that you 
should remain in these three manners: fresh, artless and 
unbound. 
To be fresh, the key point of body is to relax deeply 
from within. The key point of speech is not to force your 
breathing. The key point of mind is to remain uncon­
cerned and without taking anything as support. 
To be artless, leave your mind as it naturally is, leave it 
without being a definable entity and remain undistracted.

clarifying the natural state 
To be unbound, remain free from accepting and reject­
ing, remain effortless and leave the six sense impressions 
in naturalness. 
In this way, nine essential points are listed. Phrased dif­
ferently, you should possess these three key points: 
Remain fresh in unconcerned naturalness. 
Remain artless and uncontrived without judging. 
Remain unbound and uninvolved in striving. 
'§>o 
Here are five analogies for this: 
Elevate your experience and remain wide-open like 
the sky. 
Expand your mindfulness and remain pervasive 
like the earth. 
Steady your attention and remain unshakable like 
a mountain. 
Brighten your awareness and remain shining like a 
flame. 
Clear your thoughtfree wakefulness and remain 
lucid like a crystal. 
Additionally, remain composed like in these three exam­
ples: 
Unobscured like a cloudless sky, remain in a lucid 
and intangable openness. 
Unmoving like the ocean free of waves, remain in

clarifying the natural state 
complete ease, undistracted by thought. 
Unchanging and brilliant like a flame undisturbed 
by the wind, remain utterly clear and bright. 
Here is how it is taught: First, suspend all effort to 
deeply relax body and mind. Next, let be in uncontrived 
freshness without indecision. Finally, maintain the prac­
tice after resolving that all perceptions are nonarising and 
naturally freed. 
To 'deeply relax the body' means simply to release the 
effort of excessively tightening or tensing the body, but 
not to cast away all the key points of physical posture. 
Naturalness, therefore, is the most important key point of 
body. 
To 'let be uncontrived and unbound' means simply to 
refrain from ambitious and goal-oriented judging, while 
not becoming apathetic or obscured by a hazy meditation­
mood. Therefore, maintain the naked state of a lucid 
presence of mind. 
To 'resolve that perce'ptions are nonarising' means sim­
ply that every perception dissolves -in the sense of being 
free from an identity that arises, remains or ceases -the 
very moment it is embraced by your naturally aware pres­
ence of mind. It does not mean to label it with the con­
cept 'nonarising self-liberation'. Therefore, train in not 
pinpointing anything.13 
If dullness and agitation make it unwieldy to keep your 
mind composed, adjust them with their respective key

clarifying the natura/ state 
points. For a while, train in being one-pointed, as firm as 
a stake driven into the ground. 
When you grow weary of this, keep a constant, naturally 
aware presence of mind during the breaks and during all 
instances of postmeditation, and maintain it undistract­
edly, no matter what thought or perception occurs. 
This is like the example of a competent herdsman tend­
ing to his cattle. They are allowed to roam freely. He does 
not have to keep bringing them together. It is enough to 
simply not lose sight of them. Similarly, no matter which 
thought or perception occurs, you do not need to block it 
or keep it under control. Rather, promote a naturally 
aware presence of mind and thus continue the practice 
with unbound ease without pinpointing whatever is experi­
enced. 
To explain further, during the four types of daily activi­
ties and so forth, continuously maintain an undistracted 
and lucid presence of mind. By doing so, even though 
distraction is compelling at first, a spontaneous presence 
of mind gradually expands, so that you experience nearly 
all thoughts and perceptions as a vivid state of aware 
emptiness. 
If this is downright hard to maintain, let a thought or 
perception unfold within the state of composure and look 
into its identity to settle it. Then continue in the manner 
above. 
When you persevere in this training during composure 
and postmeditation, there will come a point when every­
thing is embraced with the naturally aware presence of

clarifying the natural state 
mind. This is when thoughts and perceptions, no matter 
how they occur, are all experienced, the very moment they 
are thought or perceived, as an aware emptiness in which 
nothing can be pinpointed. 
These two -maintaining the essence one-pointedly 
during composure and tending thoughts and perceptions 
with mindfulness during postmeditation -are essentially 
no different. You will also have a variety of heavy and light 
meditation-moods of bliss, clarity and nonthought. 
If you keep company with these moods, they will ob­
scure the natural state. So, bring forth a sharp and alert 
mindful presence. Again and again, extricate your mind 
when immersed in the meditation-moods. Maintain the 
fresh and naked state.

Third, for people of little learning, who have only spent 
a short time following their master, there is a great risk of 
getting involved in sidetracks and strayings due to intel­
lectual understanding and meditative moods. 
Among the described four types of strayings concerning 
emptiness, the straying with regard to the nature of know­
abies has two aspects: 
Instead of recognizing the essential point of the training 
to be the indivisible unity of perception and emptiness 
endowed with the supreme of all aspects, the basic straying 
is to disregard good and evil by thinking it is an unreal

clarifying the natural state 
empty state in which faults and qualities are totally incon­
sequential. Although the meditator has understood the 
exact meaning of the essential training and is able to ex­
plain it, the temporary straying is to fail to bring it into 
personal experience. 
Straying with regard to the path has two aspects: 
Instead of recognizing that the training is the indivisible 
unity of path and fruition and that this fruition is present 
as a natural possession, the basic straying is to believe that 
the path is the training, while the fruition will be attained 
at another point. 
Although the meditator does possess the exact training, 
the temporary straying is to distrust it and seek it else­
where hoping for something superior or to meditate while 
adding something better. 
~ 
Straying with regard to the remedy has two aspects: 
Instead of recognizing the training as the indivisible 
unity of discard and remedy, and that by knowing your 
natural face the discard becomes its own remedy, the basic 
straying is to regard the emotion to be discarded and the 
training as separate and so to use the training as a remedy 
against the emotion. 
Whenever a thought moves or when encountering a 
difficult situation, the temporary straying is (to believe 
that) one can only be composed in meditation after the 
difficulty has been overcome.

Straying with regard to generalization has two aspects: 
Instead of recognizing that the training is the indivisible 
unity of means and knowledge and that all phenomena are 
the essence itself, the basic straying is to generalize with 
conceptual focus that they are devoid of self-nature. 
Rather than putting the training to use, the temporary 
straying is to generalize by wanting to recreate a past ex­
perience. Or, it could be to believe that meditation should 
interrupt thoughts: "I am dissatisfied with the present 
state. I must create a better one later!"14 
As illustrated, these are examples for strayings from the 
meditation training. Some types of straying can send you 
to the lower realms or tum you into an unfeeling person 
who never gained any thorough experience in practice. 
Therefore, it is essential not to stray. 
Sibctradu 
Generally speaking, while continuing the training you 
will encounter myriad different meditation-moods of bliss, 
clarity and nonthought. In particular, practitioners who 
have excellent channels, energies and essences, or devote 
themselves vigorously to the practice without being inter­
rupted by laziness and distractions, will have wondrous 
meditation experiences of a variety that defies description. 
Those who practice while intermingling their practice with 
other activities will only encounter tiny bits of such 
meditative states.

clarifying the natural state 
Regardless, the bliss experience can be of many different 
types. These include your body feeling permeated by bliss 
-even heat and cold feel pleasant; you do not notice 
whether or not you have a body; you feel so thrilled and 
joyful that you want to break out laughing; you are de­
lighted and overjoyed, free and easy; or you do not notice 
whether it is day or night. 
The clarity experience can be of various kinds. These in­
clude having a lucid state of mind, all perceptions be­
coming crystal-clear, seeing close and distant things even 
at night, seeing displays of luminosity, having the feeling 
of knowing other people's minds, and so forth. 
The experience of nonthought has a variety of types. 
These include seeing the various signs of 'empty forms', 
having the feeling that everything is empty, seeing per­
ceptions as insubstantial and devoid of self-nature, seeing 
oneself and perceptions as empty, feeling certain of emp­
tiness, and so forth. 
Whether it is one of these three meditative moods -
bliss, clarity and nonthought -in combination or a part 
of any of them, you might cling to these meditative ex­
periences as being paramount and train in a way that is 
fettered by them, by being happy when they come and un­
happy when they do not. If such is the case, bliss will 
cause rebirth in the Desire Realms, clarity in the Form 
Realms, and nonthought in the Formless Realms. 
Even if you are not clinging to these meditative moods, 
a meditation training that is fettered by them will make 
you generate the states of the shravakas and pratyeka-

buddhas, and you will attain nothing but a rest from the 
sufferings of the lower realms. It will hardly enable you to 
attain buddhahood, not even in the slightest. 
Furthermore, people whose intelligence is weak and who 
have received few teachings can misunderstand the train­
ing in the original essence. They will promote either an 
imperfect training, a dense type of calm, a hazy medita­
tion-mood, or detour into a distorted version of the natu­
ral state. 
Therefore, some sidetracks have the danger of leading to 
rebirth in the lower realms, while others can provide 
nothing more than a samsaric state of well-being. Like the 
example of walking to the west or north, when intending 
to go east, the aim is mistaken.

As for meditative experiences, there are three types 
which are connected to shamatha, vipashyana and the 
actual experience of realization. Among these three, the 
last is not regarded as a straying. The second, when the 
training is sustained with immediacy and free from cling­
ing, will bring progress after the meditative moods have 
naturally dissolved. 
Nevertheless, meditative experiences that involve trance­
like immersion are, for the most part, hindrances for 
making headway in spiritual practice and obscure the 
natural state. It will be most effective to train after de­
stroying these meditation-moods with various methods.

The time /or transcending 
Investigating thoughts and perceptions 
Investigating the meditation and the meditating mind 
The actual transcending into nonarising openness 
Mingling meditation and postmeditation, day and night 
The Time for Tratt6ceJ1bh15 
This is when the practitioner's dense meditation-moods 
of bliss, clarity and nonthought have dissolved. His mind 
has cleared up to such an extent that the meditation 
training in space-like aware emptiness has become con­
stant. Or, it is when the daytime experience for the most 
part has become constant. It is whenever a thought's 
movement is embraced by mindfulness, so it becomes a 
lucid aware emptiness, and whenever the perceptions of 
the six senses are embraced by mindfulness, they become 
vivid empty perceptions. When you thus find a decisive 
certainty within thoughts and perceptions it is the time for 
transcending. 
If the transcending takes place too soon, you will miss 
the real experience and instead become an insensitive in­
tellectual spouting forth the words of a "high view". If too 
late, even though there may be many fortunate people who 
dissolve their clinging to experiences and are liberated into 
steady realization, others may intensify their clinging to

During the preliminary practices in general and the 
guru yoga in particular, you should exert yourself in sup­
plicating with deep-felt and sincere devotion that all that 
appears and exists may dawn as dharmakaya. Sustain one­
pointedly the essential meditation method as explained 
earlier, and thus clarify your mind. Without getting dis­
tracted, remain wide-open and lucid. Within that state let 
various gross and subtle thoughts arise and, while looking 
into them without clinging, see whether there is any dif­
ference between the gross and subtle. See whether there is 
any difference between their identity and the identity of 
the calm state of mind. 
In the same way, look into the various types of thoughts 
such as joy and sorrow, as well as the thoughts of the three 
poisons. Create different types of thought activity so that 
you sometimes look while stopping them, sometimes while 
thinking even more, sometimes while chasing after them 
and so forth. 
Look into the various perceptions of extemal things, 
beautiful or ugly, pleasant or unpleasant. Let perceptions 
take place in varied ways through dissimilar physical.ex­
pressions, opening and closing your eyes, looking right 
and left, and see whether there is any difference between 
them.

Spend a few days looking into whether there is any 
difference between their identity and the identity of mind,

of thoughts and perceptions so as to develop certainty.

It isn't enough to just think that the essential medita­
tion training is an indescribable state beyond concepts, 
free of arising and ceasing. Within an undistracted and 
wide-open state of mind, look vividly and without fixating 
into the identity of the meditation state. Lool~ repeatedly 
to see how it is. 
Likewise, look repeatedly into the meditating mind and 
into the mind that clings to T and 'me'. 
Moreover, look to see whether there is any difference be­
tween the past, future or present mind. Look into where 
the past mind came from, where the future mind will 
come from, and how the present mind is. Spend a couple 
of days clearing up any uncertainty you may have about 
this and gain a decisive experience. 
The meditation object, the meditator and the mind 
states of past, present and future are not each of a differ­
ent nature. Rather, they are this very mind that can ap­
pear in any way while not having any concrete existence 
whatsoever. 
In its identity, mind is totally untainted by such precon­
ceived attributes as being definable, having a location to be

From the very beginning, it is groundless and rootless, has 
never been subject to confusion or liberation, and is 
neither polluted by faults nor improved by qualities. 
Recognize that it is self-existing, naturally pure, unique, 
wide-open and pervasive. Without fixating on this being 
so, train for a few days in a natural and free way to gain 
some decisive certainty. 
If the practitioner, however, is of weak intellectual 
power, then separate the inquiries mentioned above into 
the identity of thoughts, perceptions, the meditation, the 
meditator and the mind states of the three times. Have 
the practitioner look into them for quite a few days. It is 
essential to ensure that a decisive certainty is gained.

Now cast away all concerns about meditator and 
meditation object, experiencer and object of experience, 
the realizer and what is realized. Abandon all aims such as 
holding notions about whether or not "this is it" and the 
urge to meditate and be mindful. Without even the in­
tention "I should not keep anything in mind," simply al­
low your ordinary mind, plain and uncontrived, to be as it 
naturally is. 
No matter what kind of normal thought or perception 
habitually comes, do not try to mentally adjust or correct 
it; simply leave it to itself. Do not follow it up with

speculation. Do not regard an occasional wandering of 
your mind as a fault, and do not examine it. 
Whenever something is thought of, let go into simply 
being your ordinary uncontrived state without any type of 
object that has to be meditated upon, savored or acted 
upon. 
During the three activities of eating, lying down or mov­
ing about, do them within a state of being free from 
concepts, and refrain from any other activity. Apart from 
a small amount of torma offering and supplication, set 
aside all other types of spiritual practice and remain silent. 
When lying down, do so in an ordinary, uncontrived and 
open state. 
In this way, for a couple of days, cast all kinds of mental 
doing aside and remain as you naturally are, and thus gain 
some experience. 
At some point, the clinging to good dissolves, the 
confusion of negative thought wears out and you gain the 
definite assurance that everything is the very substance of 
the training. Ordinary mind- exactly as it is and during 
any type of experience -should then be pointed out as 
neither arising nor ceasing, neither to be accepted nor re­
jected, neither to be without nor achieved. It should be 
pointed out as being a self-existing natural purity, a self­
liberated openness that is neither distracted nor undis­
tracted, neither remembered nor forgotten, neither experi­
enced nor not experienced, neither realized nor unrealized. 
Everything is the substance of the training and everything 
is uninterrupted training. Be suspended like this for about

This type of uninterrupted training mingles the compo­
sure and the postmeditation. When there is an occasional 
distraction during the postmeditation, it is enough simply 
to recognize the natural state, whenever it is remembered, 
with the mindfulness of the ensuing understanding. 
Likewise, it is most eminent when the constancy of the 
daytime mingles into night to embrace both the sleep and 
dream states. If that is not the case and you become de­
luded, it is nevertheless sufficient to recognize the natural 
state immediately upon waking up. 
Remain like this for about five days without any other 
type of conceptual practice and without any mental doing 
whatsoever. 
After that, take rest for a few days in whichever way you 
please. Next, spend seven to ten days on transcendence, 
alternating it with rest. Thus transcend until your realiza­
tion of the natural state is uninterrupted throughout the 
day. Once it has become constant during the daytime it 
will gradually be experienced during the night. 
This way of transcending is also known as the instruc­
tion in constant training. It is the intent of the incompara­
ble Gampopa' s Revealing the Hidden15 to bring forth 
enhancement in establishing the naked, natural state. For 
this reason, if you follow this instruction precisely, m a

clarifying the natural state 
and enhance your practice when you engage in the various 
types of conduct and when you encounter the difficulties 
and worries mentioned above. 
Apart from this, there is no point in casting aside the 
king-like practice of utilizing all that appears and exists by 
sustaining the natural state free of conceptual attitude in 
order to train in another form of remedy-oriented prac­
tice. The time for utilizing is when your meditation and 
postmeditation have become steadfast. 
The types of conduct to utilize are the three types of 
elaborate, unelaborate and extremely unelaborate conduct 
belonging to the path of Secret Mantra -or, the ever­
excellent conduct, the secret conduct, the awareness con­
duct of yogic discipline, the group conduct, the conduct of 
complete victory and so forth. 
Many such types have been taught, but in this case, as a 
conduct for enhancing the meditation training, apply the 
ever-excellent conduct that is not in conflict with the mo­
nastic trainings. As well, in agreement with the unelabo­
rate, very unelaborate and the conduct of complete vic­
tory, go to such places as a mountain top, a haunted 
place, a charnel ground, under a large tree or at a cross­
road and make the kusulu offering and giving while 
avoiding conversation. 16 Also, make use of one of these 
five types: the wounded deer conduct of being uninvolved 
in the world, the lion-like conduct of being unafraid of 
whatever happens, the wind-like conduct of not being at­
tached to anything, the space-like conduct of not relying 
on anything whatsoever, or the madman conduct of being

these five types, utilize every difficult situation to enhance

Vtili:it15 Tholfshts 
When you begin to worry about various good and evil 
thoughts arising, recognize the thought and sustain un­
fabricated naturalness in whatever arises. This does not 
mean that you should concentrate in an attempt not to 
think the thought while using original wakefulness as its 
remedy. It also does not mean that you should try to ana­
lyze the thought's identity to establish its lack of a real 
nature. Nor does it mean that you should try to pursue 
the thought while maintaining mindfulness. 
What it means is this: recognize the thought's nature 
and simply make that the essence of your meditation 
training. No matter how it is, do not regard the thought 
as a fault. Do not deliberately try to suppress it. Do not 
get involved in it. Rather, without trying to change it, 
simply suspend it, in a way that is naked and clear, re­
laxed, spacious and free. 
In this way, the arising of any thought does not need to 
be confirmed or denied, accepted or rejected, adjusted or 
corrected, but vividly becomes the meditation training it­
self. This is known as utilizing thoughts. 
Because of not having mastered this principle, turbulent 
movements of thought seem at first frightfully prob­
lematic. Now, plunge straight into utilizing them. Gradu-

When you feel an emotion such as any of the five types 
-attachment, anger, dullness pride or envy -simply 
recognize it. Do not attempt to suppress it. Do not in­
dulge in it. Do not mentally try to alter it. Instead, sus­
pend the emotion itself, in a way that is lucidly present 
and with a spacious openness. 
From time to time try to create a more intense emotion 
by bringing to mind something even more provocative 
than the previous objects, such as the objects of attach­
m~nt or anger, whatever they may be -outer material 
things or sentient beings. Once the emotion is created, 
continue the practice as before. 
Concerning dullness, recognize the attitude of dozing 
off into sleep. When about to drop off, without trying to 
mentally alter it, sustain the state of simply being in that. 
This will become a way to let sleep dawn as luminosity. 
Continue as above until this is mastered.

clarifying the natural slate 
thought in a way that is clear, naked and awake. By doing 
so the thought is experienced as the meditation training. 
If the magical displays subside, imagine that an even 
more terrifying and mind-boggling magical display un­
folds. Increase the fear even further and continue the 
practice as before. 
When seeing, in general, that samsara is painful or, in 
particular, a sentient being who is suffering, rather than 
feeling compassion the Hinayana attitude is to be inspired 
to practice out of fear that oneself may suffer. The Maha­
yana attitude is to feel both loving kindness and love for 
that one being and, exemplified thereby, for all sentient 
beings. 
Whichever is the case,. utilize that particular attitude by 
recognizing it and, without trying to mentally alter it, 
suspend it in a lucid state of being awake. 
While not losing the continuity of that experience, 
generate loving kindness, compassion and bodhichitta for 
all sentient beings1 and make aspirations.

clarifying the natural state 
without trying to alter it, suspend it in being vividly pre­
sent. 
By continuing in this way, you find progress in that the 
pain becomes the meditation training without having to be 
rejected. If the sickness subsides, practice as mentioned 
above.17 
Moreover, investigate the ego-clinging within the one 
who feels sick, the one who hurts and the one who experi­
ences, and suspend it without artifice in the state that is 
free from any definable identity. 
Practitioners of Equal Taste, Ro-Nyom, may hold that 
one should now give up medical treatment. Here, in this 
context, it is more a matter of using your sickness for 
spiritual training, rather than foolishly assuming that it 
does not matter whether or not the physical support for 
attaining enlightenment dies.

In this way one should train by utilizing whatever hap­
pens and whatever circumstance is encountered. When the 
time of death arrives, no matter what takes place, includ­

forth, simply recognize them. Do not get involved in the 
worry of hope or fear, of suppressing or encouraging. In­
stead, sustain the practice in a lucid state of naked wake­
fulness, in exactly whatever it is that unfolds, without 
trying to correct it. 
At the end, after the dissolution stages have finished, it

These ways of utilizing are found in the various writings 
of the incomparable Gampopa. The main principle is 
contained in utilizing whatever happens in any situation as 
being Mahamudra and so equalizing its 'taste'. The 
masters of the Practice Lineage in the following ages, 
however, specified six ways of utilizing, and so we have 
these excellent trainings. Their aptness seems to vary for 
different types of people and should therefore be used ac­
cordingly. Under another name, they are known as Equal

The Varlo1-ts Walis Reali:atio11 ATises 
For the person of the instantaneous type, from the very 
onset of stillness, from One-Pointedness after being 
pointed out, from Simplicity or from One Taste, the pro­
gress up to Nonmeditation can take place at once, etc., 
and this progress is stable. 
For the person of the skipping-the-grades type, the next 
of the four yogas happens suddenly before the previous is 
stabilized, and this progress is unstable and will fluctuate 
considerably. If such a person remains continuously in 
retreat and trains one-pointedly, he will attain stability. If 
his period of practice during this life is but a short while, 
it is taught that he will have true realization in the bardo. 
For the person of the gradual type, the four yogas occur 
in a sequence in that the following happens gradually after 
the previous has been stabilized, and this occurrence is 
steadfast. So it essential to persevere. 
It is taught that when people of both the skipping-the­
grades type and the gradual type train in guru devotion 
and are resolute, they will have no great difficulty in being 
like the instantaneous type. 
There is a range of variables for how these yogas occur 
since each of the three types of people can be divided ac­
cording to their degree of mental aptitude. So it doesn't 
seem possible to systematize an exact description of the 
sequence of the four yo gas. Nevertheless, here I shall ex­
plain the clear-cut progressive order for the gradual type of 
person, since it includes both the spiritual practices as well

clarifying the natural state 
as the points to be accepted and rejected that pertain to 
the indefinite ways realization arises. 
For the yoga of One-Pointedness, there are three stages 
due to the difference in higher, medium and lesser degrees 
of proficiency. 
The lesser One-Pointedness is from the time when the 
samadhi of aware emptiness endowed with the bliss experi­
ence is somewhat difficult to maintain up to when the 
meditation state happens whenever you train. 
The medium One-Pointedness is when, from time to 
time, you arrive in samadhi even without practicing, and 
when practicing it becomes stable. 
The higher One-Pointedness is when you totally arrive 
in the state of aware emptiness- unceasingly during the 
meditation state and postmeditation, the four daily activi­
ties and throughout day and night. 
'§>-
Furthermore, there are these six distinctions as to 
whether or not perfection has been reached: 
You have seen the essence of One-Pointedness if you 
have reached a naturally knowing and confident certainty 
in your mind's aware emptiness. You have not seen the 
essence if you do not possess this confident certitude, even 
if you can remain in the states of bliss, clarity and non­
thought.

clarifying the natural state 
You have perfected the strength of One-Pointedness if 
this state of aware emptiness becomes constant through­
out day and night. You have not perfected its strength if it 
is an occasional resting. 
Your thoughts have become meditation if whatever 
thought or perception occurs, without having to be aban­
doned, turns into the meditation training simply by em­
bracing it with mindfulness. They have not become 
meditation if you need to meditate by withholding them. 
The qualities have arisen in you if you attain the signs 
such as turning away from the eight worldly concerns. 
They have not arisen if your mind isn't pliable. 
You have planted the seed of the form-bodies if during 
the ensuing certainty you feel compassion for sentient 
beings and make aspirations to benefit others. You have 
not planted them if it feels difficult to be compassionate. 
You will have attained mastery over the relative state if 
during the ensuing certainty, you feel sure of the unfailing 
details of causation. You have not attained it if you fail to 
gain certainty in the dependency of causation. 
At the time of lesser One-Pointedness, you have a defi­
nite meditative state of mind that is an aware emptiness 
endowed with bliss experience. When a thought or per­
ception occurs within that experience, it dissolves and is 
liberated by itself. You may perhaps have the intellectually 
fabricated certainty of thinking, "This is the meditation!"

clarifying the natural stale 
During the ensuing perceptions, you perceive them with 
a sense of delight, but for the most part they are a solid 
reality. 
During the ensuing certainty, whenever you embrace it 
with a mindful presence, you have an experience of aware 
emptiness, but it is accompanied by the attitude of 
thinking, "This is empty! This is a mental experience!" 
During the dream state, apart from a slightly higher de­
gree of lucidity, there isn't much difference. Some people 
have a greater number of dreams, but not very specific. 
Sometimes you find it hard to remain in composure 
and think, "My meditation is not succeeding!" There are 
considerable fluctuations, and you feel devotion, pure per­
ception and compassion. 
At the time of medium One-Pointedness, your training 
in aware emptiness accompanied by a feeling of bliss grows 
stable whenever you practice. Sometimes you arrive in it 
suddenly, even without practicing. 
Within that state of experience, fewer thoughts and per­
ceptions arise than before, and they are liberated by them­
selves. 
During the ensuing perceptions, they are accompanied 
by the experience of aware emptiness, and they feel open 
and free. Sometimes they are also felt as solid reality. 
During the ensuing certainty, you arrive totally in the 
meditation training whenever you remember. 
During the dream state, sometimes the meditation­
moods happen, sometimes not. For some people dreams 
grow less in number.

clarifYing the natural state 
You begin to take delight in your meditation training. 
At the time of greater One-Pointedness, the aware 
emptiness accompanied by the bliss experience becomes 
constant, and all your thoughts dissolve into that state. 
All ensuing perceptions take place within that. Dreams, 
for the most part, are also included within that state. 
You gain an assurance that retains a fondness for emi­
nence. You may also have various meditative moods of 
emptiness: that mind is a blissful emptiness, an empty 
knowing, that thoughts are an aware emptiness and that 
appearances are a perceived emptiness. Or you may have 
the experience that everything is like a dream and magical 
Jlusion. You may also manifest some conditioned virtues. 
You may begin to think, "There is no meditation state 
superior to this!" You also feel devotion and so forth. 
~ 
During these three stages of One-Pointedness, exert 
yourself in staying in mountain retreats, sealing off your 
room and keeping sJence. Beware of becoming defJed, 
and perform the rituals for cleansing defJement if you do 
come into contact with such defJements. 
When you feel dull or agitated, remove these faults and 
look into mind essence. When you feel obscured, apolo­
gize for misdeeds and request empowerment from your 
master. Receive the samadhi-empowerments repeatedly. 
Offer feasts, make offerings and give alms. Ask advice 
from your master and Dharma friends, and correct your 
practice.

clarifying the natural state 
If it happens that your shortcoming is so severe that you 
do not want to ask advice from your master or Dharma 
friends and you begin to foster wrong views, since this is 
an obstacle from Mara, you should take refuge. 
Continue your practice while bringing forth an even 
deeper weariness and renunciation, devotion, pure percep­
tion and compassion. For a few days take a rest, correct 
the shortcomings and then continue. Do any appropriate 
physical exercises. In this way, carry on one-pointedly ac­
cording to the way of sustaining samadhi explained above, 
with vigorous mindfulness or a tenacious mindful pres-
ence. 
Take care not to stray into intellectual analysis, 
thoughtless calm, savoring a meditative experience or 
hankering after the ensuing certainty. 
Do not cling fondly to nice experiences, while regarding 
unpleasant experiences as undesirable defects. Do not ac­
cept or reject, no matter what occurs, but train in being 
free from fixating and the attempt to correct. 
If the meditative mood is dense, disconnect yourself 
from it by sharpening your attention, and repeatedly train 
in fresh wakefulness. 
At times, read the life-stories about how the forefathers 
of the Practice Lineage maintained their meditation prac­
tice, their vajra songs and so forth, and by doing so de­
velop the fortitude to emulate them. 
Continuing your practice in this way, you experience 
and then realize that bliss, clarity and nonthought are in­
divisible as the empty and aware nature of mind. You re-

alize that thoughts are aware emptiness, that perceptions 
are perceived emptiness, and thus you resolve that every­
thing is mind. Realizing this mind to be a nonarising self­
knowing that is self-liberated, you have completed the 
realization of One-Pointedness. 
':i}<> 
If for some reason you do not progress at all, you should 
train in giving up the three types of clinging: 
Giving up the clinging to I. Cast away all concerns for 
this life. Be an outcast from human society. Sever worldly 
ties. Throw away attachment to friends and hostility to 
enemies. Offer your body to your guru. Abandon the 
cherishing of the physical aggregates. Mal~e the kusulu 
offering. 
Giving up the clinging to possessions. Make a pleasing 
offering to your master of all your wealth and belongings. 
Make pleasing torma and feast offerings to your yidam 
and so forth. Give pleasing presents to your vajra brothers 
and sisters. Give up hoping for happy times, good meals 
and nice things. Forgo food, clothing and good reputa­
tion. Keep to the above-mentioned conduct of a mountain 
deer and so forth, and forsake your homeland and other 
places that promote distraction, attachment and aggres­
sion. If for some reason you cannot forsake those places, 
then keep silent for a couple of years. 
Giving up the clinging to samadhi. Discard taking delight 
in, enjoying or trusting all "good" experiences. Transcend 
into the natural state by resolving that whatever occurs is

clarifying the natural state 
neither good nor bad. Maintain a wakefulness that is 
natural and naked, stripped of any meditative mood. 
By doing so, you gradually progress and, at some point, 
your meditation-moods dissolve. The dualistic fixating on 
subject and object falls apart. You realize that the essence 
of mind is free from the constructs of arising and ceasing. 
Thus, the realization of Simplicity dawns.18 
Simplidt\f aH~ lts £Ml1a11ceme11t 
Simplicity also has three stages. The lesser Simplicity is 
when you realize that the identity of the thinking and per­
ceiving mind is devoid of such constructs as arising and 
ceasing. However, you are not free from the fetter of sa­
voring the conviction that clings to it as being empty. You 
also still entertain hopes and fears concerning samsara and 
ntrvana. 
The medium Simplicity is when the fetter of savoring 
this conviction that clings to it as being empty has dis­
solved. But, you have hopes and fears during perceptions 
and have not cleared up uncertainties. 
The greater Simplicity is when you have dissolved the 
fixating on the conviction that all of samsara and nirvana 
-whatever appears and exists -is empty. You are free 
from hope and fear, and you have cleared up uncertainties.

These are the distinctions as to whether or not the per­

clarifying the natural state 
In order to see the essence of mind as being free from 
constructs -simplicity -your clinging to conviction 
must dissolve. You have seen the essence of Simplicity if 
you, after investigating thoroughly the nature of the ex­
periencer, totally arrive in a state in which all constructs 
have dissolved. You have not seen the essence if you have 
not dissolved the tarnish of conviction, which is the experi­
ence of clinging to emptiness. 
You have perfected the strength of Simplicity if you 
have cleared up uncertainties about ordinary mind as 
being devoid of constructs without even the slightest shred 
of clinging to emptiness, hope or fear. You have not per­
fected its strength if you entertain hope and fear during 
perceptions, even though you know their nature to be 
nonarising and you have not dissolved the clinging to 
emptiness. 
Your thoughts have become meditation if for all 
thoughts and perceptions you recognize that they are in­
stances of empty thinking and empty perceiving. During 
the ensuing perceptions, you have a realization that is like 
that of the meditation state. Your thoughts have not be­
come meditation if that does not happen. 
The qualities have arisen if by applying the key points of 
the path o/ means you connect the signs of accom­
plishment with realization. The qualities have not arisen if 
you do not manifest visible signs of accomplishment. 
You have planted the seed of the form-bodies if non­
conceptual compassion arises out of the unobstructed ex­
pression of emptiness and if the coincidence of resolve and

clarifying the natural state 
aspiration is formed during the ensuing certainty. You 
have not planted the seeds if it feels difficult to be com­
passionate and if the coincidence of skillful means is not 
formed. 
You have attained mastery over the relative state if 
emptiness dawns as cause and effect and if you understand 
that even though the essence is devoid of constructs it can 
be changed into anything whatsoever through circum­
stances. You have not attained mastery if without under­
standing the coincidence of cause and effect you belittle it 
while fixating on emptiness. 
At the time of lesser Simplicity, you realize that the 
identity of all phenomena is devoid of the constructs of 
arising, dwelling and ceasing. Nevertheless, you retain a 
slight fixation on everything being empty. When you fail 
to embrace the ensuing certainty with mindful presence, 
you· get involved in solid fixation on love and hate toward 
friend and enemy. As well, your states of deep sleep and 
dreaming, for the most part, are still deluded. 
There are considerable fluctuations in your spiritual 
practice, and it is possible that sometimes you have trust 
in your master, Dharma friends and practice, and that 
sometimes you feel doubt. 
At the time of medium Simplicity, the meditative tar­
nish of fixation on emptiness dissolves and you are totally 
free from clinging. Having investigated thoughts thor­
oughly, you may have cleared up uncertainties about 
thought-movement, but you still entertain some degree of 
rigidly clinging to hope and fear during perceptions.

clarifying the natural state 
During the ensuing certainty and dreams, you experi­
ence varieties of delusion and nondelusion. Toward your 
guru, Dharma friends and practice you also go through 
various types of ups and downs in terms of trust, doubt 
and so forth. Sometimes you even have the thoughts, "I 
wonder if there really is a buddhahood to be attained or a 
hell to be reborn in?" 
At the time of greater Simplicity, you have thoroughly 
investigated all the phenomena of samsara and nirvana, so 
you entertain neither hopes nor fears about anything. 
Having cleared up uncertainties, you are totally free from 
feeling at ease or not at ease concerning outer and inner 
phenomena being empty or not. All perceptions are ex­
perienced as empty and devoid of a self-entity. 
During the ensuing certainty all perceptions are not yet 
an exclusive state of transparent mind in which thoughts 
have dissolved. Your daytime meditation training is, how­
ever, steadfast as it is accompanied by the good meditative 
states of empty knowing and empty perceiving. 
Even so, since mindful presence has not yet become 
uninterrupted in the literal sense, you occasionally need to 
depend on a rigorous mindfulness. During dreams, you 
still have some degree of ordinary delusion. 
From time to time you may even think, "I wonder if 
there really is a buddhahood to attain or a hell realm to 
end up in! I wonder if this isn't the realization of the 
natural state!" 
You comprehend even the most profound teachings, ex­
perience mind essence as being your guru and perceptions

clinging to anything and turn away from the eight worldly 
concerns. Nevertheless, you are in danger of falling prey to 
conceit, arrogance, disparaging others and of thinking, 
"Now I don't need a teacher anymore!" 
':ff>o 
During these three stages of Simplicity, forsake the 
three types of clinging, keep to extremely secluded moun­
tain areas and exert yourself in keeping silence and staying 
in sealed-up retreat. 
Apart from torma offering and supplications to your 
guru, it is essential that, for some time, you set aside all 
types of practice with conceptual attributes while focusing 
on mindful presence and undistracted training. 
Sometimes create conditioned virtue by making offer­
ings and giving alms, training in devotion to your guru, 
pure appreciation of your Dharma friends, compassion for 
sentient beings and reflecting on the connection between 
cause and effect. Discuss the profound meaning of reali­
zation with your guru and Dharma friends, read the vajra 
songs of the siddha lineage, sing them as songs and so 
forth. 
For the most part, the important point is to keep un­
distracted from a continuous mindful presence. Often 
people do not like too much conceptual focus. 
Sometimes it happens that the blissful feeling is di­
minished and you want to move on, want to eat or feel 
unhappy and so forth. You should then make use of a

If you have no progress at the level of greater Simplic­
ity, even after practicing for years, you should forsake the 
three types of clinging, request empowerment, apologize 
for samaya breaches and so forth and pray to deepen your 
realization. 
Imagine the suffering of hell while visualizing yourself 
as your yidam. Resolve that it is mind, and compose your­
self in simplicity. Similarly, bring to mind the pleasure of 
the gods, the states of samsara, and the nature of nirvana, 
and compose yourself in simplicity. 
Sometimes, go to the top of a mountain and relax into 
the state of simplicity. Sometimes, go to a place where 
many people gather and relax into simplicity. Retain the 
winds for a session, look at appearances with wide-open 
eyes and relax into simplicity. It is said that by continuing 
in this way you will have progress. 
At some point after this, you will experience the pure 
and uncontaminated yoga of realizing all the phenomena 
of samsara and nirvana to be of One Taste, the Maha­
mudra of being free from accepting and rejecting them as 
with or without the conceptual constructs of arising and 
ceasing, empty or not empty and so forth. 
One Taste also has three stages. The lesser One Taste is 
when you have realized that all thoughts and perceptions

are of one taste in being the Mahamudra of mind essence. 
However, you still retain a bind: the conviction of savoring 
and clinging to that. 
The medium One Taste is when this tarnish has dis­
solved: the conviction of savoring and clinging to multi­
plicity as being one taste. You have actualized the resplen­
dent indivisibJity of perceptions and mind in which the 
perceived is not held as being outside and mind is not held 
as being inside. 
The greater One Taste is when you realize multiplicity 
as being of one taste and you experience one taste as being 
multiplicity. Thus, everything subsides into the original 
state of equality. 
~ 
Here are the distinctions as to whether or not perfection 
in One Taste has been reached: 
You have seen the essence of One Taste if, free from 
accepting or rejecting, confirming or denying anything 
perceived, you have recognized the original state of equal­
ity as an objectless natural awareness. You have not seen 
the essence if you stJl cling to the conviction that savors 
this equality in terms of something to be mingled and a 
mingling with it. 
You have perfected the strength of One Taste if what­
ever you encounter is experienced as the expression of this 
original state of equality. You have not perfected its 
strength if one taste isn't experienced as multiplicity be­
cause of retaining the bind of a remedy.

clarifying the natural state 
Your thoughts have become meditation if all dualistic 
clinging, including mind and the perceived, etc. has dis­
solved. Hence -free from the sense of being bound or 
released in the six types of impressions -it is all right to 
let whatever appears appear. They have not become 
meditation if you need to liberate the impressions with a 
reminder to recognize. 
The qualities have arisen if, after mingling mind and 
perceptions, you have attained miraculous powers, such as 
being able to conjure and multiply. The qualities have not 
arisen if the signs fail to appear due to the inducing cir­
cumstances of the path being feeble.19 
You have planted the seed of the form-bodies if all­
embracing compassion occurs effortlessly and the treasure­
mine of benefiting others has opened. You have not 
planted this if the power of means, such as compassion, is 
weak and if you do not accomplish the benefit of others. 
You will have attained mastery over the relative state if 
you have become skilled in causation. This means you can 
separate samsara and nirvana by experiencing the immedi­
acy of awareness because of clearly realizing the dependent 
connection between causes and effects. You have not at­
tained this mastery if you do not experience one taste as 
being the causation of multiplicity. 
At all times during the lesser One Taste, you have re­
alized the essence of the original state, but you still retain

During the ensuing certainty, you find difficulty in 
continuing your spiritual practices while encountering per­
ceptions disturbed by intense objects and circumstances, 
and you, to a minor degree, experience a solid fixation on 
duality. 
During the dream state, there is some slight confusion

Sometimes you have the experience that all three -
your body, perceptions and mind- are indivisible. How­
ever, it is possible that your regard for causation, your de­
votion and your compassion may dwindle.

subject and object of realization, the experiencer and the 
experienced, dissolve. The fixation on the duality of mind 
and perceptions is cut at its root. 
During the ensuing certainty and the dream state your 
confusion is even less than before, and you have no 
noticeable clinging to solid reality. 
At the time of greater One Taste, your realization of 
nonduality becomes constant throughout day and night, 
and it is free from clinging to the manifold unobstructed 
expressions of the original state of equality as being real. 
The experience of nonthought, as simply an aware 
quality that perceives yet does not judge, occurs with a 
slight savoring. 
During the ensuing certainty, you perceive with a subtle 
duality and appreciate appearances as being like a magical

Dreams free from clinging occur as unobstructed and

dreams at all. 
'§>-
During these three stages of One Taste, for the most 
part, keep to secluded places. From time to time, partici­
pate in group gatherings and you will progress. 
Even though you think that it makes no difference 
whether or not you meditate, it is essential to keep to se­
clusion and train in the true mindful presence. 
Even though you have attained the realization of greater 
One Taste, if you fail to have some degree of clairvoyance 
and receive signs from the dakinis, you must be tainted by 
damaged samayas. Therefore, make, for instance, a 
thousand tsa-tsas or the like, and offer a flower to each of 
them. Make the request, "May my defilement utterly 
subside!" Perform the dharani-ritual for purifying 
defilement, as well as any other suitable virtuous practice. 
If you get involved in pleasure or displeasure when signs 
occur, you are influenced by Mara. Consider that being 
benefited or harmed, assisted or hurt by Mara, and so 
forth, are all your own mind and that this mind is limit­
less and centerless, like space. 
Once the realization of One Taste has dawned within 
you, there is no fear of thought, no preference toward

clarifying the natural state 
qualities and you cannot be swayed by faults. On the other 
hand, Mara has taken possession of your mind if you 
become profoundly competitive and have plenty of 
disturbing emotions, obsessive thoughts and preferences. 
Recognize that and exert yourself in virtuous practices. In 
any case, understand the meaning of the saying, "Recog­
nize everything that counteracts your meditation training 
to be Mara." 
It is also possible to belittle the importance of methods 
by thinking, "There is no need for compassion and devo­
tion since sentient beings are my own mind and the guru 
is also my own mind." Instead, strengthen your compas­
sion and devotion. 
Be extremely careful to adopt virtue and avoid evil. Ar­
range all kinds of positive types of causation, avert all 
kinds of negative ones, and accept the armor of cause and 
effect. 
When there is benefit or harm happening to others, 
there is the danger of being caught by the Godly Son 
Mara, so cast away superficial deeds to benefit others. It is 
also essential to remain unattached to followers, posses­
sions and fame. 
By continuing the practice in this way, the tarnish of 
meditation-moods and savoring all subside, and the reali­
zation of the path and the natural state intermingle. Thus 
the realization of N onmeditation dawns beyond compo­
sure and postmeditation being embraced or not by mind­
fulness.

clarifying the natural state 
N onmeditation has three stages as well. The lesser 
N onmeditation is when all perceptions are experienced as 
meditation training. You do not have to remain mindful 
or deliberately compose yourself in the meditation state, 
and you retain only the slightest clinging to them as being 
like a magical illusion. 
Medium Nonmeditation is when you are even free from 
this clinging to the notion that they are magical illusions, 
so that throughout day and night you are in an uninter­
rupted state of nonmeditation. During the ensuing cer­
tainty, a subtle continuity of dualistic consciousness is 
experienced as natural awareness.20 
Greater N onmeditation is when even this subtle dualis­
tic consciousness transforms into original wakefulness, 
yes he. Everything is simply an overarching state of original 
wakefulness. 
":§» 
Here are the distinctions as to whether or not perfection 
in N onmeditation has been reached: 
You have seen the essence of N onmeditation if your re­
alization of nonmeditation is free from an object of 
remembering or familiarization so that the savoring has 
dissolved. You have not seen the essence if you retain a 
sense of something that needs to be remembered or grown 
accustomed to. 
You have perfected the strength of N onmeditation if 
the subtlest dualistic perception has dissolved and you have

brought all phenomena to the state of exhaustion, so you 
are always indivisible from original wakefulness. You have 
not perfected its strength if you experience even the 
slightest dualistic perception and you have not exhausted 
the phenomena of knowable objects. 
Your thoughts have become meditation if every instance 
of all-ground consciousness, without being rejected, has 
dissolved into being dharmadhatu wisdom. They have not 
become meditation if you retain a subtle type of propen­
sity for conceptual clinging and the subtle tarnish of 
savoring an experience. 
The qualities have arisen if your body appears as the 
wisdom rupakaya of the rainbow body and your mind as 
the luminous dharmakaya. Thus the world is experienced 
as all-encompassing purity. The qualities have not arisen if 
you retain even the slightest impure perception regarding 
body and mind, the world and beings. 
You have accomplished the activities of the form-bodies 
if you have reached perfection as the dharmakaya in which 
basic space and original wakefulness are indivisible, so that 
your inexhaustible adornment-wheel of Body, Speech and 
Mind spontaneously and ceaselessly fulfills the needs of 
sentient beings. You have not accomplished these activi­
ties if this has not happened and you still need to depend 
upon pure realms. You will have purified and attained 
mastery over the relative state if you have perfected all the 
qualities of buddhahood. You have not attained this purity 
and mastery if the three webs obscure the qualities of 
buddhahood: the body-web of karmic ripening, the per-

~ 
At the time of lesser N onmeditation, dualistic percep­
tion has mostly dissolved. Without having to deliberately 
meditate or deliberately remind yourself, all perceptions 
are experienced as the meditation training, so that you are 
unwavering from the meditation. 
During the ensuing perceptions, there is a remnant of 
ignorance called thoughtless nonrecognition, which is the 
all-ground consciousness remaining as a thoughtless state 
of indifference. This is also known as the defilement o/ 
negative tendencies. 
Although you do not create karma, it is taught that 
clinging, not yet dissolved into original wakefulness, still 
occurs like fugitive moments of magical illusion. During 
dreams you still encounter a slight clinging to them as 
being real due to not recognizing. 
At the time of medium N onmeditation, even this most 
subtle dualistic perception, which is like a magical illusion, 
dissolves and you become uninterrupted in the state of 
nonmeditation throughout day and night. 
During the ensuing perceptions, the extremely subtle 
trait of thoughtless nonrecognition dawns as a natural 
awareness. This is called perfection in accordance with the 
intrinsic nature. It is taught that this trait is the subtlest 
defilement of negative tendencies and that it is still pre­
sent at night.

clarifying the natural state 
At the time of greater Nonmeditation, this extremely 
subtle trait of thoughtless nonrecognition dissolves into 
original wakefulness so that the mother and chJd lumi­
nosities intermingle. Everything is now the all-encompass­
ing expanse of original wakefulness so that -for the 
benefit of yourself -you attain dharmakaya in complete­
ness. Since its natural expression is mastered, free from 
any partiality, it is taught that the reflections of the form­
bodies for the benefit of others will spontaneously fulfJl 
the welfare of beings for as long as samsara lasts. 
In this regard, the state of nonmeditation that is ex­
perienced during this lifetime is either the lesser or 
medium N onmeditation, transcending meditative compo­
sure and postmeditation. This is in the sense of attaining 
the profound certainty that is free from objects to be 
abandoned and free from a remedy to be applied, free from 
an object to be purified and free from the mind that 
purifies, and is beyond dying or not dying. It is difficult to 
reach higher than that. 
Generally speaking, a state of nonmeditation that is the 
mere absence of meditator, meditation object and the act 
of meditating also occurs during Simplicity. During One 
Taste there is also a state of nonmeditation that is merely 
to experience the freshness of thoughts and perceptions 
followed by a going beyond meditative composure and 
postmeditation. These are not the real state of N onmedi­
tation, but rather the meditation-mood of nonmeditation. 
For the real state of Nonmeditation, it is taught that

clarifying the natural state 
dawned as a natural awareness, it is essential to use the 
mindful presence of continuous wakefulness to sustain the 
flow of the ordinary mind that is neither contrived nor 
cultivated. 
Even though you do not create any more karma, no 
matter where you stay, no matter who you are with and no 
matter what you do, it is essential that as a meditator you 
maintain the inspiring exterior of a Dharma practitioner. · 
Therefore, keep to mountain retreats, raise the banner of 
practice, forsake incorrect behavior and deal appropriately 
with the relative principles of what should be adopted or 
avoided. 
~ 
Here I have described the ways in which the meditative 
composure and the postmeditation, the ensuing certainty, 
ensuing perceptions and dream states are experienced in 
terms of the gradual type of person. It is indeed taken as a 
given that he or she maintains the training one-pointedly 
in a secluded place. It does not follow all the various ways 
precisely, such as for instance those who eagerly hanker 
after mundane appearances during postmeditation. N ev­
ertheless, the identity of the realization may be experi­
enced exactly as it is. 
The ways in which the levels of experience and realiza­
tion of these twelve yogas occur are extremely difficult to 
fully comprehend for the lesser type of practitioner and are 
not within the domain of their intellectual scrutiny. Still, 
you should find trust by means of the teachings of Lord

As for more details, you should carry through with your 
practice, gain understanding from the inner master that is 
your own mind and from the outer master that is the 
teachings and instructions of the realized siddhas. Thus, 
bring yourself to the level of exhaustion o/ concepts and 
phenomena. 
There are people like me who, without being perfected 
through the karmic continuity of former training, are 
satisfied with a couple of years of practicing the Dharma 
of comfort. When afterwards they pretend to have reached 
full realization, they fool both themselves and others with 
superficial benefit. It seems more important to establish 
true understanding and be honest.

Generally speaking, there is the path of gradual training 
explained in the philosophical vehicles, which specifies 
manifest qualities, and the present meditation practice, 
the path of training instantaneously in the original state 
that ascertains your natural essence. These two are ulti­
mately alike while being temporarily dissimilar. Neverthe­
less, here is the description of the paths and bhumis and 
the way in which they are traversed. 
From the initial entering upon the path of blessings up 
to seeing the essence and perfecting the strength of the 
meditation of One-Pointedness corresponds to the dura­
tion of the level of a beginner and the path of accumula­
tion. 
Up to and including the three meditation stages of 
Simplicity corresponds to the duration of the level of de­
voted conduct and the path of joining. 
The three meditation stages of One Taste and the lesser 
and medium N onmeditation corresponds to the duration 
from the level of the first bhumi and the path of seeing, as 
well as to the path of cultivation from the second to the 
tenth bhumi. 
The greater Nonmeditation corresponds to the level of 
buddhahood and the path of consummation.

clarifying the natural state 
Presently, since you simply sustain the way of the natu­
ral state and do not practice the path explained in the 
causal vehicles, the signs of that path will therefore also 
not appear. However, it is held that all the manifest quali­
ties will appear simultaneously and spontaneously once 
you have perfected the strength of greater N onmeditation. 
Nevertheless, if you practice by mingling with the 
Secret Mantra path of means, it is explained that the suc­
cessive signs of the Mantra path do appear. 
There do exist several ways of combining in a detailed 
way the twelvefold meditation training of the three-times­
four yogas with the paths and bhumis of the philosophical 
vehicles, but it is complicated to organize them meticu­
lously. 
Thus, this major guidance text for the blessed Maha­
mudra path of definitive meaning should customarily be 
taught through personal experience. For those who have 
not gained such experience, I have made use of the pithy 
instructions of the forefathers of the Practice Lineage to 
explain this in a way that is simple to understand, without 
convoluting it with scholarly verbiage and structures. 
Afraid of overloading it with supportive quotations, I have 
refrained from doing so. You can find such details else­
where.22 
When it comes to bringing this into your personal ex­
perience, be kind to yourself by honestly applying a 
method of meditating that suits your individual capacity. 
By all means, it is essential to desist from taking what you 
understand of these words and insensitively spout high

clarifying the natura/ state 
views. Please avoid becoming a "Dharma expert" with no 
practical experience! 
The vajra speech of sublime accomplished masters 
Is distorted in the minds of the childish people 
of the dark age. 
The few profound guidance texts that clarify some parts 
Give no final support to how or when experiences arise. 
Apart from those who possess the strength of learning 
and former training, 
Only a few people can assemble the fragments 
of oral advice. 
My guidance text to clarify the stages of the path 
Is therefore the unexcelled offering from this yogi. 
For the root and lineage masters who uphold 
the Practice Lineage, 
May it be a mandala that bestows blessings 
and realization! 
For advanced meditators who have brought forth 
realization, 
May it be an offering that reminds and inspires trust. 
For seasoned meditators who nurture the seedlings 
of experience and realization, 
May it be a banquet of certainty that cuts through doubt.

clarifying the natural state 
For apprentice meditators, dJigent but clinging 
to experiences, 
May it be a bounty that dispels wrong views 
and faulty meditation. 
For idle Dharma people who only gather data 
without experience, 
May it be the legacy for attaining the natural state's 
qualities. 
For all the shortcomings of my ignorance and 
misunderstanding 
I apologize forever to all sublime beings. 
Through this virtue may all beings 
Swiftly perfect the realization of Mahamudra.

This text is based on requests from several of my medi­
tator disciples to write a decisive and reliable guidance 
manual on Mahamudra. The one from Gampo with the 
name Mangala (T ashi) composed it during the waxing part 
of the fourth lunar month in the Year of the Sheep at the 
retreat center of the great seat, the glorious Dakla Gampo, 
with the help of the scribe T ashi Dondrub. May it bring 
virtuous goodness to all beings. Sarvada mangalam. May 
it be virtuous!

It has been a profound privilege and joy to fulfill 
Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche' s wish that an English ver­
sion of this text be made available. With his oral teachings 
at two Namo Buddha Seminars and his additional clarifi­
cations as guidance, this first attempt was made by Erik 
Perna Kunsang and Michael Tweed at Nagi Gompa her­
mitage, Aprll2001. 
It was Rinpoche's wish to include the Tibetan script to 
facilitate further teaching and understanding. His student 
Christopher B. Barstow did the typing. Thanks to Khenpo 
Jigmey and Khenpo Perna Gyaltsen for proofreading the 
Tibetan, and also to my wife Marcia for checking the 
manuscript. Special credit is owed to Larry Mermelstein 
of the N alanda Translation Committee for his extensive 
review and suggestions. The endnotes, as well as 
imperfections and faults, are mine. 
May this bring countless beings in contact with their 
original nature. 
clarifying the natural state 
1 The gradual stages of the path for the three types of individu­
als are embodied in the jewel Ornament o/ Liberation. It is 
therefore advisable to have studied those teachings prior to 
this book. 
2 Tuck your chin in slightly. 
3 Wind (r/ung) here refers to imbalances of energy currents in 
the body. 
4 The Tibetan word for 'aware' here is gsa/ ba. It is often trans­
lated as luminous, cognizant, clear, lucid, wakeful, etc. 
5 In the following text, this principle of 'not being a definable 
entity' is also referred to as intangible, indescribable, not 
pinpointing or unidentifiable. 
6 Thrangu Rinpoche mentioned here that it is sometimes 
necessary that the instructor says the opposite of the truth to 
see if the student will 'take the bait'. This will expose intel­
lectual understanding. 
7 Thrangu Rinpoche mentioned that meditation famine means 
a weak and unsteady type of practice with no foundation for 
progress. 
8 The word for 'meditating' (sgom skyong ba) can also be trans­
lated as maintaining the practice or continuing the training. 
9 Phrased differently: "your meditation practice is simple and 
easy to maintain." 
10 Involvement in practices for gathering the accumulation of 
merit and purifying the obscuration of negative karma rather 
than training in Mahamudra is also known as losing the view 
in the conduct. 
11 In this context, essence is a synonym for the natural state.

clarifying the natural state 
12 Thrangu Rinpoche mentioned that the four yogas in this 
context are to be practiced with recognition of the nature of 
mind. 
13 Not pinpointing means to remain open, not identifying, 
labeling or fixating. 
/ 14 Literally, "This is not working! Something else is needed!" 
15 Revealing the Hidden is entitled Gabpa Ngonjung. 
16 The kusufu offering and giving refers to the Cho practice. 
17 Imagine being struck by an even more horrible disease. 
18 This is why Simplicity literally means absence o/ constructs. 
19 Among 'inducing circumstances' are compassion, devotion, 
perseverance and intelligence. 
20 'Dualistic' is inserted in front of consciousness (rnam shes) so 
as to distinguish it from original wakefulness (ye shes). 
21 Lord Gomtsul (rje sgom tshu0 is the nephew of Gampopa, 
also known as Tsultrim Nyingpo (tshul khrims snying po).

in Moonbeams o/ Mahamudra, (Mahamudra), Shambhala 
Publications, 1986.
