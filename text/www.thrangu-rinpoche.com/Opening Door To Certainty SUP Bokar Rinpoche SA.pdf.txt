Foreword 
Bokar Rinpoche was born in Western Tibet in 1940. Considered by his peers 
as one of the greatest meditation masters of our times, he has written a brief 
text for his disciples which we are presenting here as Opening the Door to 
Certainty. 
Short and compact, Opening the Door to Certainty is a condensed version 
of the Ninth Karmapa's work titled, The Ocean of Certainty. 
The Karmapas are as well known in Tibet as the Dalai Lamas. They have 
headed the Tibetan Buddhist Karma Kagyu lineage of reincarnate masters 
since the 12th century and are the direct successors of Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, 
and Milarepa. 
The Ninth Karmapa, Wangchuk Dorje (1556-1603) wrote several works 
on meditation, the most complete and renowned being The Ocean of Certainty 
(Ngedon Gyamtso). This voluminous book, of which to date there is no 
translation into any Western language, is a major classic of the Kagyupa 
School. It is generally used by the lamas to teach meditation. 
The term certainty (or absolute truth, absolute meaning, definitive 
meaning, true meaning), used in the title of the above mentioned texts 
designates direct understanding through experience of the absolute nature of 
the mind beyond the psyche and its fluctuations, beyond concepts and 
emotions, beyond birth and death, and beyond space and time. The term is 
also used in a parallel way with the "pedagogic meaning" (or pedagogic 
truth) which refers to the methods used in the psychological or conceptual 
domains to aid in the understanding of certainty. Certainty is thus linked 
with absolute truth and wisdom, whereas the pedagogic meaning is 
associated with relative truth and skillful means. 
Certainty is furthermore an equivalent term for Mahamudra, a Sanskrit 
word signifying "great seal" or "great symbol." Bokar Rinpoche introduces 
Mahamudra in the following way: 
The subject of our study is Mahamudra. Mahamudra is also the mind. We call 
the mind that which knows, feels, and produces suffering, happiness, thoughts, 
sensations, feelings, and so on. We will study this mind and work upon it. 
Do not think of Mahamudra as another reality, like something on a higher plane 
than ourselves. Mahamudra is not in the sky while we are on earth. Mahamudra is 
not elsewhere. We are never separated from Mahamudra, although we do not 
recognize it. 
The purpose of Mahamudra is not to bring us something new but to introduce 
us to that which we already have. Mahamudra meditation allows us to internally 
grow accustomed to what we have discovered within ourselves through practice 
following the instructions we have received; it enables us to continuously dwell 
within this awareness. 
The Tibetan word Chagya Chenpo, meaning Mahamudra, is defined as "the 
nature of the mind, clear light, and emptiness comprising all phenomena of samsara 
and nirvana." 
Bokar Rinpoche's text is so concise that its reading by a beginner risks 
leaving the reader with a feeling of confusion. In fact, Opening The Door to 
5 
Certainty is not intended to develop and clarify the meditation and approach 
to Mahamudra; rather it selVes as a reminder for those who are already 
engaged on the path. Written in verses, the text is easy to memorize and 
recite ritually. Bokar Rinpoche composed this work at the request of students. 
It is intended to help students easily recall the various aspects of the path, 
showing them the exact place of each point, and inviting them to progress 
and deepen their understanding. 
The French and English translations were made at the request and with 
the help of Bokar Rinpoche. They are mainly intended for the disciples who 
attend the meditation seminars that Bokar Rinpoche conducts regularly in 
India. These translations will also be of some interest to those who are 
engaged on the profound paths of Buddhism and study the Tibetan language. 
We have tried to remain as close as possible to the Tibetan text. As far 
as possible, we have selected literal terms for the translation of technical 
terms~ avoiding their interpretation. 
In spite of all efforts, there may be some mistakes in our translations. 
May those who detect any errors be thanked in advance for sending us their 
comments.

Translator's Note 
At the request of Bokar Rinpoche, I translated Opening the Door to Certainty 
from French into English. Although many people with more expertise than 
I, have assisted in this project, I, alone, am responsible for any errors. It is my 
sincere wish that despite its imperfection, this translation will carry the 
original meaning and make accessible these profound teachings to those who 
want to study and practice them. May the excellent activity of Bokar 
Rinpoche benefit all beings.

Text 
Om Soti. The lama, deities, and my own mind are inseparable in the 
natural state. At all times, prostrating, I place myself completely under 
their protection. 
With the mind of benefitting those who wish to follow the guide for integrating the 
"coemergent Mahamudra" that is The Ocean of Certainty, I have outlined the 
structure of the text. I have composed a short version epitomizing the meaning, 
which may be used as summary verses easing the approach of meditation stages or 
for combining recitation and meditation. It is divided into three parts: preliminaries, 
body of the practice, and post practice. 
Preliminaries 
I. COMMON PRELIMINARIES 
1. FREEDOMS & R!CHNESSES OF THE HUMAN EXISTENCE SO DIFFICULT TO 
OBTAIN 
Namo Guru Bay. Those who wish to practice the holy Dharma correctly 
must abandon distractions and first reflect upon this excellent support, 
endowed with the eight freedoms and the ten richnesses. So difficult to 
obtain and extremely beneficial, this support is comparable to a wish­
fulfilling jewel. Even more rare is the vajra-body with the six elements, 
by which it is possible to accomplish Awakening in a single lifetime 
through the practice of the Vajrayana. The difficulty in obtaining human 
existence is explained by causes, comparisons, and numbers. Even if we 
have obtained it, it is easily destroyed. This is why, from now on, we 
must devote all our efforts only to the practice of the Dharma. 
2. DEATH AND IMPERMANENCE 
All compound outer and inner phenomena, container and beings are not 
permanent even for the slightest instant, as is shown by the four ends. 
Particularly, the life of beings is like a flame exposed to the wind or like 
a bubble on the surface of the water. It is certain that I will die. Although 
the moment of death is uncertain, I will die very soon. The causes of 
death are many and even if I do not want it, I will die. No one has the 
power to ward off death. At the time of death, intolerable suffering is 
experienced. There is no other refuge but the holy Dharma. 
Consequently, without wasting time, we generate disenchantment. We 
feel a sense of urgency and ardently give ourselves up to virtue.

3. ACTION, CAUSE, AND EFFECT [KARMA] 
Once dead, we are like a lamp whose oil is exhausted. Wherever we are 
reborn, we cannot do it freely, but it is certain that we are led by karma 
and have no control of our own. It is commonly said that the various 
manifestations of happiness and suffering are the result of positive or 
negative acts. Accomplishing the ten positive acts leads to birth in 
fortunate realms while accomplishing the ten negative acts under the 
influence of conflicting emotions brings birth in unfortunate realms. We 
reflect thoroughly on this process. Briefly, the result of the ripening 
karma of our actions, without vanishing, will definitively be experienced 
by us alone. Therefore, we should meticulously examine the stream of 
our mind to correctly apply perfect discrimination between positive and 
negative acts. 
4. DEFECTIVE NATURE OF 5AMSARA 
Wherever we are born within the six cyclic realms of the three spheres, 
we are continuously tormented by the three types of suffering. There are 
the atrocious and long sufferings of the beings of hot and cold hells; 
hungry ghosts endure hunger and thirst, and animals devour each other. 
Human beings undergo the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, death, 
and much other suffering. Demi-gods suffer from quarreling, and gods 
from transmigration and downfall. We reflect on the ways these 
sufferings are experienced, in order to reject the insignificant pleasures 
and possessions of the world of becoming as food mixed with poison. 
Samsara is like a raging fire. We are determined from this moment on to 
apply a method that is certain to free ourselves from samsara. 
II. SPECIFIC PRELIMINARIES 
Within the four specific preliminaries, we find: 
-instructions. for taking Refuge and generating the mind of Awakening which 
transform the mind into an adequate vessel and bring all acts onto the path of 
liberation 
-Vajrasattoa meditation with recitation of the mantra, which purifies negative acts 
and veils 
-mandala practice which perfects the two accumulations 
-instruction on guru yoga which quickly confers grace 
1. TAKING REFUGE AND GENERATING THE MIND OF AWAKENING 
We should not search for any refuge other than the Three Jewels to 
protect us from the suffering of samsara. While we take refuge together 
with all the beings of the universe, we do the following visualization.

Facing us in space, the noble wish-fulfilling tree is divided into five 
branches. At the center where the branches converge, on a lion throne, 
a lotus, and the moon, sits the root lama, the sovereign Vajradhara. He 
is radiant and brilliant, perfectly endowed with all the physical marks 
and signs. Above him, the lamas of the lineage are placed one above the 
other. Then, in the front, on the right, rear, and left, respectively, are the 
yidams, the Buddhas, the Dharma, and the Sangha, gathered like clusters 
of clouds. Until perfect Awakening is attained, we take refuge and 
generate the sublime mind of Awakening, together with all beings. 
Finally, the sources of refuge dissolve into light and melt through our 
three gates. We dwell in the essence of the natural state. 
2. VAJRASATTVA MEDITATION WITH RECITATION OF THE MANTRA 
Whatever negative acts and transgression of vows we have accumulated 
since time without beginning, they are neutralized by the four strengths. 
The Vajrasattva meditation with the recitation of the mantra has the 
sublime power of acting like a complete antidote. Remaining in ordinary 
form, we imagine that above our head there is the lama Vajrasattva, 
white in color, holding in his right hand at the level of the heart a five­
pronged vajra, and in his left hand placed at his hip, a bell; he sits in the 
Bodhisattva posture. We visualize his transparent body as appearing, yet 
lacking substantiality. In his heart, on a moon disc, the one hundred 
syllables are circling the syllable HUNG. From there, nectar pours down 
and enters us through the Brahma orifice. The nectar purifies faults and 
veils, damages and violation of the vows without exception. Then, we 
again address a prayer to Vajrasattva and rejoicing, he replies, "You are 
purified of all faults and veils." Thus we are rejuvenated. Vajrasattva 
then dissolves into light and melts into us. We become one with his three 
vajras. 
3. OFFERING THE MANDALA 
Through the sublime method of offering the universe, the two 
accumulations of merit and wisdom are accomplished. To do so, we need 
an accomplishment mandala made of precious unstained material. We 
visualize it perfectly in front of us as a magnificent palace endowed with 
all characteristics. At its center, there are the root lamas and the lamas of 
the lineage; in the four directions, there are the yidams, the Buddhas, the 
Dharma, the Sangha, and the dakas, dakinis, and wisdom protectors. 
Holding the offering mandala, we offer, through making them appear in 
our mind, myriads of Mount Meru, continents and subcontinents, our 
body, possessions, positive accumulation, all that belongs to us and to the 
beings of the universe without exception. Through the power of this 
offering, the two accumulations are accomplished. The deities rejoice, 
dissolve into light and melt into us. We become indivisible.

4. GURU YOCA 
The basis of all qualities, particularly the sublime method of realizing 
ultimate truth-Mahamudra-is nothing other than the grace of the 
glorious lama. Therefore, to accomplish this yoga, we visualize ourselves 
as a yidam. Above our head, there is the root lama, the sovereign 
Vajradhara. Above him, there are the lamas of the lineage arranged in 
tiers. Vajradhara is also surrounded by the yidams, Buddhas, 
Bodhisattvas, dakas, dakinis, and wisdom protectors. We make offerings 
and pray to them with fervor. By the power of this, the retinue melts into 
the main figure, and the latter becomes the union of all the sources of 
refuge. We pray for Vajradhara to confer the empowerments, and we 
receive the four empowerments. We are purified from the four veils 
while receiving the seed of the four Bodies. Then the lama rejoices, melts 
into light, and is absorbed into us. We dwell evenly in the state of 
Mahamudra. 
III. SPECIAL PRELIMINARIES 
1. CAUSAL FACTOR 
Perfectly mastering our stream of mind, having cut away any attachment 
and bond, inclined to disinterest for this world, and inclined to the wish 
for liberation, we dwell alone in a very secluded place and renounce any 
activity containing outer or inner distractions. 
2. PRINCIPAL FACTOR 
Because the path that brings us to realize Mahamudra depends solely on 
the lama, we need to be directed by an authentic spiritual friend. This 
master assumes four aspects. 
a) The master as human being belonging to a lineage 
That is a lama belonging to a perfectly pure lineage through which the 
continuity of grace, direct instructions, and so on, have been transmitted 
without interruption from Vajradhara to our root lama. 
b) The master as Awakened word 
When the certainty inspired by the lama's teaching is obtained in our 
mind, and when we experience that this teaching is in no way 
contradictory to the word of the Buddha, all the teachings of the Buddha 
manifest as direct instructions.

c) The master as symbolic appearances 
Given that all material phenomena of samsara and nirvana, outer or 
inner, whether elements or transformations of elements, show us the 
aspects of the path by signs and by metaphors, there is nothing other 
than the lama. 
d) The master as ultimate nature (dharmata) 
Through the direct vision, the realization, and the sure and unmistaken 
underst;mding of the nature of our own mind, we realize the ultimate 
nature of all phenomena. 
3. OBJECTIVE FACTOR 
Not entering the considerations of philosophical systems, Buddhist or 
non-Buddhist, and not tarnished by concepts, we practice only with the 
essence of the mind, as the primordial mode of being, the play of the 
three Bodies. 
4. IMMEDIATE FACTOR 
When we accomplish the body of the practice, without conceiving an 
object of meditation or a meditator, we only maintain the essence of 
ordinary awareness without accepting or rejecting anything, without 
hope or fear, and without mental fabrication. 
Body of the Practice 
I. MENTAL CALMING [SHINAY] 
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
1. BASIC PHYSICAL POSTURE 
The basic physical posture comprises the seven points of Vairocana. 
1) the legs in vajra posture 
2) the hands in the mudra of meditation 
3) the shoulders spread like the wings of a vulture 
4) the neck slightly bent like a hook 
5) the spine straight as an arrow 
6) the eyes gazing into space about four fingers from the tip of the nose 
7) the lips and teeth naturally relaxed, tongue against the palate 
We position ourselves on a comfortable seat.

2. BASIC MENTAL ATTITUDE 
The basic attitude of the mind is pointed out in these terms: "Do not 
reflect, do not conceive, do not think, do not meditate, do not analyze, 
rest naturally." The spontaneous ordinary awareness is free of stopping 
and creating, refusal and acceptance, hope or fear, attachment and 
grasping to a reality. We rest in this essence, relaxed in the relaxation, 
without distraction, with one-pointed attention, without grasping to 
clarity or emptiness, in the nondoing. 
B. SPECIFIC METHODS 
1. ANCHORING THE WANDERING MIND 
a) Anchoring the mind with an object 
1) External 
(a) Anchoring the mind with an impure object 
We perfectly assume the basic posture of the body and the gaze. As 
support before us, we focus our attention on a pillar, a wall, or any other 
form of a large size. Without being distracted by anything else, we 
remain evenly in this one-pointed attention. Similarly, we anchor our 
mind without distraction on a form of small size such as a piece of wood 
or a pebble placed in front of us. We may further use a butter lamp or 
the sky, or a white sphere of light between the eyebrows, the size of a 
pea, as supports of attention to anchor the mind. 
(b) Anchoring the mind with a pure object 
We imagine clearly before us the perfect Buddha Bhagavan. With faith 
and respect, we visualize the appropriate color, clothing, marks, and 
physical signs. Doing this with single-pointed attention, the mind is 
anchored. 
2) Anchoring the mind internally 
In the center of an eight-petalled lotus in our heart, we generate the 
image of a yidam of our choice, or we meditate on the lama, or we 
visualize a sphere of light that is their essence. Doing this the mind is 
anchored. In this way, we remain without distraction on the supports of 
attention, maintaining the position of the gaze, free of the defects of being 
too tense or too relaxed. Besides the awareness of a remote watch, there 
is nothing to do. Gentle and flexible, we rest in natural ease, without 
rejecting or adding anything, without hope or fear, relaxed in the 
relaxation. 
b) Anchoring the mind without object 
Either we anchor the mind first on the great emptiness of all material 
phenomena, external and internal, or we rest in the clear light-great 
emptiness after the dissolution of material phenomena into each other.

c) Anchoring the mind with the breath 
To anchor the mind with the breath, we concentrate on the vase 
breathing or, counting "one" for a cycle of inhaling-retaining-exhaling, 
we maintain our attention to a count of 21 or more cycles. With 
nondistraction, clarity, and stamina, we practice many short sessions. 
By the power of meditating according to these instructions, the three 
stages of stability will gradually occur: 
-the first is similar to a stream rushing down a steep mountain 
-the second is similar to a quiet river 
-the final stage is like a motionless ocean 
2. STABIUZING THE ANCHORED MIND 
a) Fastening the mind 
1) Fastening the mind above 
At the center of a four-petalled lotus in our heart there is a white sphere 
of light the size of a pea. We fix the mind upon it, holding the breath. 
While we exhale, the sphere exits through the orifice of Brahma and 
dissolves into space. Thinking that we dwell there, we straighten the 
physical posture and gaze upward. As for the mind, we generate 
enthusiasm, and with heightened awareness, we meditate for a long 
duration. 
2) Fastening the mind below 
For the second way of fastening the mind, in the center of an upside 
down, black, four-petalled lotus in the heart, there is a black sphere the 
size of a pea. Unfolding like a spider's thread, it slowly exits the secret 
gate, with a sense of heaviness, going many miles down. Stabilized by 
this, the mind is anchored in one-pointed awareness. The buttocks need . 
to be tightened. Meditate with a downward posture and gaze. 
3) Alternating practice 
In relation to the right measure, if the mind is too high, we draw it 
downward; if it is too low, we direct it upward. Continuously, like a 
flowing river, we practice the yoga of alternating these two 
visualizations. 
b) The nine ways of stabilizing the mind 
1. Settling 
2. Completely settling 
3. Certain! y settling 
4. Thorough! y settling 
5. Taming 
6. Pacifying 
7. Thoroughly pacifying 
8. Establishing one-pointedness 
9. Resting evenly

30 
These skillful means are explained as follows: 
1. Settling: placing one pointed attention on any object 
2. Completely settling: keeping the previous stability for a long duration 
3. Certainly settling: if thoughts occur, they are identified immediately by 
awareness, then resting evenly. 
4. Thoroughly settling: in addition to having previously settled the 
stabilized mind, clarifying it, and then resting evenly. 
5. Taming: remembering perfectly the qualities of the stabilized mind, 
generating joy, and remaining in this state. 
6. Pacifying: identifying the cause of any production [of thought], 
whatever it is by "Here it is!" Being certain to have discovered it, turning 
away from the attraction. 
7. Thoroughly pacifying: identifying the causes of distraction and the 
essence of unhappy states, and so on; they are spontaneously liberated; 
remaining stable. 
8. Establishing one-pointedness: having the ability to remain stable while 
contemplating the object by the power of a familiarization disregarding 
effort. 
9. Resting evenly: finally, staying free of all distractions whether resting 
evenly or not [in meditation]. 
3. ENHANCING THE STABIUTY 
We direct the awareness to forms which appear as visual objects, then 
sounds, and so on, using them successively as supports of awareness. We 
settle our mind on them with one-pointedness. In the same way, 
whatever thoughts arise, we do not look at them as defects, but instantly, 
we settle our mind on them. To remove tension and sloth, and most 
particularly, to dispel obstacles and enhance the practice, the best way is 
to pray to the lama, and through devotion, blend our mind and the 
lamas's mind into one. 
II. SUPERIOR VISION [LHAKTHONG) 
1. OBsERVING THE MODE OF BEING, THE ESSENCE OF THE MIND 
The way to observe the essential nature of the mind is to leave the mind 
in natural ease, in nondoing, relaxed in relaxation. We look again and 
again, examining and analyzing it. What is its essence, color, shape, form, 
size, and so on? H we ask what this essence of the stable mind is, it must 
be clarity, presence, and bareness. When we look for stability and do not 
find it, then, we should let the production (of thoughts) arise and 
examine it.

2. CUTTING UNCERTAINTY 
Here is how to cut uncertainty. When we search, if we do not find 
anything, who is the one searching? How does the mind arise, dwell, and 
disappear? Perfectly examining, we must continuously search. 
There are the 11 recollections. 
1. thorough search and analysis 
2. separate analysis 
3. detailed analysis 
4. mental calming [shinay] 
5. superior vision [lhakthong] 
6. combining both 
7. clarity 
8. nonthought 
9. equanimity 
10. noninterruption 
11. nondistraction 
The explanation of each of these points is as follows. 
1. Does the mind exist or not? What is its essence? We search in the 
stream of mind, which is continuity. 
2. In particular, we eliminate doubts about its color, shape, and so on, its 
origin, location, and disappearance. 
3. The searcher searches, up to the end, the one who searches. 
4. Realizing through searching that the mind lacks an inherent nature, the 
mind remains perfectly stable in the profound meaning in order to also 
arrive at a conclusion about the essential nature of all phenomena. 
5. Searching as before for the essence of that which remains stable, we 
realize its own face completely. 
6. The two preceding [points] are neither different nor dissociated. 
7. If through torpor, obscuration occurs, we revitalize the mind by 
producing causes of agitation. 
8. If production [of thoughts] and agitation occur, we apply the methods 
for calming. 
9. When we are free from torpor and agitation, we remain in the essence 
of the one who is searching, examining, and analyzing. 
10. Never be separated from this yoga. 
11. Perfectly maintained in this yoga, the mind has no occasion to be 
distracted. 
Through these 11 recollections, we continuously apply the methods 
that cut away uncertainty.

3. POINTING OUT INSTRUCTIONS TO CONCLUDE THAT AWARENESS Is EMPTINESS 
The instructions to conclude that awareness is empty are like this. First, 
we place the relaxed mind in its own nature. We look at the essence of 
this relaxed mind in its bareness. We maintain one pointed awareness 
that is simply nondistracted. Whatever thoughts arise, we do not reject 
them or intentionally accept them. We do not mentally create anything 
but rest vividly and openly in ordinary mind, in the instant, and in a 
clarity without identification. 
Additional ways of pointing out. 
a) Pointing out through movement 
The way of pointing out through movement is first to let the mind settle 
in its own nature in a relaxed way. In this state, we look at its own 
essence. Then, we induce a movement. What is then the difference 
between the moving mind and the stable mind? What is the difference 
between the moving mind and the mind that observes it? Observing like 
this, the movement is spontaneously liberated. We dwell without 
distraction and with one pointed attention in this state. 
b) Pointing out through appearances 
1) Pointing out appearances as mind 
We examine whether the forms and other supports of objective 
perception are one with the mind or are different. When we realize that 
all objects which externally appear have no existence except as reflections 
of the mind, we continually rest in this state without fixation. 
2) Pointing out mind as emptiness 
The mind in itself is nothing existing but emptiness. It can be illustrated 
by nothing. Beyond word, thought, description, it is like space. We dwell 
relaxed in this state, without fabrication. 
3) Pointing out emptiness as spontaneous presence 
Manifestation, radiance, and unimpededness arise in diversity, unmoving 
from the domain of emptiness. We must understand that there is nothing 
but emptiness; all appearances, all phenomena of samsara and nirvana 
are the spontaneous presence of inseparable appearance and emptiness. 
4) Pointing out self-liberation as spontaneous presence 
Likewise, appearances, awareness, and emptiness are primordially the 
spontaneous presence of the union of clarity and emptiness. With no 
need for antidotes that reject, take, disregard, or establish, this is the self­
liberation of reality, the Mahamudra.

Post-Practice 
After we have experienced our own essence as pointed out by the latnll, we enhance 
and refine this experience, dispel hindrances, tread the path, and actualize the result. 
I. ENHANCEMENT 
1. ENHANCEMENT THROUGH EUMINATING FIVE FAlSE IDEAS 
a) How to eliminate false ideas about objects 
Without grasping something real in the notion of samsara that must be 
abandoned and nirvana that must be actualized, but pladng ourselves in 
the infinite one-taste of primordial awareness [of knowing] the 
nonduality of all phenomena gathered by pairs such as virtue and 
nonvirtue, we eliminate false ideas about objects. 
b) How to eliminate false ideas about time 
Although there is no fundamental truth about the reality of the three 
times, we think within a mode obscured by the division into three times. 
Consequently, realizing equanimity which does not establish a distinction 
of the three times, we eliminate the false ideas about time. 
c) How to eliminate false ideas about essence 
We have a mistaken desire to abandon this present mind to obtain an 
external primordial awareness. Recognizing that our mind is originally 
of the nature of the five wisdoms, we eliminate the false ideas about 
essence. 
d) How to eliminate false ideas about nature 
All aggregates, elements, and systems of perception of beings are 
primordially of the nature of the masculine and feminine tathagatas and 
deities. Recognizing this, we eliminate false ideas about nature. 
e) How to eliminate false ideas about knowledge 
Absolute truth is no object of great intelligence or analytical discourse. It 
is realized through the grace of the lama and with favorable karmic 
potential. In this way, the false ideas about knowledge are eliminated. 
2. TRAINING IN THE THREE SKILlS 
a) Skillfulness in beginning meditation 
We place our body in the basic posture. If [thoughts] arise, we look at the 
essence of the production [of thoughts]; if the mind is stable, we look at 
the essence of the stability. We remain in a state of natural ease, 
nonfabrication, freshness, relaxation, in the simple recognition of our own 
essence, without distraction.

b) Skillfulness in ending meditation 
Not considering it essential to meditate for long periods of time, but 
modifying the methods of meditation and physical posture, we do many 
short sessions keeping the mind clear, radiant, and vivid. Not ending the 
meditation in resentment, we generate enthusiasm. 
c) Skillfulness in maintaining meditation 
Whenever experiences of joy, clarity, and nonthought occur, if we 
conceive attachment or pride, it is called losing realization to the 
experience. It is therefore necessary to maintain [the meditation] in a state 
without attachment to the experience. 
3. ENHANCEMENT THROUGH EUMINATING MISTAKES AND WANDERINGS 
a) Mistakes 
1) Mistaking emptiness, the nature of objects of knowledge 
Studying scriptures and sciences, we conclude through reasoning that the 
essential nature of matter is empty. We think, "Since everything is empty, 
on what are we to meditate?" H emptiness is established only 
intellectually, it is not authentic emptiness. 
2) Mistaking the seal 
What is called mistaking the seal of emptiness is when we think that all 
material phenomena that we do not perceive as empty are made empty 
by reciting mantras such as the mantra called sunyata. This is only a 
meditation; it is not authentic emptiness. 
3) Mistaking the antidote 
What is called mistaking emptiness as the antidote is when thoughts 
occur and we think, "I will conquer them by emptiness." This way of 
being placed in emptiness is stained. 
4) Mistaking the path 
What is called mistaking emptiness as the path is thinking that treading 
the path with meditation on emptiness now-although path and result 
are not separated-we will obtain the result later. This is not authentic. 
b) Enhancement through eliminating wandering while meditating 
The way of enhancement through eliminating wandering will be shown 
in 17 successive points. 
1. Among the three types of experiences-joy, clarity, and 
nonthought-let us take the example of joy. While not distinguishing 
between conditioned and nonconditioned joy, we generally examine this 
joy through knowledge. H, meditating on this joy, a true attachment 
occurs, it is wandering in the desire realm.

2. In the sam~ way, if attachment to the experience of clarity occurs, it is 
wandering in the form realm. 
3. H attachment to nonthought occurs, we will take rebirth in the formless 
realm. It is said that there all phenomena are similar to space. If, 
analyzing this through knowledge, a thorough attachment occurs, we will 
take rebirth in the system of perception of limitless space. 
4. From clinging to the idea that all phenomena are mind, we wander in 
the system of perception of limitless individual consciousness. 
5. H attached to the idea that nothing exists, we wander in the system of 
perception of nothing whatsoever. 
6. If attachment to the idea that neither existence nor nonexistence occurs, 
we will take rebirth in the system of perception of neither discrimination 
nor nondiscrimination. 
Consequently, let us eliminate these wanderings by· being free of 
attachment to the experiences of joy, clarity, and nonthought, but by 
seeing our own face. 
7. H there is attachment to emptiness separated from skillful means, we 
then wander in inferior states. The way to reject this is to develop love, 
compassion, and the mind of Awakening. 
8. Through skillful means, we enhance wisdom. 
9. Through wisdom, we enhance skillful means. 
10. By integrating both, enhancing one we will enhance the other. 
11. Enhancing mental calming is done by superior vision. 
12. Enhancing superior vision is done by mental calming. 
13. At the level of one-pointedness, for both mental calming and superior 
vision, enhancement of the experience is done by experience. 
14. At the level of nonfabrication, enhancement of the realization is done 
by experience. 
15. At the level of one taste, enhancement of the realization is done by 
realization. 
16. Without rejecting the three gates as being ordinary, anything we do 
is transformed into virtue; ordinary qualities are enhanced. 
17. Without rejecting or accepting defects such as conflicting emotions, 
suffering, and obstacles, we look at our own face. Enhancement is done 
by taking bad omens as blessings. 
4. ENHANCEMENT THROUGH LmERATION FROM THE THREE PERILOUS PATHS 
a) Emptiness arising as an enemy 
When we analyze and examine the essence of the mind, we see nothing 
existing. Since all phenomena are empty, we think that positive and 
negative acts, as well as the law of karma, do not exist. Considering that 
there is nothing to reject and no antidote to apply is called nihilism. As 
emptiness arises as an enemy, we reject this thought like poison.

b) Compassion arising as an enemy 
Having obtained some degree of joy in meditation, we think, "I must 
liberate those beings who lack this joy." We abandon meditation, and 
with many tangible efforts, we accomplish positive compounded actions 
and cling to them as real. This is called compassion arising as an enemy. 
Abandoning this attitude, we try, without departing from the compassion 
which has arisen, to keep our realization stainless. 
c) Cause arising as an enemy of the result 
We think that to see the profound nature of the mind, we must be 
learned in all domains. Therefore, we apply ourselves to grammar, 
debate, and so on, and we abandon the practice of mental calming and 
superior vision. If we do this, it is what is called the causes [studies] 
arising as enemy of the result [Mahamudra]. This is not authentic. 
Meditating with one-pointedness on the profound meaning, we obtain an 
immaculate knowledge that is not obscured by phenomena of the cycle 
of manifestation or nirvana. 
II. DISPELLING HINDRANCES 
1. ILLNESS 
Practicing mental calming dispels illnesses of wind. The illnesses of 
phlegm and bile are eliminated by practicing superior vision. Hot and 
cold illnesses are both gradually eliminated by mental calming and 
superior vision. Furthermore, we examine the essence of all illnesses, 
their form, origin, location, and disappearance. Visualization of sending 
and taking is emphasized. lllness being unborn, it is the Absolute Body 
(dharmakaya); being without location, it is the Body of Enjoyment 
(sambhogakaya); being without cessation, it is the Body of Emanation 
(nirmanakaya); its nature being emptiness, it is the Body of Essence Itself 
(svabhavikakaya). Integrating illness to practice as the play of the four 
Bodies, we see our own mind. 
2. DEMONS [MAUGNANT FORCES] 
In the same way, we dispel the hindrances of demons. What appears as 
a demon is an effect of the magic display of the mind. Looking at the 
mind as being itself the four Bodies, we eliminate demons in the same 
way through integrating the four Bodies as the path. 
3. MEDITATION 
We have seen the general methods for dispelling the defects of torpor 
and agitation. Here, they are dispelled through guru yoga. When we sink 
in torpor, we visualize Lama Amitabha above our head; once the lamas 
of the lineage melt into Amitabha, we pray to the lama with devotion. 
Light then radiates from him and melts into us, thoroughly purifying the 
causes of torpor. Lama Amitabha melts into light and merges with us.

Our body, now a mass of light, illuminates all the realms of manifestation 
then dissolves in space. We keep this awareness vivid and intense. H we 
are agitated, we visualize Lama Vajrasattva, blue-green in color, on a 
four-petalled lotus in our heart. On these four petals, there are Vairocana 
and the other Conquerors, surrounded by their particular families of 
dakas and dakinis with the same respective colors. Blue light emanates 
from their hearts and penetrates the lama. We visualize that all beams of 
light extend to all cardinal points and intermediate directions. Remaining 
stable in the state of Mahamudra, we dispel agitation. In addition, 
whenever torpor or agitation arises, let us remain relaxed in their 
essence, with nondistraction, nonmeditation, and nonfabrication. 
III. TREADING THE PATH 
How the path unfolds is shown within the framework of the four yogr~s. Dilliding each of them 
in three let~els-lesser, intermediate, and superioT>- they becvme 12 stages. 
1. ONE-POINTEDNESS 
First, there is the yoga of one-pointedness. Properly knowing the face of 
the mind, the meditator dwells vividly and intensely in the state of 
clarity, emptiness, and unimpededness-like space without limit or 
center. Among the three levels-lesser, intermediate, and superior- in 
the lesser level, we see the essence of joy-clarity; in the intermediate level, 
we master meditative concentration (samadhi); in the superior level, the 
experience of meditative concentration (samadhi) becomes unlimited. 
2. NONFABRICATION 
Nonfabrication is the realization of the mind in itself and without 
foundation. When we are free of fabrications-such as the notions of 
object and subject, the notions of origin, cessation, and location of all 
phenomena as well as clinging to characteristics-all speculations are 
eliminated in unborn emptiness. At the lesser level, we realize our own 
mind as unborn. At the intermediate level, we have no clinging to 
appearances and emptiness. At the superior level, speculations on 
fabrication of all phenomena are eliminated. 
3. ONE-TASTE 
The yoga of one-taste blends appearances and mind. Regarding all 
phenomena of the cycle of appearances and nirvana as equal, we dwell 
in a natural state. This state is neither devoid nor nondevoid of 
fabrications such as origin and cessation, emptiness and nonemptiness. 
It is without action of negating or making exist, and abandoning or 
undertaking. At the lesser level, paired phenomena are blended into one­
taste. At the intermediate level, appearances and mind are like water 
poured into water. At the superior level, all phenomena are pacified in 
a state of equality.

4. NONMEDITATION 
Former experiences and feelings are cleansed. It also said that the 
intellect is entirely exhausted. This is nonmeditation. Of the three 
levels-lesser, intermediate, and superior-at the lesser level, we are 
completely devoid of the notions of meditation and meditator; at the 
intermediate level, we reach spontaneous presence. At the superior level, 
the mother and daughter clear lights are blended. From then on, we are 
open to the immensity of primordial awareness of suchness 
(dharmadhatu). Consequently, the two benefits are fulfilled-Buddhahood 
is attained. 
• Correspondence between the 12 levels of the yogas (4 x 3) and the paths 
Establishing a correspondence between the fulfilled levels of the 12 yogas 
and the paths, we arrive at: 
-one-pointedness, lesser level = path of accumulation 
-one-pointedness, intermediate = path of junction, heat, and peak 
-one-pointedness, superior = patience and sublime Dharma 
-nonfabrication, lesser = path of vision and first Bodhisattva ground 
-nonfabrication, intermediate = from the second to the fifth ground 
-nonfabrication, superior = attainment of the sixth ground 
-one-taste, realization of the lesser = seventh ground 
-one-taste, intermediate = eighth ground 
-one-taste, superior = ninth ground 
-nonmeditation, lesser= tenth ground 
-nonmeditation, intermediate = ground of the end of continuity 
-nonmeditation, superior = completion of the path, eleventh ground 
IV. ACfUALIZING THE RESULT 
In this way, by the 12 yogas born in the stream of mind, we finally reach 
the nonmeditation. The two veils and latent conditioning are eliminated; 
the two knowledges, wisdoms, and ripenings are fulfilled. Although not 
leaving the Absolute Body (dhannakaya) which benefits ourselves, through 
the Formal Body (rupakaya) we accomplish the benefit of others, free of 
concept, effort, and fabrication until samsara is emptied. It is a constant 
activity and spontaneous omnipresent essence.

By the substantial effurts and virtuous activity in all my births and lives, may 
I remain disengaged from the activity of becoming and may I not transgress 
~en the slightest fundamental aspect of training (in ethics) in all times. 
May I not forget, ~en in dreams, the two sublime Bodhicittas that benefit 
others; may I be able to establish all beings in happiness by the Jour foundations 
of gathering and the six paramitas. 
Regarding the perfectly pure spiritual friends with as much love as for my own 
life, may I satisfy them with all satisfactions and remain with faith and vows 
[samaya]. 
By the power of such wishes, through studying, rt!flecting, and meditating on 
all the baskets-those of individual liberation, of bodhisattvas, and of the 
mantras of the vidhyadharas-may I benefit myself. May I benefit others through 
explanation, debate, and composition. May I accomplish both benefits through 
erudition, observance, and good nature. May I accomplish the benefit of the 
doctrine as its holder, protector, and propagator. 
May I realize the changeless philosophy of certainty and, in particular, the 
Mahamudra of the mode of being [nature of the mind]; may I contribute to the 
flourishing of the Dharma for others. 
In short, may I alone be able to establish all the incarnate beings who inhabit the 
ends of space, into the sublime state of pure and perfect Awakening. 
By the blessing of the Three Jewels and the Conquerors, by the power of perfectly 
pure great aspiration and by the force of emptiness and profound 
interdependence, may these wishes be fulfilled. 
The Sixth Sharmapa, Choky Wangchuk, wrote a guide for the Six Dharmas of 
Naropa, titled The Condensed AmbrosiJr of the Six Dharmas. I summarized the 
essence of this text in the form of a root text in verses to recite during the 
practice. Because while practicing, such a text is very helpful, I thought for 
some time that we should have one for Mahamudra. Nedo Kuchung 
Choktrul Rinpoche and Lama Tsethar from Tilyal had wanted, during their 
three-year retreat, to print the root text of these Six Dharmas of Naropa. They 
then encouraged me to write a similar text for Mahamudra. I conceived of 
this project for beginners in the practice, with the excellent aspiration to bring 
them help. This text was written by Bokar Tulku Karma Ngedon Choky 
Lodro, the lama, master of retreat of the great retreat center of Yi-ong Samten 
Ling, attached to the seat of the Lord of the Conquerors, the glorious 
Karmapa, the seat called Omin Shedrup Chokhor Ling. Written in Mirik, 
district of Darjeeling, a land which is a balm for the mind, at Bokar Ngedon 
Chokhor Ling, on December 13, 1984, the twentieth day of the lOth month of 
the wood-rat year, at the moment of the conjunction of Thursday, the eighth 
constellation, fire, and air. 
May virtue increase!

and equanimity) and application (practice of the six perfections or 
paramitas). 
BODHISATTVA: Being who follows the bodhicitta path and seeks to

ordinary being who commits to practice bodhicitta. One who has attained 
Awakening and dwells in one of the ten grounds or stages of the 
bodhisattvas. A bodhisattva can be physically present in our world or 
abide in domains of more subtle manifestation. 
BODHISA TTY A POSTURE: Seated with legs crossed, left heel against the

BUDDHA NATURE: Potential of Awakening inherent in all beings. 
BUDDHA: One who has awakened. A person, as the historical Buddha 
Sakyamuni. In Tibetan, Sangyay. Sang means purified from the conflicting

CONFLICTING EMOTIONS: Desire-attachment, hatred-aversion, 
ignorance or mental dullness, jealousy, pride, and so on. 
CONSOOUSNESS: From a dualistic point of view, each object of the 
senses corresponds to a consciousness. There are six or eight 
consciousnesses depending on their classification. First, let us consider six 
consciousnesses: 
-visual consciousness (forms) 
-auditory consciousness (sounds) 
-olfactory consciousness (smells) 
-gustatory consciousness (tastes) 
-tactile consciousness (tangible objects) 
-mental consciousness (imaginary objects) 
One can add two other consciousnesses: 
-disturbed consciousness or ego consciousness, which corresponds to the 
influence of conflicting emotions on our relationship to phenomena, 
-potential of consciousness or "all-ground consciousness"(Sanskrit, 
alayavijnana}, which contains all the latent conditionings of karma.
