THE TWELFTH  TAI SITUPA
Foreword
The great Indian Mahapandita Arya Asanga, due to
his great aspiration and realization, was able to
communicate directly with Arya Maitreya, BuddhaShakyamuni’s regent and the future Buddha. From thisencounter, the Five Great Shastras of Maitreya came into thisworld, which I am delighted to know are being published byZhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Publications under Venerable LamaShedrup.
These great teachings from Maitreya constitute one of the major
foundations of the bodhisattva path, providing teachings onboth the relative and ultimate truths and elucidating the secondand third turnings of the Wheel of Dharma, the Prajnaparamitaand Tathagatagarbha.
In order to understand the profound and vast meaning of these
texts, one of my own philosophy teachers, the erudite Kagyuscholar and supreme abbot of the lineage, Khenchen ThranguRinpoche, through his great wisdom and compassion haselucidated these texts with profound clarity and simplicity.

10 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
I pray that these publications, which give a clear understanding
of the Teachings of Lord Buddha, guide limitless sentient beingsswiftly to supreme enlightenment.
Yours in The Holy Dharma

VENERABLE  CHOJE LAMA KARMA
SHEDRUP  CHO GYI SENGE KARTUNG
Preface
It is with great joy that Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal now offers
    this second edition in our series on the five great works of Arya
Maitreya – The Changeless Nature  (The Uttaratantrashastra ), a treatise
on Buddha-Essence; The Ornament of Clear Realization
(Abhisamayalankara ), a text on the Prajnaparamita; Differentiating the
Middle from the Extremes  (Madhyantavibhaga ), a text on the Middle-
way school; Differentiating Dharma and Dharmata
(Dharmadharmatavibhaga ), a text also discussing the Buddha-essence;
and The Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras  (Mahayanasutralankara ).
These works, transmitted from Arya Maitreya – the fifth and
future Buddha of this fortunate age – to Arya Asanga some time inthe third century,  comprise one of the major foundations of Mahayana
Buddhism, the unbroken transmission and practice of whichcontinues today.
As is mentioned in the text: “Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata
is a text that is very brief and direct in its presentation and is includedwithin the class of oral instructions. It is a work which clearly portraysthe character of nothing less than non-conceptual original wisdom,the point of utmost profundity within the Mahayana.
With regard to meditation, there are the particular traditions,
views and practices of Mahamudra and Dzogchen, the basis of whichare the teachings of the Buddha and the commentaries or shastras onthose by the great masters. In order to achieve the high view of

12 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
Mahamudra or Dzogchen we need to cut our doubts, hinderances
and aberrations, which is accomplished by listening to andcontemplating the Mahayana dharma.
Realizing dharmata or the nature of mind is what is to be known
and this we understand through hearing and thinking about it.Nevertheless, due to the obstruction of conventional appearances weare not able to realize this. If we can realize this profound nature thenwe will naturally separate from confusion and conventionalappearances. Thus, this text, Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata , is
devoted to identifying exactly what is conventionally true and what isultimately true. So this text is extremely important for all those whowish to practice the meditations of Mahamudra and Dzogchen.”
Through the great blessing of the Kagyu lineage, in particular
through His Eminence Tai Situ Rinpoche, an emanation of Maitreya,and Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche we have produced these works forpublication in order that they be available worldwide for dharmastudents. We pray that through this all beings swiftly accomplishenlightenment and that it be a cause for the long life and the flourishingactivity of the great masters.

At twenty-three he received full ordination from the Karmapa.
When he was twenty-seven, Rinpoche left Tibet for India at the timeof the Communist invasion. He was called to Rumtek, Sikkim, wherethe Karmapa had his seat in exile.

To the guardian Maitreya we bow in supplication.2. Something there is to be given up fully through knowing
And something else which can only be actualized,Because of which this treatise has been composedWith the wish to distinguish the traits defining these.
3. A summary of everything in brief
Should be known to include the following two motifs,Since everything can be summarized fully in termsOf phenomena together with pure being.
4. That which is classified here as phenomena
Is samsara; that which is classified preciselyAs pure being is nirvana, transcendence of grief,As this is defined by the vehicles, which are three.

5. Here the traits of phenomena are defined
As duality plus assumption and formulation,Whose appearance is the mistaken conceptual process,Since what appears is not and is thus not real.No referents have ever existed eitherAnd, being but concept, consist of conceptualization.
6. The other factor, pure being, is defined
As suchness, in which there is no differentiationBetween a factor perceived and a perceiver,A signifier contra a signified.
7. Because what does not exist appears, delusion
Provides the cause for completely afflicted states;Since things like illusory elephants appear,Even what does exist does not appear.
8. If either the lack of existence or the appearance
Were missing, delusion and freedom from delusionAnd likewise states afflicted in every respectAnd thorough refinement would be unjustified.The Root T ext

9. These two are not one and the same nor do they differ,
Because, between that which exists and that which does not,A distinction exists and yet does not exist.
10. Because it provides a thorough introduction
To their characteristics as well as their rationale,Their neither being the same nor different,The ground in common and not in common shared,And the lack of appearance involving perceiver-perceived,This six-point approach to phenomena is the best.
11. Of these, the defining traits and the rationale,
As well as the lack of sameness and difference,Are just as these were demonstrated in brief.The Root T ext

12. As long as there is someone circling somewhere,
These are the grounds in each and every case –The constituents of beings and those of the vessel.The constituents of the vessel appear to be shared,The awareness being the common experience;Some of the constituents of beingsAre experienced in common and some are not.
13. Further, birth and conventions, to nurture, subdue,
Benefit, harm, excellent features and faultsAre mutually caused by way of an interchange,Because of which these are experience shared in common.
14. Since the ground and awareness, happiness, suffering,
Action, transition at death, captivity, birth,And liberation are not observed in common,They comprise the realm of experience not shared in common.The Root T ext

15. What appear to be outer, perceivable in common,
Are perceiving awareness; they are not referentsExisting as something extrinsic to consciousness,Precisely because they are common experiences.
16. The counterpart is the one in which what is perceived
Is not shared in common. Here awareness’ referentIs the minds and so on associated with others.These do not comprise an object of mutual exchangeFor perceiving awareness not resting nor resting poised,Because, for those not resting in equipoise,It is but their own conceptions that appear;And because, for those who are resting in equipoise,It is its faithful reflection that appearsAs the object encountered during samadhi absorption.The Root T ext

17. If what appears as perceived does not exist,
Whatever appears as perceiver does not exist;Due to this, there is also a rationaleBehind the breakthrough to freedom from this appearanceOf perceived and perceiver, because without beginningA volatile state prevails; and because duality’sNot existing at all is what really exists.
18. Through introducing traits and a ground at all times,
Definitive verification as well as encounter,Recollection and immersion into its core,This six-point approach to pure being is unsurpassed.The Root T ext

19. The defining traits in brief are just as they are.
20. The ground consists of the whole of phenomena
And supreme teachings, the whole of the sutra collections.
21. The term “definitive verification of this”
Refers to the whole of the path of application,Comprised of appropriate mental cultivationBased on the sutra collections of Mahayana.
22. The encounter attained because of authentic view
Is the path of vision, on which the suchness attainedIs in a fashion direct, whatever experienced.
23. Although reality has been seen by awareness,
Recollection – the path of meditation,Comprised of factors inducing enlightenment –Is needed to eliminate the stains.The Root T ext

24. Here, immersion into its core complete,
Is suchness rendered free of any stain,Where all appear exclusively as suchness –And this completes the transformation as well.
25. This ten-point presentation of transformation
Provides an unsurpassable introduction,Because it is the way to approach the essence,Ingredients and individuals,The special traits, requirements and ground,Mental cultivation and application,The disadvantages and benefits.
26. The essence of transformation is introduced
As suchness freed of stain, and what that meansIs superficial stains appear no longerAnd that which manifests is now the suchness.The Root T ext

30. The introduction to realizing what is required:
The distinguishing factor of previous wishing prayers;The distinguishing factor of Mahayana teachingAs focal point; and the further distinguishing factorOf effective application to all ten levels.
31. The introduction involving the ground or support
Is into original non-conceptual wisdomAs this is approached in a manner involving six points,Since the focal requirement, attributes surrendered,The correct way to apply the mind in practice,The defining characteristics and benefits,And full understanding are hereby introduced.The Root T ext

32. The first of these, the focal requirement,
Should be known to be introduced in four points,Since what is required is Mahayana teachings,Commitment to these, along with certitudeAnd fully completing the two accumulations.
33. The second, which treats of surrendering attributes,
Is also introduced by way of four points,Since what is unfavorable and the remedies,The suchness as well as the realization of thisAre attributes whose surrender leads the way.By doing this in respective order as follows –The coarse and the middling followed by those which are fine,And those which persist for a very long time indeed –These attributes are surrendered entirely.The Root T ext

Should be known to consist of the following three aspects,

Which means that one actually settles in pure being,The non-dualistic and inexpressible;The Root T ext

37. And one effect relates to appearances’ absence,
Where duality, assumption and formulation,Faculties, objects, principles of awareness,And vessel-like worlds’ appearances are absent;So these correspond to there being no observation,No description, no ground and no appearances,No principles of awareness, and no place,Which is how the sutras express the traitsDefining original non-conceptual wisdom;
38. And one effect relates to appearances’ presence,
Since experience of every phenomenonIs equivalent to the center of open space,And formations all are appearances like illusions.
39. The four points introducing the benefits
Include the complete attainment of dharmakaya,Attainment of bliss which nothing can exceed,Attainment of mastery over the power of insight,And attainment of mastery over the power to teach.The Root T ext

Should be known to include the following four points:A full understanding regarding the remedy;A full understanding regarding the characteristic;A full understanding regarding distinctive marks;And a full understanding regarding the five effects.
41. What is to be understood as the remedy here
Is non-conceptualizing original wisdom,Since perceiving phenomena, individuals,An alteration as well as dichotomy,Denial as well, when this is entertained,Are five distinct forms of perception of non-existentsFor which it is taught to comprise the remedy.
42. Fully understanding the characteristic:
A lack of the process of thought and correct transcendence,T ranquilization, things in their composition,And predetermination are the fiveThe exclusion of which is the concrete characteristic.The Root T ext

43. Completely understanding its marks refers
To its being free of conceptualization as such,To the fact that it is not transitional,To its not remaining while being there all along,And its hallmark of being completely unexcelled;These make up its five distinctive marks.
44. The last, the full understanding of its effects,
Includes its lasting effect on conceptualization;Its affording unsurpassable happiness;Its effecting elimination of obscurations –Afflicted emotions and cognitive obscurations;The original wisdom attained in the wake of thisProvides the access to every aspect of knowledge;It enables achieving attunement with Buddha-fieldsAnd thorough maturation of sentient beings,And brings about revelation and transmissionOf knowledge which is complete in every aspect;These five are the special features of the effects.The Root T ext

For individuals wishing to cross the thresholdInto original non-conceptual wisdom,For any bodhisattva, Awakening Hero,Here is how to cultivate the mind.
46. By virtue of one’s ignorance of suchness
The “store of all seeds” of what is unreal, mere invention,Is the cause for two which do not exist to appear;And, with that as the base, there are grounds for diversification,Due to which the cause and effects as well,In spite of appearing, still do not exist.With that appearing, pure being does not appear;Through that not appearing, pure being indeed appears.Through such cultivation of mind, when properly done,The Bodhisattva steps across the brinkInto original non-conceptual wisdom.The Root T ext

47. Through focusing thus, mere awareness is focused on,
Through which there are no referents to focus on;
Through there being no referents that could be focused on,There is no such mere awareness to focus on;Through that not existing on which to focus, the vergeIs crossed into focusing free of this twofold division;
48. No split into two existing on which to focus,
This is original non-conceptual wisdom,Since this is what is defined with the utmost precisionAs that which involves no object, no focusing,No attributes on which to focus at all.
49. The penetration of levels through application
Should be known to entail the following four steps:Through intense application involving informed commitment,The stage where training is done through informed commitmentComprises the step of definitive verification.To connect with superior, first-hand realizationIs the first of the levels, the stage the precise is encountered.The Root T ext

MIPHAM RINPOCHE ’S GENERAL
INTRODUCTION  TO
Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata
To the one who has conquered the mountain,
perceived and perceiver,
With the vajra, original non-conceptual wisdom,Thus gaining the inconceivable wisdom body;To the T eacher Supreme, the Mighty Sage, I bow.
The Heir of the Victor, Manjushri, as well as The Regent –
The tenth-level Lord, the Invincible Maitreya –Hold the treasures of Dharma both vast and profound.The nails of their feet are the jewels I support as my crown.
That which will here be explained is the glorious shastra
Elucidating profound reality –Original non-conceptual wisdom, the heartOf Mahayana dharma’s abundance of treasures.

60 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
That Heir of the Victor, the noble Asanga, performed the practice of
the beloved master of loving kindness, Maitreya, for what – measuredin human time would be – twelve years, at the end of which he beheldhim face to face. As a result he was transported to the Joyous God-realm, T ushita, where he was presented with five works which includethe two Ornaments, the two Distinctions, and The Uttaratantra ,
1 which
are treatises serving as commentaries on the purport of the teaching ofthe Victor in its entirety.
There are some scholars who consider all five as constituting a
single co-ordinated treatise, while others refute this assertion on thegrounds of the disagreement in their presentation of the ultimate onsuch points as there being one or three vehicles  from the perspective of
the definitive meaning .
Our own tradition considers them to be commentaries on the
intent of the separate levels of the teaching, taking the first [ The
Ornament of Clear Realization ] and last [ The Uttaratantra ] as
commentaries on the thought of the Madhyamaka , the middle three
[The Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras , Distinguishing the Middle from
the Extremes  and Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata ] on that of the
Cittamatra .
There are also some who consider The Ornament of Mahayana
Sutras alone to be a work of the Cittamatra, the other four to be
Madhyamaka texts. There are some who consider The Ornament of
Clear Realization  to be Madhyamaka and the other four Cittamatra;
still others who locate all five within the thinking of the Cittamatra;and others who consider all five to belong within the thought of theMadhyamaka, and so on.
What can nevertheless be indisputably established is that The
Ornament of Clear Realization  is a commentary on the Prajnaparamita
in the context of the middle level of the teaching; and that The
Uttaratantra  is a commentary on the sutras presenting the Buddha-
essence, which belongs to the definitive meaning associated with thefinal turning;
2 and that both of these texts propose but one family3
and one vehicle ultimately, which is in accord with the thinking of theMadhyamaka.
61
The Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras differs from the above two
mentioned texts with respect to the sutra topics it explains. It is acommentary which compiles into one volume the topics of the majorityof the sutras. On the whole, such factors as its lacking a decisivepresentation of the single family and vehicle clearly indicate this text isprimarily a commentary on the thought of the sutras associated withthe Cittamatra.
The two Distinctions [ Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata  and
Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes ] teach the vast as well as
the profound dimensions of the [Mahayana] vehicle in general. Eventhough these [two texts] extensively teach the three natures
4 and the
sense in which outer objects do not exist, this in itself does not restrictthem to being works of the Cittamatra alone. Thinking of theMadhyamaka could also be interpreted in terms of such dharmaterminology without incurring a contradiction. In the Lankavatara
sutra such terms are taught as general headings applicable to the wholeof the Mahayana path, as follows:
The five prevailing themes
5 and natures three,
Along with the eight-fold collection of consciousnessAnd the pith in the two forms of lack of self-entity –Throughout the Mahayana these are found.
This is also explicitly illustrated by The Sutra Requested by Maitreya
which clarifies the intent of the “Mother,”
6 [and therefore a
Madhyamaka text] where such dharma terms as “the three essentials(natures)” and so on are taught without there being a single categoricalstatement or logical argument which would necessarily amount toasserting true existence for the consciousness empty of dualism as thisis asserted in the works of the Cittamatra.
7 There is therefore no error
whatsoever in classifying [the two Distinctions] as commentaries whichdo not fall into any specific school of the [Mahayana], but apply tothe whole vehicle in general.
Moreover, precisely because they follow the style exhibited by such
major works, Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes  is a work
teaching the vast aspect, (meaning the stages of the paths of all threeMipham Rinpoche’s Introduction
62 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
vehicles) and Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata  is a work which,
commensurate with the way in which the Yogacarya-Madhyamaka8
unites the two truths , conclusively portrays the very heart of the theme
found in all sutra collections treating of the profound, namely, non-conceptual original wisdom.
It is precisely for this reason, and due to their extraordinary
profundity, that the manuscripts of this present work and of The
Uttaratantra  were bound with a seal of secrecy during the Indian period
and later in that period disappeared from circulation. It was at thattime that the mighty lord Maitripa, on discovering light emergingfrom a crack in a stupa , extracted the manuscripts of Distinguishing
Dharma and Dharmata and The Uttaratantra  and disseminated them
anew. Therefore, while Shama Lotsawa Senge Gyaltsen was studyingDistinguishing Dharma and Dharmata  and preparing his translation
of it, his learned teacher emphasized its significance by giving himonly one page at a time with the admonition, “Beware that no harmbefalls this! It is a text which is rarely available, because it is boundwith a seal. Its disappearance would be tantamount to the body of thebeloved master of loving kindness, Maitreya, passing from this worldinto nirvana .”
Since what it teaches is profound reality, which is the critical secret
embodied within the view, and because the realization of such a viewis required of all practitioners of the Mahayana, there is no incongruityin interpreting it from the perspective of either the Madhyamaka orthe Cittamatra systems. Nevertheless, even given that such texts as thePrajnaparamita sutras are interpreted in the works of individualCittamatra and Madhyamaka preceptors in accordance with theirrespective schools, their ultimate purport rests with the Madhyamaka.Similarly, even though there are scholars in whose treatises also thispresent work is interpreted according to the Cittamatra, since this isrelevant to a specific level of mental development, there is nocontradiction in explaining it. Nevertheless, it is in fact a work whichclearly portrays the character of nothing less than non-conceptualoriginal wisdom, the point of the utmost profundity within theMahayana, for which reason it serves as a commentary applicable ingeneral to any sutra treating of the profound.
63
Since it accords with the Cittamatra in the form its assertions take
with respect to the phenomenal world, which constitutes apparentreality, and since it accords with the Madhyamaka in its interpretationof dharmata, which constitutes genuine reality, it demonstrates thekey points of the Mahayana view by uniting the Cittamatra and theMadhyamaka, while its ultimate purport rests with the Madhyamaka.To understand and explain it in this way covers the entire range ofimplication afforded by this great treatise.Mipham Rinpoche’s Introduction

or shastra  was given by the Regent of the Victorious One, Maitreya
and is known as one of The Five Treatises of Maitreya . These treatises
by Maitreya are important Buddhist texts of the Middle-way  (Skt.
Madhyamaka ) and learned scholars of India and Tibet have debated
the meaning of these texts in great detail and at length.

66 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
How This T ext Was Written9
There is a Tibetan scholar named Kanga Tsultrim who wrote a book
in which he argued that this text did not come from the BuddhaMaitreya but by a human being whose name was Maitreyanatha andthat Asanga received this text from him. My own opinion is simplythat this person is overly involved with logic and has no confidence indharma and no confidence in the existence of the pure realm of T ushitawhere Asanga received Maitreya’s teachings. So he wrote this from thepoint of view of having little faith and confidence in the dharma.However, Maitreya did give these texts directly to Asanga. He taughtthem explicitly and that is well known to a great many panditas  and
siddhas  who have also received such a direct transmission of
knowledge.
10 In fact, Asanga went to the heaven of T ushita and received
this text from Maitreya.
At the time of Asanga, the principal place for the study of the
dharma in India was the Nalanda monastic university. A short timeprevious to Asanga’s birth a great fire had broken out at Nalanda anddestroyed many books, in particular, the texts of the Abhidharma . It
was not possible to repair that damage right away so a nun calledTsawai Tsultrim thought, “I won’t be able to refurbish and spread thisteaching by myself. I could, however, give up the nun’s life and givebirth to sons who would be able to study these teachings, that wouldallow for the restoration of the Abhidharma teachings.” She did soand gave birth to two sons: Asanga, whose father came from royalty,and Vasubhandu, whose father came from the Brahmin cast. Thesebrothers spread the Buddhist teaching widely and, in particular, theteachings of the Abhidharma .
According to the tradition of the time, a son took up the work
that his father had done. So at a certain point, the two sons of theformer nun Tsawai Tsultrim asked her, “Who are our fathers? Whatwork do they do? We want to prepare for the work that our fathersdo.” The mother replied to them, “Taking up the livelihood of yourfather is not the purpose of your being here, rather the purpose foryour being here is to train in the Abhidharma teachings. A great dealof harm has come to these teachings and they have been damaged
67
and have practically disappeared. So that they won’t disappear
completely, you need to study and teach them. That is the reasonwhy you are here.”
The younger son, Vasubhandu, went to study with a Kashmiri
teacher called Gendün Tsabmo and received the teachings on theAbhidharma of the lesser vehicle or the Hinayana , which is often now
called the Theravada tradition.
11  There is also the greater vehicle or
Mahayana and the views and teachings of the Mahayana go furtherthan the Hinayana. For that reason, the elder son, Asanga, practicedmeditation diligently trying to meet Maitreya so that he would be ableto spread these very profound teachings of the Mahayana. EventuallyAsanga was able to meet Maitreya and returned to the central countryand spread the teachings there.
So the two sons did what their mother had requested of them.
Asanga went into retreat and practiced for twelve years to achieve adirect transmission from Maitreya. During these twelve years he
endured much hardship. On several occasions he became discouragedand lost confidence and broke his retreat only to return to it again.However, arousing his confidence and courage again, he was able tocontinue his practice for twelve years and at the end he met face-to-face with the Maitreya Buddha. He then went to T ushita with Maitreyaand there listened to the oral instructions of the Maitreya Buddha.From listening to these oral instructions, Asanga received what areknown as The Five Works or Treatises of Maitreya . This text known as
Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata is one of these five texts.
Mahamudra
Generally speaking, Tibet is renowned throughout the world as being
the home of the secret  mantra  Vajrayana
12 teachings. However, not
only was the Vajrayana taught in Tibet, but the Mahayana dharma wasalso studied and practiced. With the Vajrayana being widely practicedin Tibet, meditation was also practiced. With regard to meditation,there are the particular traditions, the views and practices of Mahamudra
or the “great symbol” and Dzogchen  or “great completeness.” However,
what is the basis from which such dharma arose? It is the sutras or theIntroduction to the T ext
68 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
teachings of the Buddha and the shastras  or the commentaries that
were composed in India by the great scholars and accomplished persons.In order to achieve this very high view of Mahamudra and Dzogchen,we need to cut our own doubt in order to eliminate hindrances offalling into various sorts of errors or aberrations. What helps ineliminating our doubt, hindrances, and errors is to listen to andcontemplate the Mahayana dharma.
However, just studying and contemplating the dharma of the
Mahayana is not enough. We need the experience of meditation totruly realize this dharma. Also we need to achieve the fruit quickly. Inorder to accomplish such experience and realization, and to do soquickly, we require the oral instructions of Mahamudra or Dzogchen.Without these it is impossible to achieve the profound experience andthe completion of Mahamudra in a rapid manner. Therefore, anintroduction to Mahamudra or Dzogchen is of great importance.
The Shastras
When it came to practice in Tibet, the practice of the panditas and
adepts was that of the secret mantra Vajrayana. However, the teachingsthey heard and thought about were those of the Mahayana. Therefore,we need to listen to and contemplate the Mahayana teachings. In termsof what the Buddha-dharma comprises, it is twofold: there are theactual words spoken directly by the Buddha, which are recorded in thesutras, and there are the commentaries called shastras that werecomposed by the scholars on the meaning of these sutras. Of thesetwo, the treatises or shastras are more important. There are many whofeel that the way in which the Tibetan tradition has taken the shastrasto be more important is a mistake. They say, “The root of the Buddha’stradition is the Buddha himself and therefore one ought to take hiswords (the sutras) to be the main material to be studied.”
The reason the commentaries are of greater importance than the
sutras is that the Buddha presented the teachings like this: A studentwould come to him and ask a question and the Buddha would give areply. Some pupils came to the Buddha with faith, devotion,intelligence, the desire to practice, and asked their questions from that
69
point of view. Others had little faith, devotion or great yearning for
the dharma and would ask questions and the Buddha would givedifferent answers to these students according to their attitude ordisposition. Thus, with the Buddha’s speech there is the definitiveteachings (Tib. ngedön ) and there are the provisional teachings  or
teachings that would require interpretation (Tib. drangdon ). If the
Buddha were to give those without much faith and devotion thedefinitive teachings, they wouldn’t have confidence in it. So, the Buddhagave them something else to think about; rather than giving them theactual or definitive teaching he gave them the provisional teachings.
So, if we were to read the sutras directly, we would make the mistake
of taking a definitive teaching for being a provisional teaching or oftaking a provisional teaching for being a definitive teaching. We wouldnot know how to sort them out and figure out which one is which.Fortunately, after the Buddha’s presentation of the dharma, manyscholars with their own higher intelligence (Skt. prajna ), their own
experience, understood which from among the teachings were thedefinitive teachings and which were the provisional teachings. Theywrote treatises differentiating the definitive from the provisionalteachings. This is the reason why the shastras are more important,than the sutras.
Among the shastras or treatises, there are two types: the shastras
themselves and the oral instructions. The shastras themselves approachvarious topics through reasoning and explain in detail and with greatclarity topics such as the five aggregates (Skt. skandhas ), the twelve
sense fields (Skt. ayatana ) and the eighteen elements (Skt. dhatu ). These
topics are principally presented in long analytical treatises. The oral
instructions  (Tib. dag nag ) tell us how to practice by presenting
instructions in a very brief way. Of these two, the shastras and the oralinstructions, the oral instructions are more important.
Among the five treatises of Maitreya, four books are classed as
shastras proper and one falls into the class of oral instructions. Thefour that are shastras are very extensive. They are Ornament of Clear
Realization  (Skt. Abhisamayalankara ), the Ornament of the Mahayana
Sutras  (Skt. Mahayanasutralankara ), Distinguishing the Middle from the
Extremes  (Skt. Madhyantavibhaga ) and The Changeless Nature  (Skt.Introduction to the T ext
70 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
Uttaratantra ). The present text Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata
is very brief and direct in its presentation and is included within theclass of oral instructions. Thus, for those who have faith and are exertingthemselves in practice, the oral instructions are more important thanthe shastras.
How is it that Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata  is an oral
instruction? Generally speaking, in mediation there is, as mentioned,Mahamudra and Dzogchen and within meditation there is the practiceof Shamatha  and Vipashyana . Between these two, in the context of
Mahamudra and Dzogchen, it is Vipashyana or insight meditationthat is mainly practiced. This is because we are introduced to the truenature (Tib. nge lug ) of the mind. In Mahamudra and Dzogchen, by
examining the mind directly we abandon the disturbing emotions and
reach Buddhahood. In the sutra teachings, this profound nature isspoken of as dharmata or “nature of phenomena.” In the context ofmantra, it is called sem (“mind-nature”).
It is just this nature of phenomena or mind’s nature that is to be
known. We must understand this through hearing and thinking aboutit. Nevertheless, ordinary people are not able to realize it directly. Whatis the reason for that? We are obstructed by conventional appearances.Due to conventional appearances we are not able to realize the dharma-nature or mind-nature. If we are able to realize this profound nature,then we will naturally separate from these confused, concealing orconventional sorts of appearances. Thus, this text, Distinguishing
Dharma and Dharmata,  is devoted to identifying and distinguishing
just exactly what the conventional appearances or conventional truths
are, and just exactly what the ultimate truth  (the nature of phenomena
or the ultimate enduring condition)
13 is. So, this treatise is extremely
important for those who wish to practice the meditations ofMahamudra and Dzogchen.
This treatise, Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata,  was composed
many generations ago. For that reason, if someone just picks it up andtries to understand it, it can be difficult to understand. After all, it israther dissimilar from the kinds of books that we are familiar with inthe present time and this makes it difficult to understand. However,given that a very great bodhisattva presented the teaching, it is not
71
incomprehensible and there is great benefit from having understood
it. So, if we put forward exertion and approach it with longing andrespect, then we can indeed understand it. In particular, those inWestern countries have trained from a very young age in a variety ofstudies and have developed their intelligence and ability to reason well.Therefore, you will be able to understand this text clearly. Havingunderstood it clearly and having developed confidence in what youhave understood, if you then bring that into the practice of meditation,it will be of great benefit.
Understanding this text will be beneficial to those who have not
yet given birth to meditation by arousing a desire to meditate. Forthose who have already given birth to meditation, it will help to givecertainty, confidence, knowledge and stability in the meditation. Forthose who already have these qualities, it will allow these qualities toincrease. Therefore, from whatever point of view you approach thisteaching, it will be beneficial and extremely important.
B. T HE HOMAGE
1.b. To the guardian Maitreya we bow in supplication.
In the past the homage to shastras would be to the Buddhas and
bodhisattvas. If the text concerned the Vinaya  or monastic discipline
it would say, “I prostrate to the Omniscient One.” With textsconcerning the Abhidharma the homage would say, “I prostrate to theyouthful Manjushri.” However, later translators departed from thistradition, and on this particular occasion the homage is to Maitreya.
The expression of the homage is also related to the time in which
this text was translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan. Although all fiveof the treatises of Maitreya appeared in the world at the same time(Asanga dates are the fourth century C.E.), Distinguishing Dharma
and Dharmata , the root text of The Uttaratantra  and the commentary
on The Uttaratantra  composed by Asanga were concealed as treasures
(Tib. terma ). This was because their meaning was very profound and
it was felt that these texts were not entirely suitable for the times. Later,Introduction to the T ext
72 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
Maitripa, who lived at about the same time as the great master Naropa
(roughly the year 1000 C.E.), saw light issuing forth from a crack in astupa. From that light he saw that there was something very specialinside, and he pulled out these three texts. So, these three texts wererevealed by Maitripa and were thus widely disseminated in the world.These texts were brought to Tibet and were translated into Tibetanlater than the earlier texts of Maitreya had been translated. So thehomage is different from what is found in the translations of the othertexts of Maitreya.
C. W HY THIS TEXT WAS WRITTEN
2. Something there is to be given up fully through knowingAnd something else which can only be actualized,Because of which this treatise has been composedWith the wish to distinguish the traits defining these.
Maitreya gives the reason for composing this text by saying, basically,
that we must understand what is called “that which possesses thequality.” The quality to which this refers is the dharmata itself. It istranslated as “phenomena” but it means that which bears the qualityof dharmata. One must understand phenomena and also the dharmata.The phenomena themselves are samsaric, confused appearance orsamsaric confusion. They need to be abandoned. What is the methodfor abandoning such phenomena? It is through recognizing andunderstanding the enduring condition, the true nature, or the way inwhich phenomena truly exist (Tib. nge lug ). That must be known
manifestly. Thus, it is for the purpose of abandoning confusion andrealizing the non-confused state that this treatise has been composed.
We must understand the distinctive character of confused
appearances and we must also understand the nature, the character,the conditions and the excellent qualities of dharmata. T o do this,Maitreya gives this as the reason for having written his treatise by saying,“Because of which this treatise has been composed.”

Questions
Question : I don’t understand what the words dharma and dharmata
mean.Rinpoche : If the word dharma were to be translated directly out of
Sanskrit into Tibetan, then it would be translated into Tibetan withthe word zin po , which means “to hold.” The notion is to prevent one
from falling down; it holds one up. As for the word that the translatorssettled upon for translating dharma, the word chö actually means, “to
fix something,” “to repair something.”
14 One has various faults and
the notion is that chö is what repairs them. We talk about the qualityof the seed or the cause of samsara: it is the three poisons, which aredesire, hatred and ignorance. The function or role of chö or dharma isto fix or repair or heal those particular problems. Is it possible to doso? Is it possible to fix up, clear away or eliminate the hindrances,suffering, impediments and so forth? Yes, it is indeed possible to doso. It is possible to abandon desire, hatred and ignorance. How is suchpossible? We have at this point the various sorts of confusion ormistaken appearances. However, it is our good fortune that we canunderstand that these are in fact not true, that mistaken appearancesand confusion are not the truth of the matter. We can know that, wecan understand that, we can realize that. In fact, we can realize theactual nature, the true nature, the enduring condition of things. It isin that context that one speaks of dharmata, the true nature of things.
Question : The five treatises of Maitreya are divided into the Mind-
only (Cittamatra) and Madhyamaka schools. Where does this text fitin and what is the characteristic to put it into that category?Rinpoche : There are many different ways of explaining the five treatises
of Maitreya in terms of the various philosophical schools in the IndianBuddhist tradition. Some say that all five books are texts of the Mind-only school. Some say that The Ornament of Clear Realization  is a text
of the Middle-way or Madhyamaka school and that the other four aretexts of the Mind-only or Cittamatra school. Some say that The
Ornament of Clear Realization  and The Uttaratantra  are texts of the
Middle-way (Skt. Madhyamaka) school and that the other three areIntroduction to the T ext
74 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
texts of the Mind-only (Skt. Cittamatra) school. So, there are a great
many ways of talking about this. However, in terms of joining this tomeditation and practice, it is necessary to settle appearances, to resolvethat appearances are just mind and that mind itself is empty and torealize emptiness in meditation. Even if one’s view is that of theMadhyamaka school, it is nevertheless necessary to settle suchappearances as being just mind. If one were then to say that this mind,that this stuff of these appearances were truly existent or trulyestablished, then that would be the view of the Cittamatra school.However, there isn’t any place in the five treatises of Maitreya where itis said that this mind, having settled that all appearances are just mind– that then says that this mind is truly existent or truly established.Thus, from that point of view it can be said that all of them are texts ofthe Middle-way school and in particular, from among them, The
Uttaratantra  and this text, Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata ,
present the view of the Shentong  or Empty-of-other school in that they
teach the sugatagarbha , “the essence of the one gone to bliss.”
My experience in talking about the dharma with people, in giving
presentations and explanations on topics of the dharma, is thatsometimes I am able to answer people’s questions adequately andsometimes I am not. Sometimes I can help to clear away people’s doubtsabout things and sometimes I am not able to do so. So, when you askquestions and if I am able to answer them properly, I will do so to thebest of my ability and if I am not able to answer them properly, then Iwill just have to say, “Well, I’m sorry. I just don’t know right now.” Forthat reason we could extend the discussions a little bit and bring upwhatever questions you have. Sometimes people think that becausethey have a tough and hard question, it wouldn’t be suitable to ask.They think, “I shouldn’t ask because it is a very tough question.” That’snot true. If you have a tough question, then please ask it and I willanswer as best as I can. Some people think that because they have atiny question that they should not ask it. They think, “I shouldn’t askbecause it is such a silly question.” That’s not true either. Whateverquestions you have, please ask them and I will answer them as best asI can. I will tell you whatever I know.
75
Question : I would like to know how Maitripa got the mind teaching
from this?Rinpoche : What Maitripa found was an actual book, a text. It was
neither something offered to him by the dakinis nor was it a mind
treasure. Between sutra and mantra, at this point we are discussing theview taught within the tradition of sutra and therefore the uncommon,miraculous displays of the mantra tradition do not come into play.Maitripa discovered these texts by way of direct knowledge orclairvoyance and by way of having a karmic relationship with it, justbecause he was a very fortunate person.Introduction to the T ext

CHAPTER  TWO
A Brief Presentation of the Text
II. T HE BRIEF PRESENTATION  OF THE TEXT
A. T HE DEFINITION  OF DHARMA  (PHENOMENA )
AND DHARMATA  (PURE BEING)
3. A summary of everything in brief
Should be known to include the following two motifs,Since everything can be summarized fully in termsOf phenomena and likewise pure being.
4. That which is classified here as phenomena
Is samsara; that which is classified preciselyAs pure being is nirvana, transcendence of grief,As this is defined by the vehicles, which are three.
This treatise introduces a topic by giving a brief overview of the
subject and then it gives a more detailed description of the same
topic. We begin in this chapter with the brief overview and then give

78 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
the detailed characteristics of dharma, which is our conventional
perception of the world we live in, follwed by dharmata.
Addressing the topic of dharma and dharmata is extremely vast,
with the word “dharma” meaning “phenomena” but in this text it refersto all confused samsaric appearances. The word “dharmata” also means“phenomena,” but it also refers to the nature of all of these phenomena,which is how they truly are.
15 Therefore, there is nothing that is not
included within these two: dharma and dharmata. On the one hand,dharma refers to all worldly, samsaric appearances, to the way thatthings appear, and dharmata refers to the way in which they actuallyare or abide. Therefore, if we can realize both the manner of appearanceand the manner of abiding, we have realized everything.
Some scholars have illustrated how things appear and how they
actually abide by using an example of a rope that is mistaken for asnake. If we see a rope in a dark room and believe that this rope is asnake, we then become frightened and confused, thinking, “It willbite me and if it bites me, then I may die. I am in a lot of trouble.”However, there is no need to be afraid because there isn’t really a snakethere. Nevertheless, thinking that there is a snake, we become frightenedand we suffer. So what would be the method for helping relieve thesuffering in this particular instance? We might look for a weapon oran antidote for snakebite. But, in fact, those solutions don’t help at allbecause the solution is to simply realize that it is not a snake. If weunderstand that it is not a snake but a rope, then we will no longer beafraid, we will no longer suffer, and all those problems will be solved.
Similarly, in cyclic existence (Skt. samsara ), which is dharma, we
sometimes experience suffering and other times joy. We may experiencebodily suffering of illness or experience the mental suffering ofunhappiness. Whatever our experience, there is always the suffering ofimpermanence.
16 We might think that the proper method to eliminate
such suffering is to eliminate impermanence. However, that is not thebest way to go about it. The best way to go about eliminating thesuffering of samsara is to understand that these phenomena are notsolid and real in their own nature; they do not exist inherently.
How then do we understand the way in which phenomena actually
exist? It is through realizing dharmata, the way in which phenomena
79
actually abide. What we mean by dharmata is the nirvana of the three
vehicles (the Hinayana, the Mahayana, and the Vajrayana). The Tibetanword for “nirvana” is literally “passed beyond suffering.”
17 Realizing
dharmata, we understand the true manner of abiding of things orphenomena and that is the method for clearing away the suffering ofsamsara. That is like realizing that a rope is not a snake.
B. T HE CHARACTERISTICS  OF DHARMA  AND DHARMATA
1. T HE CHARACTERISTICS  OF DHARMA
5. Here the traits of phenomena are definedAs duality plus assumption and formulation,Whose appearance is the mistaken conceptual process;Since what appears is not and is thus not real.No referents have ever existed eitherAnd, being but concept, consist of conceptualization.
Dharmas are phenomena, the various apparent phenomena and
confused appearances of samsara, which bring with them a greatdeal of difficulty and hardship. However, we are extremely fortunatebecause the manner of appearance of such phenomena are confusedand can therefore be abandoned. Because such samsaric appearancesare mistaken, are not true, we can realize dharmata. By realizingdharmata it is possible to abandon the problems, hardships, andsuffering of samsara.
18
There are three definitive characteristics of samsaric phenomena:
“duality, assumption and formulation.” First is the aspect of theperceived and the perceiver as being separate, dualistic appearances(duality). Then, in relation to such, what appears to one’s mind, theimaginary dualistic phenomena as actually existing (assumption),accompanied by various sorts of verbal expressions (formulation). Thismakes up what we mean by the Tibetan term chö jin  or “phenomena,”
which are conventional truths (Tib. kunzop denpa ).A Brief Presentation of the T ext
80 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
We see such conventional truths; however, they do not exist the
way that we perceive them. Their appearance is not correct. Rather,these phenomena are just our own mental activity of what is called“mind only” (Tib. sem tsam ). There are in fact no objects; there is just
this mental activity. This refers to conceptual activity and non-conceptual sense-consciousness. What is being said is that it is not anappearance of objects; it is just mental activity.
19
The Four Schools of Buddhism
In terms of resolving the view, the Buddha taught in stages. So in
accordance with that, various philosophical schools or tenets have comeabout. There are in particular four major schools. The first is theVaibhashika  school or Great-exposition or Particularist school, which
is associated with the shravakas . The second is Sautrantika  or Sutra
school. The third is the Cittamatra or Mind-only school. The fourthschool is known as the Madhyamaka or Middle-way school.
20 The
Buddha taught the philosophical view in these stages and if we proceedin these stages, we can understand that appearances are just mind andthat mind itself has no inherent existence.
Buddha said that our mode of procedure towards the view is like
going up a staircase; we have to go up the first step, then the secondstep, and then the third step and so on. If we were to try to jump fromthe bottom of the staircase to the top, that would not be possible.Similarly, if we were to say to beginners, “All things are just emptiness,”they wouldn’t be able to realize it or develop any conviction of thatstatement. If we were to say to beginners, “The Buddha’s wisdom dwellsin all sentient beings” or “All appearances are just of the nature ofmind,” they wouldn’t understand it, they wouldn’t be able to realize itquickly, and they wouldn’t develop a conviction of its truth rapidly.Therefore, the Buddha taught in a different way. First he taught aboutthe skandhas or aggregates, indicating that a person is a collection ofmany different parts, that external phenomena are also collections ofmany different things, they are not single, solid objects. Externalappearances, then, are just a collection of many very tiny small particlesthat we could call “atoms.” As for internal apprehending consciousness,
81
it is a collection of indivisible moments of mind.21 This is the view of
the first school, the Vaibhashikas, who say that the minute partlessparticles and irreducible moments of mind are truly existent and it isthrough a collection of such inseparable particles or a continuum ofsuch irreducible moments of mind that the gross phenomena that weordinarily apprehend come about. It is only through a continuumthat, for instance, something such as a year or a month comes about.There is no large, hard thing that exists in the way in which thingsordinarily appear.
The Sautrantika school differentiates between 1) what is a mere
abstraction; what has only general characteristics, objects of ourthoughts or abstract images that we can construct conceptually, and 2)what is a specifically characterized thing; something that has its ownunique characteristics, an actual thing that appears before us that’sthere whether we think about it or not. For example, when we think“fire,” the fire we’re thinking about can’t burn anything, it doesn’t doanything, it cannot perform the function of burning. What actuallydoes something is the actual thing that is there beyond our names andconcepts, that to which we give the name fire; it has its own totallyunique characteristics unlike anything else. It is a unique object and itis performing the function of being hot and burning whether we thinkit burns us or not. That’s what the Sautrantika school says; that there isan object there that really does exist beyond our concepts about what itis, and that the concepts are mere fabrications that don’t really exist. TheSautrantikas also say that external, material phenomena have the natureof being established as particles, which are the cause of appearances.
If you look then at the specifically characterized object itself, it
doesn’t have any name, it doesn’t have any conceptually fabricatedcharacteristics at all. It is its own unique entity and what that is, iscompletely indescribable and inconceivable. Our own mentalexperiences are precisely the same. When we feel happy or we feeldown then we give it those labels but if you really examine theexperience, it’s inexpressible. It can’t be named or labeled by anyconceptual term and that in the Sautrantika school is evidence of aspecifically characterized thing. Therefore the inexpressible, specificallycharacterized thing truly exists, according to the Sautrantikas.A Brief Presentation of the T ext
82 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
There are various differences between the Vaibhashika school and
the Sautrantikas, but in terms of their view, it is basically the same.Both hold that apparent and gross phenomena are, in fact, merelycollections of truly existent partless particles and truly existentirreducible moments of mind. The important point of these views isthat ordinarily we apprehend coarse or gross phenomena and theseviewpoints show this is a great mistake. If we are able to realize thatphenomena are not the massive, solid things that they appear to be,then that is the first step on the staircase.
If you are able to understand these particular presentations, to
meditate upon them, and to truly realize them, then you will abandona great many faults and achieve a great many good qualities. However,you must go further than that. A further step on the staircase is tounderstand that all appearances are just mind, and this was emphasizedby the third school, the Mind-only school. The Buddha himself saidthat phenomena are just mind
22 and this was explained clearly and in
detail by various learned scholars who made this argument in terms oftwo logical arguments. The first is a negation or refutation of externalphenomena. The second is a demonstration that external phenomenaare, in fact, internal mind.
Why External Phenomena are Empty
In the first analysis or first step we understood that what appears to be
coarse, external phenomena are really just a collection of very tiny,subtle particles gathered together. If we pursue that sort of analysis, wewould have to come to the point of saying that the tiny particlesthemselves are not composed of parts; that they are irreducible orindivisible phenomena. However, if we investigate this claim carefully,we discover that there is no such thing as a smallest indivisible particle.We could hypothesize the existence of indivisible particles, but, infact, there is no such thing. Therefore, the way in which such massiveand gross phenomena come about is not through the collection of agreat many very tiny particles, rather it is just the coming about throughappearing for our own internal mind.
23
83
Why External Phenomena are Mind
There are two logical reasons often used to explain why external
phenomena are, in fact, just appearances of the mind, luminousknowledge and dependent arising. Here I will explain the first,“luminous knowledge.” If we consider various external phenomenasuch as a mountain or a chair or a thimble, we feel that the objectexists. We do this because we can see it. It is merely the seeing ofsomething that leads us to feel, think, and believe that it exists. However,there is no other way to establish or to prove the existence of something.For instance, if we think that a particular mountain exists, we say,“Well, I saw it and that’s why I think it exists.” If we ask someone else,“Why do you think that such a thing exists?” All they can answer is,“Well, I saw it. That’s all.” It’s just an appearance for our mind. Considerthe stupa outside this monastery. We think it exists. Why do we thinkthat it exists? We believe this because we see it. We see it because itappears to our mind. But there is no way to demonstrate the existenceof something that has not appeared to our mind. There is no way todemonstrate the existence of something without its appearing to mind.Therefore, external phenomena and internal mind are inseparable.
Similarly, if we hear a sound, we think that the sound exists. Why
do we think that sound exists? “Because I heard it,” is our answer. Isthere an unheard sound? No, there isn’t. Thus, whether we talk aboutvisible images, sounds that are apprehended by our ear, smellsapprehended by our nose, or various tastes that are tasted by our tongue,it is only because of their appearing to our mind that we think thatthey exist. Thus, external things are just internal mind. Therefore, theseexternal appearances are just our internal mind. They are not trulyestablished as what they appear to be. The main point at this junctureis that appearances are just appearances for mind.

When we distinguish the Middle-way (Skt. Madhyamaka ) school
– the next step on the ladder – from the Mind-only (Skt. Cittamatra )
school, we say that the view of the Mind-only school is lower than thatof the Middle-way school.
25 The reason is that the Mind-only school
believes that while all appearances are mind, the mind itself truly exists.So, from that consideration, the view of the Mind-only school is inferiorA Brief Presentation of the T ext
84 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
to the Middle-way school. Nevertheless, the view set forth in the context
of the Mind-only school is very important because it is able to settleprecisely that appearances are just mind. There is an important practicalpurpose for establishing this fact. For instance, when we practiceMahamudra or Dzogchen meditation, we need to realize the mind asit really is. But if we have not understood that external appearances areactually just our mind, then realizing the mind’s way of existing is notof any great benefit. Therefore, the arguments presented by the Mind-only school, that external phenomena are just mind, is of greatimportance and benefit.
The demonstration that external phenomena are just the mind
is very important in the practice of Mahamudra and Dzogchenmeditation. In fact, it is the root of all meditation; it is extremelyhelpful for all meditation because it allows us to see the greatimportance of mind. If mind were not itself important, thenmeditation on mind would not be particularly important or helpful.It is like mistaking a rope for a snake. If it really was a snake and wethought, “It’s not a snake. It’s a rope,” then no matter how much wethought it wasn’t a snake when it bites us it would not be of muchgood. Similarly, the fact that external appearances are really just ourmind means that there is a great value and benefit to understandingthe mind’s true way of existing.
2. T HE CHARACTERISTICS  OF DHARMATA
6.The other factor, pure being, is definedAs suchness, in which there is no differentiationBetween a factor perceived and a perceiver,A signifier contra a signified.
In the previous verse discussing dharma, we saw that the various
mistaken appearances of samsara seem to be external phenomena, butthat they are not actually external things, but merely appearances tomind. As for mind itself, if external things actually existed as solidoutside objects, then there would be internal consciousnesses that
85
validly and accurately apprehend these phenomena as external. For
instance, if there were actually some patch of blue existing externally,then there would be an internal consciousness apprehending that patchof blue accurately as an external phenomenon. If, on the other hand,there is no such thing as an external color blue, then there is no internalconsciousness apprehending it as such. If we apply this more vastly,the same is true with regard to forms, sounds, and everything else. Inthis way, if the phenomena that seem to be external and that areapprehended by consciousness are, in fact, not external phenomena,then similarly the internal consciousness is not valid.
In that way, the lack of solid external phenomena indicates similarly
the lack of valid establishment of internal consciousnesses thatapprehend external phenomena. Furthermore, this applies to the wordsthat are used to express and name various phenomena and it applies tothose phenomena that receive such names. As it says quite literally,“those which express” and “those which are expressed” or “the signifier”and “that which is signified.” So, the relationship between objects andwords is similarly shown to be one in which there is no differencebetween the two in the manner that there seems to be. In this way,from among the four major philosophical schools (the Vaibhashika,Sautrantika, Cittamatra and Madhyamaka) we are coming to the viewof the Middle-way or Madhyamaka school. This school holds that allphenomena (external phenomena and internal mind) lack inherentexistence and do not have any nature of their own.
26 In this way, the
conventional and ultimate status of phenomena is demonstrated.
C. T HE RATIONALE  FOR THIS DISTINCTION
7. Because what does not exist appears, delusionProvides the cause for completely afflicted states;Since things like illusory elephants appear,Even what does exist does not appear.
Clearly, there are appearances of visual forms, sounds, odors and so
forth that appear. Are these nothing whatsoever? No, phenomena doA Brief Presentation of the T ext
86 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
appear. But these appearances are of things which do not exist, they
are appearances of non-existing phenomenon. Because appearancesare based on non-existent phenomena, the appearances are false orincorrect. The true nature of phenomena is impermanent, but it appearsto be solid and unchanging and permanent. So in this regardphenomena are also false or mistaken. Since such appearances aremistaken or confused, they are the cause of disturbing emotions
27 (Skt.
kleshas ) which are called afflictions here. As the cause of afflictions,
they are the cause of suffering because disturbing emotions are whatcause our suffering in life.
28
Even though phenomena do not exist, nevertheless they do appear.
As Buddha says in the Heart Sutra,  “Form is emptiness”: i.e. forms
lack a nature of their own, they lack inherent existence. Does thatmean that forms are utterly non-existent? No, because it then says,“Emptiness is form”: i.e. emptiness itself appears as form. This is likethe way in which a magician may conjure up an illusion of an elephantor we might give the example of an elephant appearing in our dreamwhich really appears to us, but obviously there is no real elephant inthe room while we are dreaming. So, even though appearances do notexist, nevertheless they do appear. In just this way, appearances dawnon the conventional level.
8. If either the lack of existence or the appearance
Were missing, delusion and freedom from delusionAnd likewise states afflicted in every respectAnd thorough refinement would be unjustified.
Although they do not exist, various conventional phenomena do appear;
therefore they are just confusion. And since these appearances are justconfusion, it is possible to see through this confusion and achieveBuddhahood. In other words, it then is possible to realize the actualnature of phenomena and to meditate and achieve Buddhahood.
If, on the other hand, phenomena truly existed, then afflictions
and mistaken appearances would not be mistaken or false. If they trulyexisted as solid real objects, then there would be no impermanence orgradual change within appearance and then it would not be possible
87
to achieve nirvana or Buddhahood. If appearances were real, there
would be no realization of some correct nature that was opposite tothis mistaken appearance. If there were no realization of a true natureof phenomena, it would not be possible to achieve nirvana. Therefore,if phenomena were truly established, there would be neither samsaranor nirvana.
D. T
HE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN
DHARMA  AND DHARMATA
9. These two are not one and the same nor do they differ,
Because, between that which exists and that which does not,A distinction exists and yet does not exist.
The root text next discusses the relationship between dharma and
dharmata, asking whether they are one nature or different natures. Infact, they are neither one nature nor different natures.
First, we try to determine whether they are of the same nature.
They are not of the same nature because conventional appearances arenot inherently established; even though they appear in a certain way,they are not established in the way that they appear and therefore theyare false. Dharmata, on the other hand, is true. Since the one is falseand the other is true, they have a different character and are not of thesame nature.
Then, if dharma and dharmata are not of the same nature, are
they different? No, they are not different because dharmata is the merenon-existence of dharma. It is not some other “thing;” it is notsomething that exists somewhere else. It is not possible to have thesevarious confused appearances in one place and dharmata (which istheir way of existing) somewhere else and apart. Dharmata is the merenon-establishment of dharma in the way that dharmas seem to exist.Thus, these two, dharma and dharmata, are devoid of being either onenature or different natures.
Thus we have discussed the definitive characteristics of dharma
and dharmata and the matter of whether or not they are of the same orA Brief Presentation of the T ext
88 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
different natures. Other texts discuss the egolessness of persons  and the
egolessness of phenomena  in two points. However, it amounts to the
same thing; these two ways of approaching the matter come down tothe same meaning.
The Egolessness of the Individual
Generally speaking, Buddha taught the selflessness or egolessness of
persons (Tib. dag me ) in the Hinayana and the egolessness of
phenomena in the Mahayana. The Buddha presented the egolessnessof persons in the Hinayana for a particular reason. Sentient beingsdwelling in samsara experience a great deal of suffering and they mustunderstand this suffering in order to find release from suffering.However, the mere wish to abandon suffering is not sufficient. Rather,we need to understand the causes of suffering, which are karma andthe disturbing emotions. People have become quite used to the causesof suffering and have established strong predispositions for engagingin the causes of suffering. We might think, “I am going to abandonsuffering now. I am going to abandon hatred. I am going to abandonenvy. I am going to abandon desire.” In fact, it is not possible to simplydo this. We can abandon suffering only by abandoning the causes ofsuffering, which are the disturbing emotions. The cause of thedisturbing emotions is the belief in a self.
29
It is possible to abandon the conception of self.30 The Buddha
saw that the conception of self is a mistaken conception. If the selfactually existed, it would not be possible to abandon it. However, thisconception of self is false because, in fact, there is no self. We canarrive at this through analysis and reasoning and through a path ofmeditation. Once having understood the conception of self to be false,then it will naturally be overcome. For this reason, Buddha taught theperson’s lack of self first in the Hinayana.
There are a great many non-Buddhist traditions that do not take
this lack of a self into consideration. However, in Buddhism the lackof self is regarded as very important and is known as one of “the four
seals” that mark a doctrine as being the word of the Buddha. Selflessness
occupies a prominent place because by realizing selflessness, then an
89
unpeaceful mind can become peaceful and tamed. Therefore, the
recognition and realization of selflessness is regarded as extremelyimportant and is a distinctive feature of the Buddhist tradition.
There are two aspects for this conception of self: the conception
of “I” and the conception of “mine.” Of these two aspects of theconception of self the main erroneous belief is the perception of “I.”However, it is easier to discuss the conception of mine. We all have aconcept that certain things are “mine.” For instance, sometimes wethink, “my mind” and other times we think, “my body.” At that pointwe have broadened the conception of “mine” to include our entirebody. We can go on expanding this to include “my house” or “myland” or “my country.” At other times these things are regarded as “notbelonging to me,” but as “belonging to someone else” such as “thisisn’t my land.” There is l ittle stability to this concept of mine. For
instance, if we are talking about Tibetans and Tibet, however muchwe might think, “my country,” nevertheless we don’t have controlover it; it’s not ours.
The conception of mine is a source of difficulty, suffering and
hardship. We could consider an example that outside this monasterythere are a lot of stores selling vajras and bells. If we go into one shopwhere they sell a bell and we see a bell fall to the ground and break, wejust think, “Oh, a bell fell to the ground and broke.” However, if ourown bell falls to the ground and breaks, then that is very painful. Whyis there suffering in one example and no suffering in the other example?It simply leads back to whether or not we regard something as belongingto us or not. If we think that it is “mine,” then there is suffering; if wethink that this isn’t “mine,” then there is no suffering.
No matter how much we think of something as “mine,” this is a
false belief. Between the bell that fell on the floor in the store and ourown bell that broke, there is really no difference. There is nothinginside or outside the bell that particularly makes it our bell. It is simplyconfusion in our mind and such confusion leads to suffering. Then tobe free from such suffering, we have to realize that “mine” is reallynon-existent. Through understanding the lack of any inherent realityof mine, the power of our perception of mine becomes weaker. As thatconception becomes weaker, then our suffering decreases.A Brief Presentation of the T ext
90 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
The conception of “mine” focuses upon one object and then upon
another and thus the object of such a conception is extremely unstable.Similarly, the conception of “I” is unstable. Sometimes we think “I” inregard to our mind and sometimes we think “I” in regard to our body.When we are thinking “I” in regard to our mind, sometimes we thinkthis in regard to all six consciousnesses  and we sometimes think this only
in regard to the sixth mental consciousness . In this way, the conception
of “I” is also not stable. Also, our body is a collection of many differentmaterial substances gathered together and we cannot point to one partand say this part is “I.” Similarly, our mind is a collection of manydifferent moments of consciousnesses. It is not just one thing. It isonly through the collection of the sense of past, present and future,that we think “I” in regard to the continuum of the mind over a periodof time. However, whether we look into the past, the present or thefuture, we will not find any one thing as being a self. If we realize thislack of self, then our disturbing emotions of aggression, attachment,pride and jealousy will gradually diminish. So first, this lack of selfneeds to be known or understood; secondly, it must be meditated upon;and thirdly, it must be actually realized. When it has been realized,then the disturbing emotions will be abandoned.
The Selflessness of Dharmas (Phenomena)
The realization of the egolessness of self enables us to overcome the
conception of a self of persons, thereby pacifying the disturbingemotions (Skt. kleshas ). Next is the egolessness of dharma. The Sanskrit
word “dharma” and the Tibetan word chö mean many different things.
One use of the word “dharma” is for those things that are to be practiced,another is for various objects of knowledge. Here the word “dharma”is used for “all things” which we also call “phenomena.”
In the context of the egolessness of dharmas, the dharmas are objects
of knowledge, whether we are speaking about external phenomena(such as visible images and sounds) or internal phenomena (such asfeelings and thoughts). All of these objects of knowledge are called“dharma.” When we realize the person’s lack of self, then we begin toeliminate the cause of suffering. When we realize the lack of self of the
91
solidity of phenomena, then we can understand what suffering actually
is. We see that these causes of suffering have no nature of their own.Through understanding that, we see that they have no ability to harmus. In explaining the lack of inherent existence of phenomena, theBuddha taught their final character.
In the sutra tradition, the egolessness of phenomena is approached
by the path of reasoning. It is presented in the context of the Middle-way (Skt. Madhyamaka) school and Mind-only (Skt. Cittamatra)school. As discussed before, the Mind-only school postulates thatappearances are just mind. By recognizing that the appearancesthemselves are mistaken, we understand that the mind is also mistakenand thus the mind itself is no more inherently existent than thephenomena that appears to it. That is the way in which the egolessnessof phenomena is presented by the Mind-only school. The Middle-wayschool approaches the egolessness of phenomena through investigationof the cause, through effect, and then through the very entity ofphenomena: i.e. just what they are. In the sutra tradition of the Middle-way school, we proceed on a path of inference and arrive at what isknown as “ascertaining consciousness.” However, in the tradition ofthe Vajrayana we do not use the path of inference, but use the path ofmeditation. We meditate and this gives rise to experience; and throughthis we are introduced to the true nature of the mind.
31 In this
meditation, the egolessness of phenomena or dharmata appears and isunderstood and realized. Through realization of the egolessness ofphenomena (dharmata) we recognize phenomena as naturally (of theirown accord) peaceful, pleasant and liberated.
Questions
Question : Does the Vaibhashika school say that indivisible particles
and irreducible moments have the same nature?Rinpoche : Such is not held to be the case by the Vaibhashika school;
rather the one, the indivisible particles, are external phenomena; theyare material, atomic: whereas the irreducible moments of consciousnessare internal mind; they are luminous, clear awareness. These two areA Brief Presentation of the T ext
92 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
in the relationship of the object apprehended and the subject
apprehending the object.
Question : Do the indivisible particles have the nature of matter in the
way that we understand them in the West?Rinpoche : As explained earlier, Buddha presented both the definitive
meaning and the provisional meaning or a meaning that tends to leadone somewhere else. In Tibetan the definitive meaning is ngedön  and
the provisional or indicative meaning is drangdön . As definitive
meaning, we have the teachings of the Mind-only and Middle-wayschool. However, if teachings of the definitive meaning were presentedto trainees at the beginning, it would be too much for them; theywouldn’t understand. Therefore, Buddha taught beginners the waythings appear to beginners. And the analysis, therefore, begins withstudying the appearance of things as gross or coarse or roughphenomena, analyzing to see if they are indeed such and seeing thatthey probably aren’t. One can then say, “No, that isn’t really what theyare. They are composed of parts and moments.” So, Buddha began byteaching ordinary persons in accordance with the way that thingsappeared to ordinary persons. And the experience of ordinary personsis that which we are calling “mind” has the nature of knowledge andwhat we are calling “external phenomena” has the nature of beingexternal, material, solid, obstructive stuff. In the Vaibhashika school,the relation between the perceiving consciousness and the perceivedphenomena is that one thing looks directly at the other; theapprehended phenomena is that which is looked at and theapprehending consciousness or knower is that which looks directly,one at the other.
Question : Is the self of persons overcome by looking at our mind, the
one who apprehends things?Rinpoche : When we speak of a self of persons, we are not speaking just
about an apprehension of one’s internal mind, rather what that refersto is the collection or aggregation of all five skandhas, all five aggregates.It is the apprehension of those five together that one considers to be“I.” In dependence upon apprehending those skandhas as “I,” one
93
gives birth to various sorts of disturbing emotions, kleshas. Through
recognizing that the basis for the generation of that thought “I” doesnot exist, then one is able to abandon the kleshas that arise independence upon thinking “I.” Therefore, one seeks to realize theselflessness of the person in meditation. However, having done so,having realized the person’s lack of a self does not amount to havingrealized the emptiness of either internal or external phenomena.
Question : You spoke about the two practices of Mahamudra and
Dzogchen. I wonder what is Dzogchen and how does it differ fromMahamudra?Rinpoche : There isn’t much of a difference. There is a difference in
terms of the transmission or lineage through which the oral instructionshave passed from teacher to student. The oral instructions of theDzogchen begin with the teacher Garab Dorje and passed to his studentShri Simha and so forth. The oral instructions of the Mahamudratradition begin with Tilopa, passed from Tilopa to Naropa and soforth. There are differences in terms of method and the quintessentialinstructions. However, in terms of when we are settling just that whichis meditated upon, where do we look? Where do we meditate? Wemeditate upon the manner of abiding, particularly, the mind’s mannerof abiding and thus those who practice the tradition of Dzogchen(great completeness) are led in terms of the mind and meditate uponthe mind’s way of abiding. Those who practice the tradition ofMahamudra (the great seal) are led in terms of the mind and meditateupon the mind’s true nature. For that reason, there is no difference inthe thing, the meaning or the practice itself. There are differences interms of the quintessential instructions by which the view is generated,but not in the thing itself. So, by way of the various differences inquintessential instructions, we speak about the different traditions,the one of the great seal and the other of the great completeness.
Question : Is one better than the other?
Rinpoche :  I think that they are mostly the same.A Brief Presentation of the T ext
94 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
Question : I didn’t understand why the Mind-only school is lower than
the Middle-way school?Rinpoche : The Mind-only school views all phenomena appearing as
appearances of mind or appearances for mind, while the mind trulyexists. How do we settle the view in terms of the Middle-way school?It is through analyzing worldly, confused or mistaken appearances andunderstanding that such confused appearances are not inherentlyestablished. The word that the Middle-way school uses to describethis lack of inherent existence or lack of any nature of its own is“emptiness” or shunyata in Sanskrit. Thus, the Middle-way schoolshows that all outer and inner phenomena are empty of inherentexistence. Never theless, such phenomena naturally appear to or for our
mind conventionally. The demonstration of all phenomena as lackinginherent existence is the particular tenet of the Middle-way school.
Question : The argument of the Mind-only school, which establishes
that appearances are only mind, is strange because this only seems toprove that we simply don’t experience some things. There could bethings that, in fact, we don’t experience that don’t appear for the mindand yet have existence. This argument does not address that. Iapparently don’t understand this argument. Would you explain it morecarefully, please?Rinpoche : You have to look very closely at the reason why you think
that something that does not appear to your mind exists. If you thinkthat something that does not appear to your mind exists, it has got tobe either from the point of view of a correct sign of its existence orfrom the point of view of direct perception; those are the only twopossibilities. You have to look very closely at the reason why you thinkthat something that does not appear to your mind nevertheless exists.
Question : But, what would be a correct sign? What exactly do you
mean by that terminology?Rinpoche : Sign means reason. You have to have a reason. What is the
reason for thinking that something that has never appeared to anyone’smind exists?
95
Question : You explained the fifth verse, “the characteristics of dharma,”
and said that there are three definite characteristics of dharma: duality,assumption and formulation. The first is the duality of the perceiverand the perceived. I am not sure whether what you have discussed sofar comes under that point or whether it is the second or third.Rinpoche : In this talk I spoke about the non-existence of apprehended
and apprehender and the way that they seem to exist and about theappearance of apprehended and apprehender as two, about dualisticappearance and about the incorrectness of that appearance. So, we arein the first.
Question : Rinpoche, you said, I believ e, “that all appearances are mind”
but what about the cup of tea? I’m confused at this point.Rinpoche : What is being said is that things are merely appearances to
or for mind and not that they are made by mind in that way. Thingsare not an independent display. Like a reflection in a mirror, putsomething in front of a mirror and then there is a reflection or anappearance of that thing in a mirror. But, it is not just anything thatappears in the mirror.
Question : So, there’s no volition?
Rinpoche : No, it’s not just because you want it. Therefore, we have to
meditate. If it were a matter of what we wanted, then whenever thingsshould run pleasant, we could say, “Let things be pleasant.” But itdoesn’t work that way.A Brief Presentation of the T ext

CHAPTER  THREE
A Detailed Examination of Dharma
In this text we are examining the differences between dharma and
dharmata. In the previous chapter we discussed the brief explanations
of dharma and dharmata. Next come the detailed explanations. In thischapter we will discuss the detailed explanation of the characteristicsof dharma or ordinary phenomena. This discussion is given in termsof six points.
III. T HE DETAILED  EXPLANATION  OF DHARMA
A. A N OVERVIEW  OF THE SIX POINTS
10. Because it provides a thorough introductionTo their characteristics as well as their rationale,Their neither being the same nor different,The ground in common and not in common shared,And the lack of appearance involving perceiver-perceived,This six-point approach to phenomena is the best.

98 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
This verse outlines the six points: (1) definitive characteristics, (2)
rationale, (3) being neither same nor different, (4) common ground,(5) not shared in common, and (6) lack of perceiver and perceived.
B. A D ETAILED  EXPLANATION
1. D EFINING  CHARACTERISTICS
2. T HE RATIONALE
3. B EING NEITHER  SAME NOR DIFFERENT
11. Of these, the defining traits and the rationale,As well as the lack of sameness and difference,Are just as these were demonstrated in brief.
This verse says that the first three points have already been discussed
in the previous chapter and won’t be discussed further. These threepoints were: (1) the definitive character or traits of dharma anddharmata, (2) rationale, the nature which is mistaken, and (3) thequestion of whether or not dharmas and dharmata are identical ordifferent.
 TWO TYPES OF EXPERIENCE
12. As long as there is someone circling somewhereThese are the grounds in each and every case –The constituents of beings and those of the vessel.The constituents of the vessel appear to be shared,The awareness being the common experience;Some of the constituents of beingsAre experienced in common and some are not.
The next topic is where are sentient beings born, where do they dwell,
and why do they continue to revolve within samsara or cyclic existence.
99
This topic has two aspects: the elements (Skt. dhatu ) of sentient beings
and the elements of the world that serve as the vessel. First of all, if weare speaking about the elements of sentient beings, we are consideringmind and the individuality of sentient beings. When we are consideringthe external elements, we are interested in questions such as wheresentient beings are born, where they live and so forth. As for the externalvessel that sentient beings inhabit, although there are slight differencesfor the individual mind of each sentient being, generally speaking it’smore or less identical: i.e., the way in which a mountain appears tosomeone is the same for different people.
4. T HE COMMON  GROUND
13. Further, birth and conventions, to nurture, subdue,Benefit, harm, excellent features and faultsAre mutually caused by way of an interchange,Because of which these are experience shared in common.
If we consider states that are common and approach this by seeking to
understand how it is that various states are common to different sentientbeings and how uncommon experiences come about, first of allconsidering those that are common, there would be the matter of birth,the activities of body and speech, work, conversation, discussion,helping or harming someone, the development of good qualities orfaults. Some matters are not accomplished by one sentient being alone,but rather are accomplished through the interaction of a variety ofsentient beings. For instance, for a sentient being to be born we needthree people – the mother, father and the person who is born.
32 In this
way, a shared or common appearance comes about.33 With regard to
the activities of body and speech, the work that we do physically isdone in common with others. As for speech, it requires someonewho is speaking and someone who is listening. As for helping ordoing harm, we need at least two individuals making this a shared ormutual experience.

100 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
5. N OT SHARED  IN COMMON
14. Since the ground and awareness, happiness, suffering,
Action, transition at death, captivity, birth,And liberation are not observed in common,They comprise the realm of experience not shared incommon.
As for uncommon states or uncommon appearances we are discussing
that which appears only for ourselves alone. The two topics here aresource and consciousnesses.
6. L ACK OF PERCEIVER  AND PERCEIVED
A. THE ALAYA CONSCIOUSNESS
15. What appear to be outer, perceivable in common,
Are perceiving awareness; they are not referentsExisting as something extrinsic to consciousness,Precisely because they are common experiences.
When we say “the source” what we mean is that the alaya consciousness
serves as the basis or source for all appearances. When, as Buddhists,we assert appearances to be mind, we are not saying that, for instancewhen we are inside a particular building, nothing else exists. We arenot saying that such things do not exist because they cannot appear inour mind. Rather, when we go somewhere else, that suitability for
appearances to dawn resides as latencies or predispositions withineach individual person’s mind-basis of all or alaya consciousness (Skt.alaya vijnana.  Tib. kunshi nampar shepa ). When we go somewhere
else, it is suitable for such things to appear because we havepredispositions or latencies such that such appearances can indeedcome about; then in fact they do and they will at that point appearas objects for our own consciousnesses.
35
101
B. THE OTHER  CONSCIOUSNESSES
16. The counterpart is the one in which what is perceived
Is not shared in common. Here awareness’ referentIs the minds and so on associated with others.These do not comprise an object of mutual exchangeFor perceiving awareness not resting nor resting poised,Because, for those not resting in equipoise,It is but their own conceptions which appear;And because, for those who are resting in equipoise,It is its faithful reflection that appearsAs the object encountered during samadhi absorption.
Next the text discusses the other seven consciousnesses. At this point
we are certain that appearances are just appearances for mind. Theword “minds” in the third line refers to the eight consciousnesses withthe eighth, the alaya consciousness, being the basis for the other sevenconsciousnesses.
The first five consciousnesses are called the “consciousnesses of
the five gates.” The gates are the five senses. They are called gates becausethey seem to be the gates by means of which your mind encountersthat which is outside your body. So they are like gates by means ofwhich your mind can project itself or expand itself beyond the body.The first of the five gates is the eyes. The eyes are the organic basis forthe eye consciousness. The eyes encounter as their object visible form,color and shape. This comes about because of the eye sense-power.When the eyes encounter an object, what is generated is called the “eyeor visual consciousness.” That is the first of the five sense-consciousnesses. The other four are similar to that. The secondconsciousness is connected with the ears; because of an ear sense-power,various sorts of sounds are heard by the ear consciousness. This appliesto the third olfactory consciousness that perceives various odors. Theseare perceived in dependence upon a nose sense-power. Then, the tonguesense-power allows various tastes to be perceived by the fourth tongueconsciousness. The fifth is the whole body as an organ of tactilesensation; various tangible objects (some smooth, some rough, someA Detailed Examination of Dharma
102 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
painful and so forth) are experienced by the body consciousness because
of the body sense-power.
So these consciousnesses operate by way of the five gates or doors
with the five doors being the five sensory organs. The five sense-consciousnesses are non-conceptual consciousnesses so that the eyeconsciousness, for example, doesn’t think about the past or present;rather it apprehends the visual object as it exists right now. It doesn’tthink the object is good or bad; it just sees clearly. Similarly, the othersense-consciousnesses do not evaluate the past or future, accept orreject things as being good or bad. They simply see what exists rightnow. It is direct experience. Therefore these consciousnesses are non-conceptual and do not generate any thought about the characteristicsof what they experience, they do not conceptually recognize the thingsthat they perceive or experience.
Our misperception of outer appearances is not really due to some
defect in the five sensory consciousnesses. What is greatly mistaken inour perception is the sixth, mental consciousness. The mentalconsciousness is conceptual and thinks about what is experienced bythe five senses, it conceptually recognizes them as such and such, itthinks about whether things are good or bad and mixes external sensoryinformation with names and labels. The mental consciousness doesnot work with or appear on the basis of a specific sense organ like theother five. It inhabits the body in a general way and it is that whichthinks. Its function is thinking. The fundamental distinction betweenit and the others is that the five sense-consciousnesses, since they engageonly in the direct experience of their objects, can only experience thepresent. The sixth consciousness on the other hand can and does thinkabout things. The sixth consciousness thinks of the past, both the distantand recent past. It thinks about the present and it thinks about thefuture, both the proximate and distant future. But while it is capableof thinking it is not capable of directly experiencing things the waythat the sense-consciousnesses do. The sixth consciousness does notdirectly experience things. It generates a generality or abstraction onthe basis of the things that are experienced by the five senseconsciousnesses. This means that when the five sense consciousnessesexperience something, it becomes an object of thought for the sixth
103
consciousness, not in the form of what is actually experienced but in
the form of a conceptual generality or generalization or abstractionthat is created by the sixth consciousness as a duplicate or replica ofwhat was experienced by that particular sense-consciousness. Forexample, when I look at the glass that is on the table in front of me,my eyes directly see that glass, but my sixth consciousness, my mentalconsciousness, does not directly see it. It generates a generality orabstraction based upon what my eyes have seen, which it thenrecognizes, thinks about, thinks of as good or bad, or having such andsuch shape and so on.
To further explain, for example, the mental consciousness doesn’t
produce a vivid perceptual image when a name of a person is mentioned;rather, a general form and name of that person just appears to thisconsciousness upon hearing the name. So it is called “a conceptual
consciousness that apprehends the sound and the object in a mannerof mixing them together.” When we say that the sound and the objectare mixed, we mean that the label and the meaning are combined orthe name of something and the thing itself appear in a mixed fashion.For instance, for the bell in front of me, the name “bell” is not aninherent part of the thing in front of me; it is just a name that is givento the object. However, the mental consciousness apprehends thesetwo as mixed, the image of the object I see and the label “bell.”
The seventh consciousness is the afflicted consciousness (Skt.
klesha-mana  Tib. nyön yid ). It is not strongly afflicted by disturbing
emotions; it is just not clear. So it refers to the subtle or most basiclevel of mental affliction or klesha. This does not refer to coarse kleshasbut to the root of kleshas. Specifically, the afflicted consciousness isthe subtlest level of fixation on a self. So the nature of this seventhconsciousness is to conceive something as self. Again this is not coarsefixation on a self. This is the subtle level of fixation on a self that isunfluctuatingly present even when one is asleep. The conception ofself operates in a twofold way. First of all, the sixth consciousnessconceives self, thinking “I.” It thinks so in a very clear way. However,the sixth consciousness is not stable. It thinks about other things. Itgoes here and there and gets involved with all kinds of different objectsand when it is involved with other sorts of things, it is not thinkingA Detailed Examination of Dharma
104 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
“I,” and it forgets about self. However, whether or not we are thinking
directly about self, we never forget self; the conception of self is alwaysthere. This is because the mental consciousness operates with the seventhconsciousness that is always conceiving self, which is the second way.When sometimes you have a sense of self and you think “I,” that is notan operation of the seventh consciousness. That is the sixthconsciousness thinking. The seventh consciousness is present until youattain the levels of an Arya, or Superior, such as the first bodhisattva
level and so on. Although it is not directly observable itself, it is the
basis for all coarse fixation on a self and therefore for all coarse kleshas.
The first seven consciousnesses operate in conjunction with the
eighth, the alaya consciousness.
36 These eight consciousnesses are
appearances only for oneself; they do not appear for others. Thereforethey are uncommon appearances or states.
The Feelings
Another uncommon state of sentient beings would be various feelings,
such as those of pleasure and pain or happiness and suffering thatoccur in body and mind. Generally speaking, there are three differenttypes of feelings: pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neutralfeelings. In terms of mind, there is first a pleasant feeling (such as joy,admiration or liking for something) and the unpleasant mental feelingof something as disagreeable and unattractive. Thirdly, one mightexperience something as neither pleasant nor unpleasant, but just havea sort of in-between feeling. Similarly, the body has three feelings:those of pleasure, those of pain and a neutral feeling that is neitherpleasant nor painful. We can also categorize these feelings into fivegroups: pleasant feelings as one; displeasure as the second and, pleasureand pain for body as three and four, and then a neutral feeling of bodyor of mind as the fifth type of feeling. These feelings are uncommonappearances or uncommon states because they are not shared with orby other sentient beings.
We say that all phenomena are “just mind” and there are two
types of appearances of mind: those that are shared with others, andthose that are not shared with others. Uncommon or unshared
105
appearances would include the unpleasurable feelings associated with
death and birth, and all the personal feelings we perceive in samsara.
Common appearances are like mountains and buildings. Unshared
appearances are much easier to understand than shared appearancesbecause we think that common appearances really exist as externalphenomena. However, they do not exist apart from our own mindand thus the text teaches that they are not external phenomena.
What is the reason why such common appearances are said to be
“just mind”? The way in which such apparently common appearancesare seen is that they appear to the individual mind of individual sentientbeings. That which appears for our own mind is not known by othersand that which appears to or for the mind of others is not known byourselves. So, although the appearance is similar, it is not somethingthat can be known by another person in the way that it is known byoneself. And except for this similarity, it is not actually the same.
A Practical Exercise
Presently people are very worried and anxious because there is the
great danger of a war breaking out in Nepal. So, considering theexperience of pain, pleasure and a neutral feeling, let us meditate for awhile. The way in which we will meditate at this point is called“meditation having the observation of pleasure and pain and neutralfeeling.” We imagine all sentient beings in front of us and through themedium of the breath, we visualize our own happiness to be replacedwith the suffering of others. At this juncture, the main point isunderstanding that the disturbing emotions of attachment, hatred,pride and so forth are the cause and the effect is fear. So as our breathgoes out, we imagine that light rays of love and compassion go forthand strike other sentient beings. Those sentient beings then experiencelove and compassion and the absence of fear. The light rays return toourselves on the in-breath and with that breath, we draw in the fearand the disturbing emotions of others, so that they become free fromsuch fear and disturbing emotions.
We said that all appearances are mind with there being common
or shared appearances among sentient beings and unshared appearances.A Detailed Examination of Dharma
106 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
It is easy to understand that the uncommon appearances are just mind.
However, it is more difficult to understand that external phenomena,the common shared appearances, those phenomena that appear to beshared, are just mind. It is difficult to generate certainty and aknowledgeable understanding of that easily and quickly. There is nofault in not being able to do that easily and quickly. When I first beganto study, I had difficulty with this point.
C. CLEARING  AWAY DOUBTS
Previously, we discussed the views of the four different schools (theVaibhashika, the Sautrantika, the Cittamatra, and the Madhyamaka).I explained the way in which external phenomena are first shown to bemerely aggregations of small partless particles. Then, those particlesthemselves are refuted and demonstrated to be just appearances ofmind. Then the mind itself is shown to be empty. Here I wish tofurther elaborate on the differences of the Vaibhashika and Sautrantikaschools.
The Vaibhashika school holds that external phenomena are
aggregations of particles and those aggregations of particles make upthe objects that are perceived by consciousnesses. The internalconsciousnesses are generated based upon the sense powers, so thatthe internal consciousness looks at and sees an external phenomenon.In this way we have a presentation of something inside that looks atand perceives something outside, which in general accords with thecommon way of thinking.
The Sautrantika point of view on this matter is different. They
point out that the internal consciousnesses have a nature of luminousclarity and awareness, whereas external phenomena have a nature orcharacter of being material and thus the definitive character of the twois extremely different. Since their character is so different, it is not thatone thing looks directly at another; rather the external object serves asa cause and the internal consciousness is the effect of that cause. Therelationship between cause and effect is that they are not simultaneous;rather, the cause goes before and the effect comes later. Therefore, the
107
object and the consciousness that perceives the object don’t occur
simultaneously, but rather their relationship is that the cause is said tobe the benefitor and the effect is said to be that which is benefited.
So, in this way the perceived object and the consciousness have
the aspect of cause and effect. In the first moment, the object and theinternal sense-power aggregate meet; in the second moment, the internalknowing consciousness is generated in the aspect of the object. In thatway, the consciousness and the object do not actually meet directly.
In the Sautrantika school’s way of explaining the process of
perception, the appearance itself is explained as an appearance of mind.However, the cause of the appearance is said to be the external, materialphenomena that have the nature of being established as particles. Intheir explanation, the appearance is an appearance for individualconsciousnesses, for individual mind. Then the Mind-only school goesa step further and says, if there were in fact no particles serving as abasis for it, then that would be correct.
The Sautrantika school’s view is between the Vaibhashika and
the Cittamatra view and explains the way in which appearances aremerely mental phenomena. It serves as an intermediate step that issomewhat easier to understand and in regard to which certainty iseasier to come by.
External Appearances are Just Mind
The objection is raised to the view that all appearances are mind.
This is due to it being possible for one person to apprehend themind of another person directly, and that when one personapprehends another person’s mind directly, it is not a case ofapprehending something that is just an appearance of one’s own mind.This is an example of the apprehension of something that is not anappearance of one’s own mind.
37
The response to this argument is twofold: in one we are talking
about the perception of another’s mind within meditation and in thesecond case we are talking about the perception of another’s mind notwithin meditation. When not in meditation, perceiving another person’smind is a case of one’s own thought appearing in the aspect of anotherA Detailed Examination of Dharma
108 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
person’s mind. The perception of another person’s mind in meditation
is when one perceives another person’s mind through the force ofone’s own meditative stabilization and the other person’s mind appearsas a reflection. The reflection of another’s mind appears in an aspectthat is similar to it. So, it is an apprehension of the reflection orlikeness of another person’s mind, not a case of seeing another person’smind directly.
38
Internal Events are Also Empty
The discussion then proceeds to demonstrating the emptiness of
internal consciousnesses and reviews the argument given before thatthe emptiness of the external phenomenon entails the emptiness ofinternal consciousness. For example, if there is a spot of blue, then aconsciousness apprehending that spot of blue is produced. If there isno external spot of blue, then no such consciousness of the blue spotwill be generated. In this way, the generation of an internalconsciousness is shown to be dependent upon the externalphenomenon. So if there is no external phenomenon, then there is nointernal consciousness. So if we establish external phenomena to beempty, then internal phenomena must also be empty. In this way, wecome to realize the nature of phenomena or what is called dharmata.
Not recognizing the emptiness of phenomena is the cause of
suffering. If we have a strong belief in external phenomena, this leadsus to regard external phenomena as either good or bad. If we feel thatthe external phenomena are good, then we develop strong attachmentto these external phenomena. If we regard external phenomena as bad,then we develop a strong aversion to them. This leads to furthersuffering. However, if we understand that external phenomena are notsolid from the very first, then both the cause of suffering and theresulting suffering will be naturally pacified.
109
D. FREEDOM  FROM  PERCEIVER  AND PERCEIVED
17. If what appears as perceived does not exist,
Whatever appears as perceiver does not exist;Due to this, there is also a rationaleBehind the breakthrough to freedom from this appearanceOf perceived and perceiver, because without beginningA volatile state prevails; and because duality’sNot existing at all is what really exists.
There are many different kinds of emptinesses discussed in the Buddha’s
sutras. On one occasion the Buddha spoke about four different typesof emptiness. In the Heart  Sutra  it says “there is no form, no feeling,
no perception… no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue… noconsciousness,” and so forth; everything is empty, all phenomena lackinherent existence.
The Buddha’s sutras say that phenomena are empty, but apart
from saying that they are just empty, no reasons for this are given.From just reading the sutras, it is difficult immediately to arrive at adefinite idea of the meaning of such statements. Therefore, manylearned persons have given reasons that allow us to understand whyphenomena are empty.
The main logical argument for emptiness is the reasoning of
dependent arising that was set forth by Nagarjuna. He explained thatall phenomena depend upon one another and because of this they arenot truly established.
We can illustrate this dependent relationship in terms of an
example. I am holding up two sticks. One is four inches long and theother is two inches long. We say that there is “a long one” for the four-inch stick and “a short one” for the two-inch stick. When we think ofthese sticks, we think “this stick is long” and “that stick is short.” If wetake a third stick which is six inches long and remove the two-inchstick, we see that the stick that we used to see as the long one, now hasbecome the short one. Previously, it was long, now it is short. Thereason for this is that the stick wasn’t inherently long to begin with;our mind just attributed the quality of “long” to it because it was nextA Detailed Examination of Dharma
110 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
to a shorter stick. Then when we put the three of them together, there
is a short one, a long one and the one in the middle, which seems to beneither short nor long. In fact, “short,” “long” and so forth are justdesignated or imputed by our mind; they don’t exist (or we could say“are not inherent”) in the object itself. This is not limited to “short”and “long” but it also applies to “big and small,” “good and bad,”“beautiful and ugly,” “above and below,” “east, south, north, west”and so on.
Another example would be that there is no direction that is really
east and no direction that is actually west because these directionsdepend upon the relationship between objects. For instance, we talkabout the east and the west. The east refers to Asia and the west refersto Europe and the Americas. But if we ask, “What is the reason forsaying that Asia is the east and Europe and the Americas are the west?”There isn’t any reason whatsoever. East and west are just designated orimputed by our mind. In this way, all these sorts of phenomena turnout to be mere conceptual formulations. However, some people wouldsay, “Well, that’s all well and good when we are talking aboutcomparative qualities, but that doesn’t apply to things existing on theirown, for instance a house, a building, or a body which is made out ofparticles. Dependent arising doesn’t apply there.”
If we were to consider a particular example of a “solid” object
such as our hand, we see it and other people see it. But really, where isit? If we were to divide and classify the hand, then we would see thatthere is a thumb, a first finger, a second finger and so forth; there isflesh, skin, bone and so on. Where, then, is the hand? Well really, thereis no hand. How is it that “hand” comes about? It is in dependenceupon the various fingers, the flesh, skin, bones and so forth that wedesignate or impute something, to which we give the name “hand,”but in fact, “hand” is not substantially existent. This does not onlyapply to one’s hand. It applies to one’s right hand, one’s left hand, legs,head, all external phenomena. Whenever we investigate and analyze,we discover it is merely the gathering together (the collection oraggregation) of many different things, which we conceive as “a largething.” However, that thing is merely designated or imputed by ourown mind. The Buddha expressed this fact by speaking of the emptiness
111
of outer phenomena, the emptiness of inner phenomena, and the fact
that these phenomenon are not truly established. In fact phenomenais not validly existent; external and internal phenomena are empty ofinherent existence.
If things are empty, does that mean that nothing is apprehended
whatsoever? No, that’s not what it means. This is not a refutation ofappearances per se, rather it shows that even though there is nothingthat is in itself “long,” nevertheless if there is something in relation toit that is short, something is said to be “long” and something is said tobe “short.” This dependent relationship also applies to self and other.Even though there is no self, because we think “other,” we automaticallythink “I.” And even though there is no “other,” it is created by thinking“I.” We could also apply this to mountains, the “near” mountain andthe “distant” mountain. One mountain is near and depends uponanother mountain being further away. Another mountain is far awayin dependence upon another mountain being nearer.
Thus, dharmata or how things really are is not empty in the way
that space is just empty; rather emptiness allows phenomena to appear.And within the nature of emptiness, phenomena arise. This then showsus how conventional phenomena or appearances that we perceive, andthe ultimate lack of inherent existence (emptiness) fit together. Thus,conventional, dependent appearances and the lack of inherent existenceor emptiness do not contradict one another.
There is unceasing appearance of both inner phenomena and outer
phenomena and therefore many sorts of different appearances dawnbecause of strong predispositions or latencies. If we discuss this interms of experience, we could consider the example of a dream. Varioussorts of phenomena appear in a dream, but are they what they seem tobe? No, they are not, nevertheless they do appear. If we dream anelephant, it clearly appears to us, but there is no real elephant in theroom with us. This is an example of the way in which conventionalappearances arise even though they do not really exist.
We first begin to understand dharmata or “the nature of
phenomena” intellectually, then we meditate upon it and finally itbecomes manifest. Since the nature of phenomena is naturally peaceful,therefore when we realize it, our own disturbing emotions diminishA Detailed Examination of Dharma
112 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
and cease and suffering that ordinarily comes about from external and
internal phenomena is eliminated. So, this is why it is extremelyimportant and necessary to understand emptiness of external andinternal phenomena.
Questions
Question : In meditation practice, if we have thoughts of love and of
benefiting others that are only in our own mind, that are onlyuncommon appearances, how can they possibly benefit anyone else?Rinpoche : Such meditation, such cultivation of love and compassion,
does not directly benefit other people; rather through meditating inthat way, one’s own love and compassion increase. The potency orcapacity of one’s own love and compassion becomes stronger. Throughbecoming stronger it enters into all of one’s behavior, whether by wayof body, speech or mind one’s behavior becomes pervaded by love andcompassion. When that happens, then one can actually help others.For that reason, we cultivate love and compassion in meditation.
Question : I asked Tai Situ Rinpoche if it is possible to do the tonglen
practice over time and space for people who are dead, and he said yes.Would you explain how that is possible?Rinpoche : Generally speaking, the main purpose of this practice of
tonglen or “sending and taking” is to increase love and compassion inour own mind and to abandon the wish to harm others, together withenvy, aggression and so forth. When we do the practice of sending andtaking, some people generate great hope and fear about it. People thinkthat through giving away all of their own happiness and drawing inthe suffering of others, they will indeed end up with immeasurablesickness and hardship. Others have great hope in regarding theircompanions, parents, loved ones; for instance, at a time when such aperson becomes ill, they think that they can extract that illness fromthem and draw it to themselves. In that way they have great hope.However, neither such hope nor such fear is purposeful, necessary orto the point. The main point of sending and taking meditation is thecultivation of our own mind, developing a pure motivation, fixing,
113
healing or repairing our motivation and intention, making it something
extremely pure and developing a great force of love and compassionand the wish to help others. If we do this, it is not the case that if wewere to develop such a motivation there would not be a benefit forothers; rather gradually there would be a great benefit for others, if wehad such a motivation.
For example, if someone had the wish and intention to go to Lhasa,
Tibet, although some circumstances might make it possible to go, otheroccasions or circumstances might make it not possible to go;nevertheless, having such an intention we could eventually go to Lhasa.However, if we had no such intention at all, then we would not go.Similarly, if we have a pure motivation to help others, then whether ornot we are able to help them in a particular way, nevertheless in theend, through cultivating such an intention, the fruition will eventuallybe achieved and we will finally be of great benefit for others.
Sometimes a person who has a very determined good thought or
kindness is indeed able to help another person directly. For instance,there is a story of the great master Atisha, who at one point in his lifehad a disease in his hand. He said to his student Dronden that ifDronden were to take Atisha´s hand and hold it in a particular way,his hand would be restored to health through doing the practice ofsending and taking. Atisha told Dronden, “The reason why you willbe able to do so is that you have extremely great kindness.” So, it doeshappen that there could be direct benefit of a temporary sort withsending and taking practice.
Question : Rinpoche, you made two logical arguments and I was unable
to follow them, although I heard what you said. If a patch of bluereally existed, then necessarily the internal consciousness would exist.Maybe you could say something about that?Rinpoche : If blue exists, then there is a consciousness apprehending
blue. If form exists, then there is a consciousness apprehending form.If the object that is apprehended is true, then the consciousnessapprehending that object will be true. However, if the object (let ussay a form) is not a true object, then the consciousness apprehendingit similarly will not be a true consciousness. That conventional,A Detailed Examination of Dharma
114 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
deceptive consciousness is not something that is true. It has to do with
the relationship between the perceived or apprehended and the perceiveror apprehending consciousness. In Tibetan they are linked quite closely,they say that one is the object and the perceiving consciousness iscalled “the object possessor,” indicating the relationship between thetwo. If the object is false, then that which bears the object similarly isfalse. Does that make it clear?
Question : Yes, but why is the apprehending consciousness necessarily
false?Rinpoche :  If the seed or cause is true, then the effect or result will be
true. If the seed is false, then the fruit will similarly be false. In thiscase, since the object is false, then its result or its fruit, the perceivingor apprehending subject, is similarly false.
Question : We all have the same true nature, which is dharmata. At the
same time we are part of phenomena. We have no self, but at the sametime we create our own individual karma. Why is this?Rinpoche : We speak about what is called “the way or manner of abiding”
and “the way of confusion” or “the way of error.” As for the way ofabiding, there is no self; there is neither a self of persons nor a self ofphenomena. However, in the way of confusion, one is confused aboutpersons and about phenomena, thinking that there is a self of personsand a self of phenomena. In that way, within confusion one becomesinvolved in various sorts of actions and creates various situations ofhappiness and suffering. However, this is taking place within confusion.For instance, in a dream one might dream of an elephant or dream ofa horse and become frightened or become delighted. Is there actuallyan elephant or is there actually such a horse? Well, in terms of the wayin which things abide, there is no elephant, there is no horse. But interms of the way in which they appear, most certainly, one does dreamof an elephant or a horse and there is an appearance of an elephant anda horse. So, in the context of waking life, there are various sorts ofactions and there are various effects or fruits of actions. Do such actionsand their results dawn or appear? Yes, they certainly do. Are they true?
115
No, they are not true. Will we realize their lack of truth in the future?
Yes, most definitely.
Question : In the way things abide, everything is the same?
Rinpoche : Yes.
Question : If everything is the same, why is there duality and variety?
Rinpoche : There are various kinds of mistaken appearances for mind;
however, there is no particular reason for those appearances; there isno very good reason for them, there is no great reason. If one were tosay, why did this elephant appear in this dream? There is no particularlygood reason why an elephant appeared in a dream.
Question : If there were something that existed but did not appear to
anyone’s mind, how would one know that there is nothing that existsthat doesn’t appear to anyone’s mind?Rinpoche : What is the reason for thinking that there is something that
doesn’t appear to anyone’s mind?
Question : What would constitute the existence of such a thing?
Rinpoche : Well it would have to be established in some way as separate
from one’s mind. What would qualify as evidence of something existingdespite its not appearing to anyone’s mind would have to be establishedas something apart from mind. That would be sufficient evidence.However, there isn’t any such thing. No matter what there is, it onlyhappens in the context of appearing to one’s mind. It is because ofappearances to mind that one engages in conversation. It is because ofappearances to one’s mind that one engages in various activities.Whatever we look for, it is purely an appearance to mind. In brief: Ifthere is no appearance, then there is no working; i.e., nothing happens.
Question : If something really existed, there would be no deception. I
am thinking from a dualistic perspective, thinking about the perceiverand the notion of flawed human perception. I am wondering whatRinpoche would say about that?Translator : When you say flawed human perception, are you speakingA Detailed Examination of Dharma
116 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
about the mechanism of sensory perception?
Student : Yes, and interpretation.
Translator : That is the distinction I am trying to get. Are you talking
about non-conceptual sensory activity or are you talking aboutconceptual activity? This dictates the way that I have to ask the questionand why I am pursuing it. I need to be precise. Whether there can beobjects that don’t appear to consciousness or you are asking abouttruth and deception, this is hard.Student : I guess I am connected with the argument that if something
really existed, then there would be no deception. Maybe I ampostulating the fact that deception of whatever could come from aflawed way of perceiving, a process, a part of a human condition butnot necessarily.Translator : Okay, I will ask Rinpoche a very traditional example. What
about a person with bad eyes seeing falling hairs in front of them.Rinpoche : Yes. For instance, a person who has cataracts would have a
perception of what looks like hair falling. In fact, this is mistaken andthere are no falling hairs that are established in the way that they appearto be established, that exist in the way that they appear to exist. In thatway, the appearance is deceptive. Deception does not come into whatis true. Deception comes only into that which is mistaken, like forinstance those falling hairs. Once there is a mistaken or erroneousappearance, then one’s mind is deceived.
Question : According to the Buddhist point of view, if a non-Buddhist
were to assert true existence, what would that assertion be? What wouldthat assertion necessarily contain within it?Rinpoche : We Buddhists say that all phenomena are not inherently
established and we affirm this lack of inherent establishment as theway in which things abide. Others assert that phenomena do existtruly, inherently, by way of their own nature, and from that point ofview they are mistaken. However, this does not mean that every lastthing that they have to say is useless; there are many things that arepresented and are quite useful, such as skilful means (Skt. upaya ),
methods that are helpful in a variety of ways. However, from the point
117
of view of asserting a self when there is, in fact, no self and asserting
true existence when, in fact, things lack true existence, they are mistaken.
Question :  What does it mean to say that something exists externally?
Rinpoche : Something existing externally would mean that it is not just
an appearance for one’s own mind, it is not just an aspect of one’s ownmind, it is something other than one’s mind. It exists somewhere apartfrom that. Buddhists generally, and here we are particularly talkingabout the Mind-only school, say that phenomena are just mind andparticularly in the division of the Middle-way school called “empty ofother” say that things do not exist apart from one’s own mind; they donot exist elsewhere, separately. However, people tend to think thatthey do. Despite thinking that phenomena do exist apart from one’sown mind, in fact, such does not occur. If one looks for phenomenasomewhere else, one will not find them. The reason why one will notfind them is because they do not exist.
Question : Do the phrases like “appearing to the mind” or “appearing
for the mind,” mean the same as the phrase “appearances being mind”?Rinpoche : I think those statements have the same meaning. Generally
when we are speaking of the Mind-only school, there are two differentaspects to that. One meaning of mind only is said to be “mind only inthe sense that there is no other creator” and the other meaning ofmind only is said to be “mind only in the sense of there being no otherappearances.” So mind only in the sense that it is one’s own mind thatcreates things, it is not something else that creates them, and secondly,mind only in the sense that apparent or appearing objects are not otherthan one’s own mind. Those are the two aspects of mind only. Thefirst, speaking of no creator that is other than mind, refers to the factthat it depends upon afflictions or disturbing emotions that one engagesin actions. Actions accumulate predispositions or latencies. Latenciesgive rise to appearances and appearances produce feelings of pleasureand pain. Thus, there is no creator that is other than one’s own mind.The second means straightforwardly that those objects that appear tovarious consciousnesses are just mind; they are not something other orseparate from those perceiving consciousnesses themselves. In thisA Detailed Examination of Dharma
118 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
discussion, we are talking about the second of those two, the assertion
that appearances are just mind. The different phrases “appearing tomind” or “appearing for mind” aren’t said differently in Tibetan; thosestatements on the one hand and the other statement saying that“appearances are mind” mean the same thing.
Question : Is it living within the envelope of one’s own alaya in the
various appearances?Rinpoche : Yes, it’s like that.
Question : How can there be any common appearances at all?
Rinpoche : In this text on differentiating dharmas and dharmata there
is a discussion of appearances that are common and appearances thatare uncommon. I don’t need to say a whole lot about uncommonappearances; we already understand that they are uncommon. As forcommon appearances, what are called “common appearances” refersto the fact that they seem to be common.Translator : At the end I said something about the stupa.
Rinpoche : There is a stupa; we all see a stupa out there. I see a stupa,
other people see a stupa, and you see a stupa. Since we all see it, we say,“There’s a stupa there.” The stupa that I see is an appearance of a stupafor my mind and the stupa that other people see is an appearance of astupa for their mind. And the stupa that you see is an appearance of astupa for your mind. So, there are these various appearances that arecommon or similar. We say that this comes about through similaractions, whereby similar sorts of predispositions have been accumulated,in dependence upon which similar sorts of appearances come about.To give an example: If somebody has jaundice, then they look at awhite conch and it appears to be yellow. If a second person also hasjaundice, they also look at that white conch and see that it appears tobe yellow. If a third person who has jaundice looks at it, then it appearsto be yellow for him too. So, all of these people who have jaundicelook at a white conch and it appears to be yellow; they all see a yellowconch. Then a fourth person who doesn’t have jaundice looks at it andsees that it is white. Now you have one person who sees a white conch
119
and three people who see a yellow conch. Who is right? Who is to say
what is true in this case? Well, in fact, it’s white, not yellow.
Question : But how can you assert that it is white? If it is just an
appearance of the mind, then how can you say that one is right andthe other is wrong? It is only an appearance. There is no true existenceto the white conch either.Rinpoche : The discussion of the conch is not a discussion of true
existence or the lack of true existence. It is a discussion about theappearance of white and the appearance of yellow. In using examplesto illustrate a point that is difficult to understand, it is necessary not toconfuse the example with the point exemplified by the example. So, inthe example one is discussing, using the example of jaundice in theway in which it affects perception of color, as a way to indicate howappearances vary for different individuals. Now, even within theexample the fourth person does not see the appearance of a yellowconch that appears to the first, second and third persons. The firstperson does not see the appearance of a white conch that appears tothe fourth person. Each person sees that which appears for themselves.When I see, for example, that stupa, there is an appearance for me. Idon’t see the appearance of the stupa that appears to another person’smind; rather, just as through having a similar illness there comes abouta similar misperception of the color of something, I see the appearancethat appears to me. This is an example that is given in terms of theworld, in terms that are acceptable to the world. The world alreadyunderstands that if a person’s eyesight is affected by an illness, then theillness is going to affect the way things will appear to that person. So,we are giving an example of something that is beyond the world interms of the world. We are saying that similarly, there is somethingthat is beyond that, beyond that which through the accumulation ofvarious latencies, predispositions, impressions and so forth whichremain with the mind, there come to be similar appearances such thatI see a stupa, you see a stupa, and other people see a stupa. But, in factthese are just individual appearances for the minds of individualpersons.A Detailed Examination of Dharma
120 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
Question : I didn’t really understand what you were saying about direct
perception of another person’s mind, whether one is in a state ofmeditation or whether one is not in a state of meditation. Would yougive an example?Rinpoche : The difference between the two is that the apprehension
directly of another person’s mind within meditative equipoise is as anaspect of one’s own samadhi, one’s own meditative stabilization.Whereas the apprehension of another person’s mind not from withinmeditative equipoise, its way of appearing, is just a likeness or areflection of one’s own mind.
Question : Would Rinpoche give an example? I can’t quite grasp the
meaning.Rinpoche : An example of not being within meditation would be the
way various appearances dawn within a dream; that is an example ofwhat it is like for just an aspect or a reflection of mind to appear assomething. An example of something from within meditative equipoisewould be like the way, when one practices meditation, one has varioussorts of experiences; it would be something like that.

CHAPTER  FOUR
A Detailed Examination of Dharmata
Dharmata of the Sutra Tradition
The understanding of dharmata can be gained either by the sutra
tradition or the mantra (Vajrayana) tradition. In the sutra
tradition, to abandon passion, aggression, conceptuality and so forth,emptiness is first taught. Next, it is pointed out that this emptiness isnot a mere nothingness, but that it has a quality of luminous clarity
(Tib. salwa ).
As we have discussed already, there are a variety of ways of indicating
that external and internal phenomena are not inherently existent. Oneprocedure is to demonstrate that external appearances are notestablished and, since external appearances do not exist in the waythat they seem to, therefore the consciousnesses that apprehend theseexternal phenomena and take them to truly exist are also false and aretherefore not truly established either.
Another approach is presented by the Middle-way school using
the logical arguments of dependent arising and the arguments ofphenomena not being one or many. Thus, it is shown that all external

122 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
phenomena and internal mind do not exist by their own nature, rather
they are inherently empty. This reasoning is called the Rangtongtradition or “empty-of-self school.” In this way, all phenomena arefound to be empty and through a path of reasoning we arrive at adefinite knowledge of phenomena as empty. By first generating adefinite belief that phenomena have the nature of emptiness, and joiningthat with the practice of meditation, this definite knowledge becomesgradually more and more clear, until we arrive at a direct perception ofemptiness. Proceeding in this way is extremely good; however, it takesa very long time.
While it is true that all impure phenomena have the nature of
emptiness, this emptiness is not a voidness or a mere nothingness, inwhich nothing whatsoever exists. Rather, it has the nature of luminousclarity, which is the basis for a Buddha’s wisdom (Skt. jnana ), for the
development of a Buddha’s omniscience. Emptiness is the ability forall phenomena to appear and to be realized. Therefore, in the sutrasand in the treatises it is referred to as “an emptiness that is endowedwith the supreme of all aspects,” meaning that it is suitable for allphenomena to appear, suitable for all phenomena to be known.
In the context of fruition, this state is called “a Buddha’s wisdom.”
In the context of ordinary, unenlightened beings, it is called “Buddha-essence (Skt. sugatagarbha ) or “the essence of the sugata” and is thus
regarded as a capacity or potential. This view of the Middle-way isreferred to as the “empty-of-other school” or Shentong  tradition which
contrasts with the previous discussed Rangtong tradition.
39 This factor
of luminous clarity is somewhat easier to meditate upon and thereforethe Shentong view is referred to as “that which joins the sutra andmantra traditions.”
Dharmata of the Mantra Tradition
In the tantra or the meditation in the Vajrayana, we do not realize
emptiness through the path of reasoning, but rather we take directperception as the path of meditation. This is done without consideringwhether external phenomena are empty or not, because it is difficultto meditate upon the emptiness of external phenomena. The
123
Vajrayana path emphasizes examining internal mind and looking
directly at this mind.
This mind is regarded then as being the form of dharmata itself.
As for the mind’s way of abiding, if we were to look, it would be easierto realize the nature of mind than the nature of emptiness presentedby way of the path of reasoning. It is relatively easier to understandand to realize that mind is not just a “dead” emptiness, but rather thatit has with it this factor of luminous clarity.
If we look for the ear consciousness, we don’t find anything; rather
there is simply emptiness and the factor of luminous clarity. Similarly,with the nose consciousness, that which experiences smells, and thetongue consciousness or the body consciousness, if we look for themthey can’t be found, rather there is just emptiness and luminous clarity.What about the sixth or mental consciousness which has all kinds ofthoughts and conceptions of good and bad, liking and disliking andso forth? When we look, there are indeed all kinds of thoughts anddiscursive activities. However, if we look for those thoughts themselves,or for the mental consciousnesses themselves by asking, “Is it insidethe body? Is it outside the body? Is it somewhere in-between? What isits form? What is its color or shape?” and so forth there is nothing todesignate and say “Aha, that’s it.” There’s nothing that’s found, there’snothing that’s seen. Why? Is it because we are not capable of findingsuch a thing? Is it because we don’t know how to look? No, that’s notthe reason. It’s because those thoughts have no nature of their own. Isit because our mind has somehow gone completely blank? No. Becausethe mind can realize things, therefore this sixth mental consciousnessis itself a union of emptiness and luminous clarity.
In terms of the sutra path, one proceeds by way of reasoning. In
terms of the mantra or Vajrayana, one proceeds by taking directperception as the path; arriving at a realization of the union of emptinessand luminous clarity and practicing in that way. Thus, Gampopa, said,“To know definitely: Look at your own mind.” This is to say that if welook somewhere other than our own mind, we will not find theauthentic view. If we look for the nature of our own mind, then wewill find the authentic view, that is, luminous clarity, emptiness, andA Detailed Examination of Dharmata
124 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
peacefulness, that which is called “the mind’s way of resting.” That
indeed is the view and what our mind is.
IV. T HE DETAILED  EXPLANATION  OF DHARMATA
A. A N OVERVIEW  OF THE SIX POINTS
18. Through introducing traits and a ground at all times,Definitive verification as well as encounter,Recollection and immersion into its core,This six-point approach to pure being is unsurpassed.
In this text, the nature of dharmata is taught in terms of six points or
six meanings, in terms of which one is able to enter into or engage indharmata. The six points are: (1) the definitive traits, (2) the ground,(3) definitive verification, (4) encounter, (5) recollection, and (6)immersion.
B. A D ETAILED  EXPLANATION
1. T HE DEFINITIVE  TRAITS
19. The defining traits in brief are just as they are.
The first aspect of dharmata is “the major or definitive characteristics
of dharmata.” The definitive characteristic of dharmata, or one couldsay, the nature of phenomena, were described earlier. The characteristicsof dharmata have four particular marks or aspects:
/wheel First it is free from an apprehended object,
/wheel second there is no apprehending subject,
/wheel third there is nothing that is expressed,
/wheel and fourth there is nothing that expresses.
125
What is the meaning of these four aspects? In many different places
the Buddha said that all phenomena are empty; however, just sayingthat isn’t sufficient. If one were to ask, “Does that word ‘emptiness’indicate accurately and fully the nature of phenomena, the way inwhich phenomena abide?” No, it doesn’t. “Does “luminous clarity”point out fully the way in which phenomena abide?” No, it doesn’t.Does “wisdom” point out accurately the final nature of things?” No, itdoesn’t. There isn’t a word that can properly describe dharmata. Forthat reason it is said that dharmata or the true nature of things isinexpressible, meaning that no matter what word one uses, one cannotexpress dharmata just as it is. If one attempts to think about dharmata,then it cannot be thought about accurately by the mind of an ordinaryperson. For that reason it is said to “have passed beyond the sphere ofthe minds of ordinary persons.”
For instance in a sutra in which Manjushri asked the Buddha,
“Do phenomena exist or do they not exist?” The Buddha replied byremaining silent. Some scholars have said that in saying nothing theBuddha indicated that the true nature of things is not something thatcan be expressed in speech.
On other occasions dharmata is referred to as “the object of the
activity of each individual person’s self-knowledge.” Taking this phraseapart, the Tibetan is rang-rig  or “knowing itself,” which means that
one looks at one’s own mind, not somewhere else. When it says that itis that way for each individual person, it means that it is not an externalthing that someone else can point to and say, “Oh, there it is. It is overthere.” Rather, it is something that each person has to see for himself.The person has to look at the nature of his or her own mind or thisdharmata. It is not something that can be shown by somebody else.
So, dharmata is characterized in terms of these four aspects: (1) it
lacks anything to be perceived; (2) it lacks a perceiver; (3) it cannot beexpressed; and (4) it is nothing that expresses.A Detailed Examination of Dharmata
126 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
2. T HE GROUND
20. The ground consists in the whole of phenomena
And supreme teachings, the whole of the sutra collections.
The second aspect of dharmata is called “ground” or “location” or
where we can find dharmata. Dharmata pervades all of samsara and allof nirvana. Dharmata is found in every single phenomenon. This iswhere dharmata is to be found in terms of objects of expression. Thenin terms of expressors, the way of abiding is found and taught in all ofthe sutras of the Buddha.
The teachings of the Buddha are very vast and extensive,
nevertheless if we summarize, we can say they have been gathered intowhat are called three turnings of the wheel of dharma . In the first turning,
the Buddha emphasized the teachings for the hearers (Skt. shravakas ),
where he presented methods for realizing the way in which phenomenaexist. In the second turning, the Buddha emphasized the teachings onemptiness and presented methods for realizing the way in which allphenomena exist, which is the dharmata. Then in the third turning,the Buddha emphasized Buddha-essence (Skt. sugatagarbha ), the union
of wisdom and emptiness, and the methods for realizing the way ofabiding (which is the dharmata). Thus, dharmata is discussed in all ofthe scriptures of the Buddha.
3. D EFINITIVE  VERIFICATION
21. The term “definitive verification of this”Refers to the whole of the path of application,Comprised of appropriate mental cultivationBased on the sutra collections of Mahayana.
The third aspect of dharmata is called “definitive verification.” This is
a discussion of the five paths  (Skt. marga ), the first of which is called
“the path of accumulation.” On the path of accumulation oneprincipally listens to and thinks about the meaning of the
127
Buddhadharma, and comes to understand its meaning. The next two
paths are called the “path of application” and the “path of seeing.” Atthis point one meditates upon the meaning that one has heard, thoughtabout and understood previously and one realizes the way in whichphenomena exist. Therefore, this is called “definitive verification.”
4. E NCOUNTER
22. The encounter attained because of authentic viewIs the path of vision, on which the suchness attainedIs in a fashion direct, whatever experienced.
The fourth aspect of dharmata is called rigpa  in Tibetan. Rigpa has
several meanings and the meaning of the word here is really just seeing,knowing, understanding. This is related to the third of the five paths,“the path of seeing.” By bringing what one has learned in the first twopaths into the practice of meditation, gradually one’s knowledgebecomes clearer and clearer, until one arrives at a direct perception ofdharmata. If one proceeds on the sutra tradition, one goes by way ofan ascertaining consciousness or definitive knowledge to the point ofit turning into a direct perception of dharmata. If one proceeds on theVajrayana path, one’s introduction to the way in which all things abidebecomes direct perception. One then meditates in terms of thatexperience and arrives at seeing or knowledge, which is the name ofthis fourth point; i.e., one knows and one realizes just how phenomenaactually abide. This is the point of achieving the genuine view.
5. R ECOLLECTION
23. Although reality has been seen by awareness,
Recollection – the path of meditation,Comprised of factors inducing enlightenment –Is needed to eliminate the stains.A Detailed Examination of Dharmata
128 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
The fifth aspect of dharmata is connected with the fourth “path of
meditation.” What is explained here is how one practices subsequentto the path of seeing. One practices in terms of remembering,recollecting or mindfulness of what one has realized or experienced atthe path of seeing. Rising from this direct realization of the dharmata,one knows that one has realized it, and this recollection or mindfulnessof dharmata is the understanding of dharmata. However, one does notjust remember it or think about it or be mindful of it; rather, onemeditates again and again and again, realizing dharmata in a directmanner. One progresses gradually towards enlightenment through suchpractice, abandoning the phenomena that are contrary toenlightenment.
6. I MMERSION
24. Here, immersion into its core complete,Is suchness rendered free of any stain,Where all appear exclusively as suchness –And this completes the transformation as well.
With the recollection of the fourth path, one arrives at the fruition.
This is the sixth aspect of dharmata and is called “thoroughtransformation.” One word within the Tibetan says it is somewhat asif one has changed the place where one dwells, in the sense that first ofall one began dwelling in samsara, among impure phenomena, butone has transformed that; leaving the impure behind, one dwells inthe pure. That is the sense of thorough transformation of one’s place.The actual name here, though, refers to the possibility of such atransformation. The point then is that the impure has been abandoned,the pure has been achieved and one sees the very nature of the dharmata.Having seen and then meditated upon it, one arrives at realizingdharmata as undifferentiable from one’s self. In fact, it has always beenundifferentiable from one’s self but has not been realized as such. Nowone has realized dharmata as undifferentiable from oneself and that
129
undifferentiability has become manifest. So, this then is referred to as
“immersion into dharmata.”
In The Uttaratantra  it says, “Sentient beings are Buddhas; however,
this is obstructed by the adventitious stains.” “Adventitious” meansthat it doesn’t need to be there, it doesn’t dwell in the very nature andso one can separate from it. So these adventitious defilements preventBuddhahood, and when they are cleared away, one arrives at dharmata,without being polluted or blocked by any defilement whatsoever. Thisis a thorough transformation and refers to achieving the final rank.
That explains the nature of thoroughly changing one’s place and
what it means to change one’s place completely and thoroughly. Anextensive explanation of transformation in ten points then follows inthe next chapter.
Questions
Question : Would Rinpoche explain the difference between the alaya
consciousness according to the Cittamatra and Shentong view?Rinpoche : The alaya consciousness that is explained by the Cittamatra
or Mind-only school is presented as the basis for impure, samsaricappearances. It is said that if there weren’t any such thing, then therewould be no basis for phenomena to dawn; there would be nothingthat could serve as a basis that would cause or enable various sorts ofappearances to dawn. Therefore, the Mind-only school says that theremust be such an alaya consciousness, a mind-basis-of-all; it mustundoubtedly exist and, in fact, it must be a truly existent phenomenon.
The Middle-way empty-of-other school (Shentong) does not have
such a conception. What they say is that all phenomena are empty ofinherent existence; there is no phenomenon, not even a single one,that is not empty of inherent existence. So all phenomena are empty.But that emptiness is not a mere nothingness, rather it is endowedwith the capacity for a Buddha’s wisdom, the potency or capacity for aBuddha’s omniscience, and in that way it is the essence of a Buddha’sall-knowing or omniscient awareness. It is therefore called “thesugatagarbha” or “the essence of the sugata” (“the essence of the onewho has passed into bliss”). It is not just some vapid or dead thing;A Detailed Examination of Dharmata
130 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
rather, it is a suitability for exalted knowing. That’s the difference
between the Mind-only school’s view and the view of the Middle-wayempty-of-other school. The difference comes about by way of the one(Mind-only school) not having realized emptiness fully and the other(Middle-way school) having realized it fully.
Question : Can Rinpoche please elaborate on luminous clarity?
Rinpoche : When we speak about luminous clarity, we are not really
talking about light, rays of light. We are not really talking aboutanything terribly profound. It just means the ability to know andunderstand that whatever there is can appear and can be seen, heard,smelled and understood. This quality of luminous clarity refers to theability for things to appear and to be known. It’s not something that’sa long way off. If you start looking for this knower, this luminous andclear entity, you don’t find anything. But, it’s not a long way off. It’svery close. It’s directly right there. It can be meditated on in that way.
Question : Rinpoche described having understanding and joining that
with meditation. In particular, in the fifth stage he described what youcall “recollection of experience or realization.” Are there times whenit’s recommended to have more meditation than other times? Are therestages on the path where it’s more appropriate to meditate moreintensely?Rinpoche : There are two different sorts of occasions. There is what is
called “meditative equipoise” or “setting the mind equally and evenly,in a level fashion within meditation.” For instance, the path ofmeditation is achieved at the point of the mind arriving one-pointedlyat a direct perception of dharmata, within such placement of the mindevenly and in a level manner within meditation. Then there is post-meditation, where one is subsequently mindful of what has been realizedand engages in various sorts of activities, working in the world. As fordiscriminating for oneself – when it is important to do which – if it ispossible for one to do something that is beneficial for others in termsof one’s work and actions in the world, when one can do that, thenone does so, and practices mindfulness of the view in terms ofsubsequent recollection. When it becomes apparent that it would be
131
possible for one’s experience to progress, to go further, to go to a higher
level, then that’s the time to focus on meditation.
Question : We speak of chö and chö nyi , dharma and dharmata in sutra,
and about sem and sem-nyid , mind and mind’s nature in the Vajrayana
or mantra tradition. Since in sutra we speak about the differentiationof dharma and dharmata, would it be okay in the mantra tradition todiscuss sem and sem-nyid ?
Rinpoche : It is not mistaken, but there is not a whole lot of discussion
or purpose in discussing it that way. What is the difference betweensutra and mantra? In the mantra Vajrayana tradition, one is notconcerned with a great deal of explanation of things, rather it is amatter of joining directly to meditation. Rather than bringinginferential cognition into the path, one takes direct perception as thepath, one brings direct perception to the path. So, there wouldn’t be apurpose or need for trying to set out carefully just what sems means
and just what nyid means. In the context of sutra, one is not talking so
much about internal mind, rather one is talking about external things;one is trying to understand or settle, to develop a path towards thetrue nature of such things, the difference between the way things appearand the way they actually exist. Thus, the analysis and discussion thatare presented in the sutras and the texts commenting on them arejoined principally to external things rather than to discussing the natureof mind per se. So, if one is focusing upon meditation, one considersand brings direct perception into the path. In the context of hearingand thinking, one considers and brings inference into the path.Generally therefore, even though there is nothing wrong aboutdiscussing the differentiation between mind and mind’s nature, sems
and sems-nyid , there is not a lot of purpose in doing it.
Question : How does one know that there is a dharmata that is not just
some sort of uncommon appearance?Rinpoche : Dharmata is something that has passed beyond, transcended,
gone further than either common appearances or uncommonappearances. If one approaches this from the point of view of reasoning,it is through seeing that both common appearances and uncommonA Detailed Examination of Dharmata
132 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
appearances are not established. They do not exist in the way that they
appear; i.e., one discovers that their nature or their entity is emptiness.In terms of meditation, if one looks within meditation directly at one’sown mind’s way of abiding and sees that, then this is not somethingmistaken. In the context of meditation, one knows. The realization ofdharmata is not a dawning of an appearance of any sort. It is somethingthat has passed beyond that.
Question : How do we know that the realization is not deluded?
Rinpoche : When one meditates, various sorts of experiences come
about, this, that and the other. Sometimes they are quite pleasurable,different sorts of things appear and are seen. However, those sorts ofthings are just occasional or temporary. What we are talking abouthere is something called “the mind’s way of abiding”; i.e., somethingthat goes through all of that. One sees that the mind is luminous andempty and this is not something that is made by one’s own mind;rather, in seeing it, one has a definite knowledge of that. This is called“introduction to the nature of mind.” It’s not just some sort ofexperience that comes along. It is seeing that which actually abides asthe nature of mind.

CHAPTER  FIVE
The Transformation of Dharma into Dharmata
B. THE DETAILED  EXPLANATION  OF TRANSFORMATION
A. A N OVERVIEW  OF THE TEN POINTS
25. This ten-point presentation of transformation
Provides an unsurpassable introduction,Because it is the way to approach the essence,Ingredients and individuals,The special traits, requirements and ground,Mental cultivation and application,The disadvantages and benefits.
The custom of expositions such as this is first to give a brief overview
of the topic and then to give an extensive, detailed explanation.
In the previous section there was the brief overview of the nature ofthe thorough transformation of state. We now give an extensiveexplanation, going through ten points serially: (1) the essence of thetransformation, (2) ingredients of the transformation, (3) an individual’s

134 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
transformation, (4) traits of the transformation, (5) realizing what is
required, (6) the foundation (ground) for the transformation, (7) mentalcultivation, (8) the levels through application, (9) the disadvantagesof no transformation, and (10) the benefits of transformation. Sinceeverything said in the brief indication is then explained extensively inthe following section, I think it is all right just to skip the brief indicationand go directly to the extensive explanation.
B. A D ETAILED  EXPLANATION
1. T HE ESSENCE  OF THE TRANSFORMATION
26. The essence of transformation is introducedAs suchness freed of stain, and what that meansIs superficial stains appear no longerAnd that which manifests is now the suchness.
The first aspect of dharma into dharmata is the nature of this
transformation of our state from an ordinary person into an enlightenedbeing. In The Uttaratantra  the word “tantra” refers to the continuity of
the Buddha-essence that is gradually purified from the state of anordinary sentient being to that of a bodhisattva to that of a Buddha.The Uttaratantra  says that a Buddha’s wisdom exists in all sentient
beings; however, it is not manifest. It does not manifest because of theadventitious defilements, which have the quality of being temporaryand are not part of or the nature of Buddha-essence. The defilementsare the disturbing emotions such as attachment or passion, aggressionor anger, and ignorance.
The Uttaratantra  describes Buddha-essence (Skt. sugatagarbha ) in
three aspects: that present in ordinary sentient beings, in bodhisattvas,and in Buddhas. In the first, impure state of an ordinary being, we aresaturated with disturbing emotions. When some partial purificationhas taken place, then we are at the state of a bodhisattva. And whencomplete purification has taken place such that the disturbing emotionshave been abandoned completely, then that is the state of a Buddha.
135
An example of this process would be like the sun first being
completely obscured by the clouds so that it is not seen at all. As thelayer of clouds becomes thinner, then sunlight becomes slightly strongeror slightly manifest. Finally, when the clouds have been burned awaycompletely, the sun is seen brilliantly and brightly. Similarly, theBuddha’s wisdom and the dharmadhatu
40 or “the sphere or element of
reality” is first not seen at all; later it is seen slightly, and finally, whenall stains have been cleared away, it is seen completely in all aspects.Just as the clouds are not part of the sun, so the disturbing emotionsare not part of Buddha-essence. So whether we refer to this assugatagarbha or dharmata, gradually the nature of this thoroughtransformation comes about.
41
2. I NGREDIENTS  OF THE TRANSFORMATION
27. To introduce the ingredients, or contents:Awareness in the form of the vessel sharedUndergoes a transformation to suchness;The sutras undergo a transformationInto the suchness, the actual dharmadhatu;And beings’ awareness-components not shared in commonUndergo a transformation to suchness.
This second aspect of the transformation of dharma into dharmata
concerns three topics: outer, various names that are given, and inner.These three topics have an implied order of body (appearances), speech(terms) and mind (thoughts).
/wheel First of all, there are external forms that are shared in common.
This is parallel to a previous discussion about the nature of externalphenomena, which are common or shared among various sentientbeings, and those that are uncommon or unshared. With regard tothose that are shared, we are speaking about the world that we inhabitas the container, with external phenomena such as mountains andbuildings making up the conventional world that serves as a container.The Transformation of Dharma into Dharmata
136 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
These external conventional truths all possess this quality of dharmata.
As for the way in which such things exist, the way these variousconventional truths abide is by the dharmadhatu, which is the lack ofinherent existence.
/wheel The second topic is that of the terms and meanings. The
Sanskrit term “dharmadhatu” (Tib. chö ying ), can be translated as “the
expanse of reality” or just “the expanse of dharma.” The meaning ofthe term dhatu  in Sanskrit and ying in Tibetan is that it cannot be
stopped by anything and pervades everything. A comparison fromamong ordinary sort of phenomena is space because space is somethingthat cannot be obstructed at all, so that it is possible to go absolutelyanywhere. Similarly, the nature of this dhatu or expanse is a suitabilityfor whatever good qualities might exist to come into existence, to begenerated, and a suitability for whatever faults exist to be abandoned.Since it is not an impure expanse but rather a pure one, it is referred toas “the expanse of dharma” or dharmadhatu.
In the situation of the impure, we have various sorts of names,
words, letters and so forth that are the means of expressing variousmeanings; they are the signifiers of that which is to be signified or theexpressor of that which is to be expressed. However, the nature of suchimpure phenomena (names, words and so forth) is a lack of inherentexistence. In the context of that which is final, then, we understandthe dharmata as manifesting as the various sutras, treatises and so forth,teaching emptiness or dharmata itself.
/wheel The third topic refers to various sorts of internal phenomena,
particularly the various elements within sentient beings such as theeight consciousnesses. What is indicated is the way in which impure,internal phenomena can be transformed into a Buddha’s wisdom.
Although there are no divisions within dharmadhatu itself, we
can make various divisions in terms of conventional phenomena. Interms of conventional phenomena, we classify dharmata into threedifferent divisions: the external, shared phenomena; speech thatexpresses and that is expressed; and internal phenomena of variousunshared states of consciousness.
137
In terms of the final effect, Buddhahood has three internal
divisions:
– The dharmakaya  or “truth body,”
– The sambhogakaya  or “complete enjoyment body,”
– The nirmanakaya  or “emanation body.”42
The dharmakaya refers to the way in which all phenomena exist.
The sambhogakaya is slightly coarser, and the nirmanakaya is so coarsethat it can be shown to all sentient beings. If we relate these to thethree aspects of dharmata, the shared phenomena – the vessel and byforce of that, everything appearing as bodies – at the point of thecomplete manifestation of dharmata, in terms of a thoroughtransformation, is the attainment of the dharmakaya. Next, by havingundergone complete and thorough transformation, the various sortsof expressive terms (speech) and expressed meanings (as exemplifiedby the sutras) manifest as the sambhogakaya. The nirmanakaya r efers
to the factor of luminous clarity, awareness and knowledge of themind (the eight consciousnesses). The transformation of these is atransformation into a manifest state as a nirmanakaya. Thus, if weare speaking about dharmata in terms of the result achieved at thefinal state, there is the manifestation as the three kayas  or “three bodies
of a Buddha.”
43
3. A N INDIVIDUAL ’S TRANSFORMATION
28. The approach as related to individuals:The first two of these are transformations to suchnessPertaining to Buddhas as well as to bodhisattvas;The last of these pertains additionallyTo Shravakas as well as Pratyekabuddhas.
The third aspect of the transformation of dharma into dharmata is
concerned with the activity of the three Buddha bodies or kayas.
/wheel The first, the dharmakaya of a Buddha, is accessible in the
sphere of activity only of a Buddha. Why is that? This is because theThe Transformation of Dharma into Dharmata
138 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
dharmakaya is the manifest state of the complete and thorough
transformation being utterly free from everything that is to beabandoned. It is a state in which all the good qualities have becomemanifest. For that reason, it is an object for the activity only of acompletely enlightened person, a Buddha.
Thus, the dharmakaya is spoken of as “the fulfilment of one’s own
welfare,” in that one has abandoned everything that is to be abandonedand one has generated all good qualities completely. Is the dharmakayaall that is needed? No, because one must achieve the welfare of others.Therefore, the dharmakaya by itself is not enough but needs to beable to display a form to other sentient beings. Therefore, there isthe display of the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya. Because theselast two kayas have an aspect of form, they are called rupakayas or“the form bodies.”
/wheel The sambhogakaya is displayed to those who have pure action
or pure karma, namely, the bodhisattvas. So the sambhogakaya revealsitself to the pure bodhisattvas. So, by way of the sambhogakaya thewelfare of bodhisattvas can be accomplished. However, this also isn’tsufficient because a Buddha needs to manifest to ordinary or impurebeings.
/wheel Therefore, to help others who have impure karma, the
nirmanakaya manifests. Thus, in order to teach students who are in animpure state, various emanation bodies or nirmanakaya forms aredisplayed.
In terms of teaching those who are in an impure state or have
impure action, it would not be suitable or particularly beneficial toteach them the extremely profound dharma, so ordinary beings aretaught the provisional meaning. Thus the nirmanakaya emanationsteach the paths of the Hinayana to shravakas and pratyekabuddhas.
4. T HE TRAITS  OF TRANSFORMATION
29. The introduction to traits especially advancedPertains to Buddhas as well as to bodhisattvas:The distinguishing trait of totally pure domains;
139
That which is gained through attaining the dharmakaya;
Sambhogakaya; as well as nirmanakaya –The insight, instruction and consummate mastery –Are attainments distinctively greater comparatively.
The fourth aspect of transforming dharma into dharmata discusses
the change of dharma into dharmata at the highest level of thistransformation. Generally speaking, when we are discussingtransformation it means a transformation from an impure state to apure state. Now we are discussing the point of having arrived at a purestate, by way of the first four of the five paths (the paths of accumulation,application, seeing and meditation), gradually the state is thoroughlytransformed until one arrives at what are called the pure bodhisattvalevels (the eight, ninth and tenth levels). So, what is being taught inthis topic is principally the pure levels of a bodhisattva and thepurification of the Buddha-field.
The three bodies of a Buddha teach or give dharma, enabling the
transformation from the impure to the pure state. Thus, one arrives atthe point of having the capacity to teach the excellent dharma to thosestudents who are to be trained, and in that way to enable their releasefrom samsara.
5. R EALIZING  WHAT IS REQUIRED
30. The introduction to realizing what is required:The distinguishing factor of previous wishing prayers;The distinguishing factor of Mahayana teachingAs focal point; and the further distinguishing factorOf effective application to all ten levels.
The fifth aspect of transformation of dharma into dharmata is the
purpose of this thorough transformation of our state. It goes back toour wishing prayers (Tib. mön lam ), and particularly, our former
aspirational prayers that we be able to accomplish the welfare of ourselfand the welfare of all other sentient beings as well. Beginning with theThe Transformation of Dharma into Dharmata
140 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
first bodhisattva level up to the tenth bodhisattva level and then finally
to fruition (which is Buddhahood itself), we gradually achieve ourown realization and we are able to help others as well. We arrive at thepoint of being able to teach the great vehicle or Mahayana and in thatway to achieve that which we have longed and had a great hope for.Our wish has now been realized and we can actually truly help bothourselves and all other sentient beings as well.
The sixth aspect of the transformation of dharma into dharmata
is very detailed so we will discuss this in the next talk.
Questions
Question : Are there various intelligences within dharmakaya or is it
one big mind?Rinpoche : In the various sutras and treatises there are many different
ways of teaching this, there are different ways of talking about it. Onsome occasions it is said that there is just one entity of wisdom and onother occasions it is said that there are various or different entities ofwisdom. There is a reason for speaking about it in different ways.When it is spoken of as being one entity of wisdom or one nature ofwisdom, that is from the point of view that within dharmakaya thereis no discrimination between self and other. However, it would not beaccurate to say that there is utterly no possibility of difference or nodifference because indeed there are individual Buddhas. We speak aboutthe 1000 Buddhas of the fortunate aeon; i.e., there are the Buddhas ofthe past, the Buddhas of the present, the Buddhas of the future and soforth. From that point of view there is individual wisdom.
Question : When you talk about the 1000 Buddhas of this fortunate
aeon, are you speaking more from the level of the understanding ofrelative truth?Rinpoche : When one speaks in that way about the 1000 Buddhas of
this fortunate aeon, what is being emphasized here is the emanationbody or nirmanakaya, whereby the welfare of sentient beings isaccomplished. However, that is not to eliminate the existence of such
141
within the realm of mind, in fact, within the entity of exalted mind
there are these various bodies of wisdom.
Question : Would it be correct to say that the dharmadhatu is the
expanse in which the dharmakaya manifests?Rinpoche : The word  ku in Tibetan, kaya in Sanskrit, “body” in English,
indicates a form such as a form of a human being that is displayed,dawns or appears. In Tibetan we distinguish between an ordinary wordfor body and an honorific term for body. This word ku being the
honorific term, we say that. In fact, when one speaks about the gradualmanifestation of the effect or fruit, one talks about it in terms of theachievement of such bodies or kayas. However, what is this thing? Infact, it refers to the realization of the way in which all phenomenaabide, the realization of dharmata. It refers to the manifestation ofthat manner of abiding. It refers to the abandonment of everythingthat is to be abandoned, all confusion, all mistakes whatsoever, thepurification of ignorance and the full flowering of all good qualities. Ithink it would be suitable to say that the effect or fruit is indeed achievedwithin dharmadhatu.
Question : It sounded as though sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya weren’t
natural or spontaneous things that came out of the dharmakaya. Itsounded as though a person could achieve all those qualities, yet maybethey wouldn’t be able to emanate, if that’s the proper word, thenirmanakaya form. I thought it was a spontaneous, natural occurrence.Rinpoche : There is no one who, despite having achieved dharmakaya,
is unable to accomplish the welfare of others. Through realizing thedharmadhatu, the expanse of reality, the expanse of dharma, one hasaccomplished one’s own welfare fully. This expanse of emptiness is,however, not a mere nothingness; rather, there is the factor of luminousclarity, in which the two forms of wisdom, the two aspects of a Buddha’swisdom manifest, dawn. Those two aspects are first of all what areknown as the knowledge of the mode of phenomena, the knowledgeof the way in which phenomena abide; i.e., the realization of the modeof abiding of all phenomena or realization of the final nature of allphenomena. Together with that there is the knowledge of the extent orThe Transformation of Dharma into Dharmata
142 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
variety of phenomena; i.e., sentient beings, the various conventional
phenomena that are endowed with or are the host for this quality ofdharmata. One understands that knowledge of the variety ofphenomena, one understands how confusion is born, theconsequences of such confusion, the means for separating fromconfusion and the various stages one goes through as one graduallyseparates from confusion, then the fruition that is achieved at thepoint of having separated from such confusion. This quality ofluminous clarity that is an aspect of dharmadhatu has threecharacteristics within it. These are the quality of knowledge, thequality of tender love, and the quality of potency so that it is possibleto display the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya and to enter intosuch a display both naturally and spontaneously.
Question : If the Shakyamuni Buddha was a physical being, how is it
possible for that physical being to function, for example to speak eachword that is expressed as a choice of all the possible words that can beexpressed? From the point of view of the dharmakaya, there is no basisfor this distinction.Rinpoche : Generally speaking, there are the two aspects of a Buddha’s
wisdom that I was just speaking about: the knowledge of the nature ofphenomena or the mode of phenomena and the knowledge of theextent or variety of phenomena. There is a reason for that. In the contextof the ultimate – i.e., the dharmadhatu – there is freedom from variousdistinctions. However, the dawning of appearances withindharmadhatu does not necessitate a change or transformation withindharmadhatu itself; rather, dharmas (phenomena) and dharmata (thenature of phenomena) abide together, they are equal. So, even thougha Buddha knows dharmata, this does not entail not knowing the variousphenomena that are endowed with the quality of dharmata. It doesnot entail that one does not know the extent of various appearances.In this way, various sorts of host of phenomena, so to speak, dawnclearly and are known without mixing them up, confusing one withanother or any sort of mistake or error. Thus when we speak about thefive wisdoms  of a Buddha, we speak about the wisdom of individual
realization, which refers to knowing each phenomenon distinctly and
143
clearly, such that one does not get confused in teaching, in giving oral
instructions to others, and there is no mistake.The Transformation of Dharma into Dharmata

CHAPTER  SIX
The Foundation for the Transformation of
Dharma into Dharmata
There are ten aspects of the transformation of dharma into dharmata.
The first five were covered in the previous chapter and we will
now discuss the sixth aspect of the transformation, which is non-conceptual wisdom in which wisdom refers to jnana (or yeshe in
Tibetan).
 
6. T HE FOUNDATION  FOR THE TRANSFORMATION
A. AN OVERVIEW  OF THE SIX POINTS
31. The introduction involving the ground or support
Is into original non-conceptual wisdomAs this is approached in a manner involving six points,Since the focal requirement, attributes surrendered,The correct way to apply the mind in practice,

146 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
The defining characteristics and benefits,
And full understanding are hereby introduced.
This verse is a brief summary of the whole topic of the foundation of
non-conceptual wisdom and within this topic there are six differentaspects or topics covered in the following detailed description: (1) Thefocal requirement, (2) abandoning unfavorable attributes, (3) stagesof meditation, (4) defining traits of dharmata, (5) benefits of non-conceptual wisdom, and (6) thorough knowledge.
B. A D ETAILED  EXPLANATION
(I). T HE FOCAL REQUIREMENT
32. The first of these, the focal requirement,Should be known to be introduced in four points,Since what is required is Mahayana teachings,Commitment to these, along with certitudeAnd fully completing the two accumulations.
The first of these six points of the foundation of the transformation of
dharma into dharmata concerns that which we observe or the “focalrequirement.” T o understand how we observe this non-conceptualwisdom, we need to study the Mahayana teachings, which is done infour stages.
/wheel The first stage is to listen to, that is, to study both the words
of the Buddha (the sutras) and also the commentaries (the shastras).After this, we need to engage in samadhi or “meditative stabilization”to thoroughly realize this non-conceptual wisdom. Thus, listening to,and thinking about the Mahayana dharma is presented as the cause.
As said earlier, the shastras are considered to be of greater
importance than even the words of the Buddha and the oral instructionsare of greater importance than the treatises. Others might think thatthe sutras, the words of the Buddha, would be most important; however,
147
the treatises are more important than the sutras. The oral instructions
are more important than the treatises and that needs to be wellunderstood.
/wheel The second stage of this foundation is called “admiration or
longing.” Having listened to the Mahayana dharma, we begin tounderstand the nature of phenomena. We recognize that it is not justsomething we know, but rather that it is extremely profound, beingthe cause that helps us and all others. Throughly understanding this,we begin to have great admiration and longing for it.
/wheel The third stage is developing a certainty of this non-conceptual
wisdom. There is the need for such longing and admiration, but thatalone is not adequate. In the sutras the Buddha gives the example ofgold. We do not just accept a person’s word that it is gold, but we mustcut it, heat it and thoroughly analyze it before we accept that it is trulygold. Similarly, if someone says, “this is the word of the Buddha” wemust analyze the teaching carefully determining if it is a provisionalteaching or a definitive teaching. We have to study it carefully to gaina definite understanding of it. We must come to understand it withoutany doubt, and for that reason to develop this third stage is called,“giving birth to definite discrimination.”
/wheel The fourth stage of understanding non-conceptual wisdom is
called “thoroughly completing the collections.” Having listened to theteachings and having generated a longing for them and then havingarrived at certainty of the meaning, we must practice, we must meditate,to develop a non-conceptual wisdom of it.
(II). A BANDONING  UNFAVORABLE  ATTRIBUTES
33. The second, which treats of surrendering attributes,Is also introduced by way of four points,Since what is unfavorable and the remedies,The suchness as well as the realization of thisAre attributes whose surrender leads the way.By doing this in respective order as follows –The Foundation for the Transformation
148 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
The coarse and the middling followed by those which
are fine,
And those which persist for a very long time indeed –These attributes are surrendered entirely.
The second point for the foundation of the transformation of dharma
into dharmata is abandoning or what is called “surrendering” that whichis unfavorable. What needs to be abandoned is that which is contraryto non-conceptual wisdom. There are actually four things that need tobe abandoned.
/wheel First we need to give up attachment to “those things needed
to be abandoned,” which are mainly the disturbing emotions, becausethese emotions are contrary to non-conceptual wisdom. This isespecially true for the disturbing emotion of ignorance which is theignoring of the way phenomena really are.
/wheel Second, we need to abandon attachment to the antidotes to
the disturbing emotions. In order to place our mind in an unfabricatedor uncontrived way within the true nature of phenomena attachmentto even the antidotes themselves also have to be abandoned.
/wheel Third, it is not adequate merely to abandon one’s attachment
to and conceptualization of objects such as desire and hatred or theantidotes to such objects of abandonment. But we must also abandonattachment to dharmata and conceptual discrimination with regardto dharmata.
/wheel Having overcome conceptualization and attachment to the
discordant phenomena, the antidotes to those phenomena, andsuchness itself, we must fourthly abandon even the perceivingconsciousness that realizes these things. Having realized suchness justas it is, having progressed along the various paths and having achievedfruition, one would still have attachment for the genuine view itself.So, one must abandon conceptualization and attachment with regardto the genuine view.
Having abandoned such apprehension of signs, even with regard
to the actual view, then the non-conceptual wisdom can becomemanifest.
149
The Procedure
There is a procedure for abandoning these four different things, so
this non-conceptual wisdom can manifest. The way we abandon thesefour things is done in terms of the most obvious or coarse to the subtlest,which corresponds to the four classes of attributes that need to beabandoned.
/wheel First, we recognize the disturbing emotions as something to
be abandoned. These are the obvious objects of abandonment and theeasiest to abandon.
/wheel Second, there are the remedies or antidotes to the disturbing
emotions and they are not themselves false; rather, they are goodqualities. We tend to regard them as important, so they are moredifficult to abandon because of our attachment to them. These areregarded as a more subtle class of attributes to be abandoned.
/wheel Third, there is suchness or dharmata itself, which is the way
in which all phenomena exists. Our attachment to it is subtler and isvery difficult to abandon being a very subtle attribute.
/wheel Fourth, there is realization of dharmata, realization of the
way in which all phenomena exist. Our conceptualization with regardto this realization and our attachment to it is extremely subtle anddifficult to abandon. This attachment is extremely subtle and persistsfor a long time.
(III). STAGES  OF MEDITATION  (AUTHENTIC  APPLICATION )
34. The introduction to practicing wisdom correctlyEntails the following four specific aspects:Practice involving something to focus on;Practice involving nothing to focus on;Practice involving no subject to focus on;Practice whose focus is nothing to focus on.The Foundation for the Transformation
150 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
The third point of the foundation for the transformation of dharma
into dharmata concerns how we actually apply ourselves to abandoningdharma for dharmata. The first two points (studying the Mahayanadoctrine and abandoning unfavorable phenomena) tell us how toabandon everything that goes against dharmata. Now in this thirdpoint we will examine how we do this or “correct applications,” whichalso have four stages.
/wheel At the beginning we are not able to apprehend non-conceptual
wisdom directly, so we must go by stages. So we begin at the first stagein which we focus on something, which is observing that all phenomenaare just mind only. Is the observation of all phenomena as being justmind sufficient? No, it isn’t sufficient by itself, therefore we must moveto the second stage.
/wheel In the second stage we do not focus our attention on anything
specific; this is a practice involving nothing existing that couldconstitute a perceived object on which to focus. This is called the“application of nothing to focus on.”
/wheel In the third stage we not only don’t focus upon anything but
there is no longer even a subject, there is no observer in relation tosomething to be observed.
/wheel Finally, in the fourth stage there is “nothing to focus on”
which means we see dharmata just as it is.
We must realize that this progression of stages (from objects of
observation being eliminated, then observing consciousnesses beingrefuted and passed beyond) does not lead us to a state of voidness ofbeing like a stone. That is not what is meant. This last stage of observingdharmata directly is one of “complete illumination” or full intelligenceand luminosity in which there is no darkness (or ignorance).
(IV). D EFINING  TRAITS  OF DHARMATA
35. The defining characteristics here encounteredShould be known to consist of the following three aspects,
151
In the transformation of dharma into dharmata we (1) had to study
the Mahayana teachings, (2) abandoned the unfavorable attributes,(3) entered into the stages of meditation, and (4) now in this fourthpoint we will discuss the characteristics of dharmata. We begin bygiving three different aspects of being in dharmata.
/wheel First we “abide in dharmata,” which means we rest in an
utterly uncontrived state.
/wheel Second, we rest in a state “devoid of appearance,” which
means there is an absence of dualistic conceptions of “I” and “other,”so there are no appearances. We are speaking about the state ofmeditation when placing our mind in an even, balanced, meditativestate. At the time of the paths of seeing and, principally within the pathof meditation, there is no appearance of visible forms, sounds, smells,tastes or tangible objects whatsoever; rather, only emptiness appears.
/wheel Third, “appearances appear to us to be like illusions.” Toward
the end of the path of the pure bodhisattva levels (eight through ten)and then Buddhahood itself, appearances dawn as illusions and not asthey did formerly, as real solid objects. Also indicated under this pointis the arriving at Buddhahood itself, where there is a complete mixingof appearance and emptiness.
36. Since one effect is repose in pure being,
Which means that one actually settles in pure being,The non-dualistic and inexpressible;
Now to consider these three in more detail.
The first aspect of being in dharmata is called, “reposing in pure
being.” We are speaking about resting or dwelling in dharmata itself,in the way that dharmata actually abides. We are relying upon thesutra presentation, rather than the Vajrayana presentation. In the sutratradition, we first determine just how all phenomena exist. With thisdefinite knowledge, we gradually move into this samadhi called “ameditative equipoise.” In this meditation we realize the emptiness ofexternal phenomena and the internal mind. So, this is the way in whichthe definitive character of resting in dharmata is done.The Foundation for the Transformation
152 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
37. And one effect relates to appearances’ absence,
Where duality, assumption and formulation,Faculties, objects, principles of awareness,And vessel-like worlds’ appearances are absent;So these correspond to there being no observation,No description, no ground and no appearances,No principles of awareness, and no place,Which is how the sutras express the traitsDefining original non-conceptual wisdom;
The second aspect of being in dharmata is called “devoid of
appearance.” This is a discussion of the absence of appearances at thetime of non-conceptual realization. This is taught in terms of the non-appearance of the six objects or stages of perception as follows.
(1) The five doors. Because of the way our sense organs function,
there arises a dualistic appearance of the object which is perceived andthe perceiver. However, there is no such dualistic appearance by wayof the consciousnesses that operate through the five doors  of the eye,
ear, nose, tongue and body.
(2) Mental consciousness. There is no appearance of the sixth,
mental consciousness, which is conceptual.
(3) Sense powers. There is no apprehension of sense powers
themselves, the physical bases that allow various consciousnesses andobjects to meet.
(4) The five objects. There is no appearance of the five objects
themselves (visible forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects).
(5) The six consciousnesses. The six consciousnesses themselves
(eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind) do not appear.
(6) The world and the beings. There is no appearance of the world,
the vessel or container, and the essence or inhabitants who dwell withinthis world.
In summary, when we are able to reach a state where we no longer
see or “apprehend” appearances, what we apprehend is their non-appearance within the nature of emptiness, their lack of any nature oftheir own. In terms of “no observation,” “no description,” “no ground,”“no appearance,” “no principles of awareness,” in the root text, the
153
first that of of “no observation,”44means the absence of dualistic
appearances or the absence of adding on something that isn’t there.“No description” means the absence of any conceptual mind: beingunable through speech ever to show them to someone else, one couldnot demonstrate them to others by saying this or that about them.The phrase “no ground” means they are without a source, in the sensethat within meditative equipoise of non-appearance one understandsthe emptiness of the sense powers themselves, the sense powers thatwould serve as the sources for various consciousnesses. The phrase “noappearance” means the non-appearance of the six objects just discussed.
This discussion originates in a sutra by the Buddha, in which he
demonstrates six ways in which there is no appearance within meditativeequipoise. “No principles of awareness” points to the absence of thesix consciousnesses when one has realized dharmata. Finally, the non-appearance of the world and its inhabitants points to the absence of aplace, “no place” in the text: i.e., one sees from the point of view of thenon-establishment of the world and its inhabitants. All six of thesequalities are in the sutras of the Buddha.
45 We are in the discussion of
the yoga of non-appearance or the yoga, which is without appearance.It is said that if one were to give an example, it would be like lookingat the center of space.
46 That is the characterization of the yoga, that it
is without appearance.
38. And one effect relates to appearances’ presence,
Since experience of every phenomenonIs equivalent to the center of open space,And formations all are appearances like illusions.
The third aspect of being in dharmata is called “possessing appearance,”
in which we perceive all phenomena as being like illusions. Even thoughphenomena are empty, when we arise from meditative equipoise (Skt.samadhi ), the yoga of non-appearance – i.e., during post-meditation –
there is the arising of appearances. This refers to the apprehension ofbodhisattvas, particularly at the times of the path of seeing andmeditation. This means that at this level, having entered into the yogawithout appearances, all phenomena arise in the mind as an illusion;The Foundation for the Transformation
154 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
the appearances which seem solid and real to ordinary beings, appear
as illusion to the bodhisattva at this level.47 At the highest, tenth level,
of a Buddha, we attain the wisdom of the nature of phenomena (Tib.ji ta ba ) and the wisdom of the variety of phenomena (Tib.  ji nye pa )
by seeing how these phenomena appear to other sentient beings.
48
(V). T HE BENEFITS  OF NON-CONCEPTUAL  WISDOM
39. The four points introducing the benefitsInclude the complete attainment of dharmakaya,Attainment of bliss which nothing can exceed,Attainment of mastery over the power of insight,And attainment of mastery over the power to teach.
The fifth point is the benefits of having realized non-conceptual
wisdom. There are four such benefits.
/wheel The first benefit that is achieved through non-conceptual
wisdom is the dharmakaya in a complete form. In saying oneaccomplishes this complete form, there are two aspects. One is theaspect of abandonment and the other is the aspect or realization.
Abandoning refers to abandoning the obstructions of the
disturbing emotions and also abandoning the obstructions toknowledge or omniscience. So two obscurations are abandoned.
Realization refers to achieving the two qualities of a Buddha’s
wisdom: the knowledge of the nature of phenomena and the knowledgeof the varieties of phenomena.
/wheel The second benefit is called “great happiness” (Skt. mahasukha ).
It is achieving a happiness that is greater than all others. Normally, thehappiness that we have is quite changeable and not very stable. Thegreat happiness or bliss that we achieve at this point is stable andunchanging.
/wheel The third benefit is that one sees everything in an unerring
way, thus it is said that one achieves mastery with regard to insight.
155
/wheel Finally, after having achieved mastery with regard to insight,
we are able to teach the correct path to others without teaching anythingincorrectly or mixing anything up. So, the fourth benefit is that weachieve mastery with regard to teaching.
(VI). T HOROUGH  KNOWLEDGE
A. AN OVERVIEW  OF THE FOUR POINTS
40. The introduction to thorough understanding
Should be known to include the following four points:A full understanding regarding the remedy;A full understanding regarding the characteristic;A full understanding regarding distinctive marks;And a full understanding regarding the five effects.
This is the brief explanation of the four topics of what is called
“thorough knowledge”: (1) fully understanding the remedy, (2) fullyunderstanding the characteristic, (3) fully understanding the distinctivemarks, and (4) fully understanding the five effects.
B. A D ETAILED  EXPLANATION
(I) FULLY UNDERSTANDING  THE REMEDY
41. What is to be understood as the remedy hereIs non-conceptualizing original wisdom,Since perceiving phenomena, individuals,An alteration as well as dichotomy,Denial as well, when this is entertained,Are five distinct forms of perception of non-existentsFor which it is taught to comprise the remedy.The Foundation for the Transformation
156 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
The first from among the four topics is the way in which the objects of
abandonment are to be abandoned. This is done by the way in whichsomething can serve as an antidote. This is discussed in relation to anantidote to the suffering we experience, the disturbing emotions andobscurations which are the source of negative actions in which weengage and which lead to suffering. What is it that could purify those?It is non-conceptual wisdom that can remove our confusion and istherefore the antidote to them.
How is it that non-conceptual wisdom serves as the antidote to
our disturbing emotions and delusions of all sorts? It is like this; if weare trying to identify the root of all disturbing emotions, it comesabout in this way. There are various sorts of mistaken appearances assamsara and confusion about those appearances. These appearancesappear; however, these appearances are not actually established in theway that they appear. Nevertheless, through our confusion we conceiveof them as real things, as truly existent things. For instance, we becomeattached to and generate conceptual discriminations with regard toexternal appearances and think this is desirable and that is not. Similarly,we incorrectly regard internal phenomena, such as our thoughts andfeelings, as constituting a self. Therefore, we must abandon thesemisconceptions of truly existent phenomena and a self. What is it thatserves as the antidote to those conceptions of a self and truly existentphenomena? It is non-conceptual wisdom that serves as the antidoteto those conceptions.
We speak about something that is called “complete change.” This
is in the context of discussing the appearance of things, of theirfunctioning, and the conceptions of those appearances as indeed beingsuch things. When we conceive in that way, we are regarding the selfand external objects as permanent in the sense of not changing frommoment to moment. The misconception of believing phenomena arepermanent is a great mistake and denotes great confusion. It is aconception of self. From that point of view, recognizing that phenomenaare indeed changeable and impermanent is quite helpful in leading usin the direction of dharmata. So, it is helpful to recognize phenomenaas impermanent rather than as permanent. Nevertheless, to conceivethat phenomena are newly produced and then cease is to be mistaken
157
about their ultimate mode of abiding, their ultimate nature. Because
in fact, the ultimate nature of phenomena is that they lack inherentexistence. From that point of view, it is not accurate to say that theyare produced at some point, have a nature of impermanence and latercease. T o regard them as permanent and then impermanent is called “aconception of phenomena as changeable.” This conception needs tobe abandoned.
Generally speaking, there are “phenomena” or “host phenomena”
and “dharmata” or “the nature of phenomena.” We tend to regardthese as being separate, different things. When we begin to understandthat phenomena have the nature of emptiness, we may begin to regardconventional appearances and ultimate emptiness as being separate, asbeing different. If we regard the conventional and the ultimate asseparate and being contrary to one another, we have not realizedemptiness accurately. Thus this conception of phenomena and theirnature being separate is a conception that is to be abandoned.
The next misconception that needs to be abandoned is called
“deprecation,” meaning that we take emptiness of inherent existenceto mean utter non-existence. We do not understand that emptiness isa suitability for dependently arising phenomena to appear. This ideaof emptiness being utter non-existence is a mistaken deprecation. Thecorrect realization of the non-conceptual wisdom serves as an antidoteto such a misconception of emptiness.
We have identified five different misconceptions to which this
non-conceptual wisdom serves as the antidote. These are: (1) a self ofphenomena, (2) a self of individuals, (3) the misconception concerningthe change that phenomena undergo, (4) the misconception that theconventional and the ultimate are separate or different, and (5) themisconception that emptiness denotes utter non-existence. Now wemove on to the second among the four topics of thorough knowledgeor full understanding.The Foundation for the Transformation
158 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
(II) FULLY UNDERSTANDING  THE CHARACTERISTIC
42. Fully understanding the characteristic:
A lack of the process of thought and correct transcendence,Tranquilization, things in their composition,And predetermination are the fiveThe exclusion of which is the concrete characteristic.
The second topic concerns the definitive characteristic of non-
conceptual wisdom. Generally speaking, non-conceptual just meansan absence of conceptuality; however, there are a variety of ways inwhich it can be understood. So this topic tries to clarify what non-conceptual wisdom is and also gives examples of what non-conceptualwisdom is not.
There are many different states that are regarded to be non-
conceptual or free from mental activity. However, not all of those statesare wisdom. For example, there are mental states free from graspingand conceptualization that are not states of non-conceptual wisdom.Here the text indicates five; in particular, what someone might mistakeor take to be the meaning of non-conceptuality and freedom fromgrasping and conceptualizing activity. Something other than these fiveis what is intended here.
/wheel The first characteristic of non-conceptual wisdom is called
“no mental application.” What this refers to is states in which there isan absence of a very coarse conceptuality. This conceptuality is one inwhich a person is involved with various sorts of conventionaldesignations that are set up by the world: i.e., conceptions that mixnames and objects. For instance, an infant lacks that sort ofconceptuality. In the books it says, “conception that regards terms andobjects as suitable to be mixed;” by “terms” is meant various names forthings and by “objects” is meant various sorts of functioning things inthe world. Coarse conceptuality functions in this manner: it seemsfine to put the name of something and the thing together, to just sortof paste them together. Now, a small child does not have such
159
conceptuality, but the absence of that sort of conceptuality is not what
is meant by non-conceptual wisdom.
/wheel The second characteristic of non-conceptual wisdom is called
“correct transcendence.” By practicing tranquility meditation, we candevelop “the four concentrations” that are the aspects of the form realm.In the first concentration we pacify a rough sort of examination called“investigation.” To achieve the second concentration we pacify a moresubtle type of examination called “analysis.” From the secondconcentration onwards, we have pacified that sort of rough and subtleinvestigation and analysis respectively; they have been pacified and wehave passed beyond them. However, that does not amount to the non-conceptuality we call “non-conceptual wisdom” on this occasion. Themeditative concentrations and this non-conceptual wisdom are differentin nature.
/wheel The third characteristic called “thorough pacification” might
be mistaken for non-conceptual wisdom. What is indicated here arevarious states in which conceptuality has ceased as if it had been knockedout. For instance, when we enter into a very thick or deep sleep, thereis very little conceptuality. However, such deep sleep is not what ismeant by non-conceptual wisdom. Similarly, there is a meditative statethat is called “the meditative absorption of cessation” in which oneenters into a completely mindless state. It’s as if consciousness hascompletely stopped; there’s no factor of luminous clarity whatsoever,as if one’s mind has just been cancelled. However, that’s not what ismeant by non-conceptual wisdom, because non-conceptual wisdomrealizes the way in which all phenomena abide: i.e., the dharmata, andthe above mentioned states are not a case of realizing that dharmata.
/wheel The fourth characteristic that might be taken to be non-
conceptuality is various things that are indeed non-conceptual, forinstance, visible forms, sounds, smells, tastes and tangible objects suchas stones and buildings. Indeed, these phenomena have noconceptuality, but that’s not what is meant by non-conceptual wisdomwhich has the nature of prajna or “intelligence.” Non-conceptualwisdom has a factor of luminosity or clarity, whereas materialphenomena don’t have this.The Foundation for the Transformation
160 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
/wheel The fifth mistaken understanding of non-conceptuality is
called “predetermination” or “a conception of manifest signs.” Forexample, when the Indian master Kamalashila traveled to Tibet todebate with the Chinese master Hashang, he found that Hashang wastelling his students, “I teach a sudden path. Up to this point you havebeen practicing a gradual path, but this sudden path that I’m presentingis better. The way it is better is like this. Whether you have whiteclouds in the sky or black clouds in the sky, they both block the sun.Similarly, whether you have virtuous thoughts or non-virtuousthoughts, both are obstacles and for that reason this is the meditationthat you ought to practice,” Hashang was saying to abandon allthoughts, virtuous and non-virtuous, whatsoever. If we were talkingabout the practice of Shamatha, then what Hashang taught is fine.However, there is no aspect of Vipashyana or “insight” in that kind ofmeditation because underneath is the conception, “I must hold mymind without any thoughts whatsoever.” Non-conceptual wisdom haspassed beyond that state entirely.
So the non-conceptual wisdom that we are describing is non-
conceptual in a rather different way from the five different non-conceptual states just described. All of these five do indeed satisfy themere meaning of non-conceptual, but they are not non-conceptual inthe sense of wisdom because wisdom passes far beyond such states,since those states have not realized the dharmata. Non-conceptualwisdom is a direct perception, a realization of dharmata, not just somesort of cessation in the way material phenomena are non-conceptual.
(III) FULLY UNDERSTANDING  THE DISTINCTIVE  MARKS
43. Completely understanding its marks refersTo its being free of conceptualization as such,To the fact that it is not transitional,To its not remaining while being there all along,And its hallmark of being completely unexcelled;These make up its five distinctive marks.
161
There are five superior features of non-conceptual wisdom:
/wheel First, it is free of conceptualization. It does not involve any
conception of samsara as something that is to be abandoned and nirvanaas something that is to be taken up. Rather, non-conceptual wisdomhas transcended these conceptions.
/wheel Second, it is not trivial. Rather, it is realization of the final
nature of all phenomena, realization of how all phenomena exist, andthereby it enables the discarding of what is to be abandoned and therealization of whatever is to be realized, the completion of all goodqualities. In that way, it is not trivial.
/wheel Third, it does not abide in any extreme of existence – i.e.,
samsara – nor any extreme of peace – i.e., nirvana. It is not a case ofbeing confused and therefore bound in samsara nor is it a case of beingfrightened and therefore seeking release into nirvana. It is not coveredby any of those faults; rather, it is the source of great benefit to allsentient beings. It is said that non-conceptual wisdom does not abideeither in existence or in peace.
/wheel Fourth, it is stable. Non-conceptual wisdom has not been
manufactured by one’s own mind, and from that point of view thefourth feature of superiority is, it is said to be steady or stable: i.e.,having realized in this way the way in which all phenomena abide, onedoes not later fall back into confusion. In that sense, when we regardthe dharmakaya as the fruition or effect, we can say that it is a permanententity or permanent nature in the sense that there is no falling backfrom it into confusion.
/wheel Fifth, this non-conceptual wisdom is not surpassed by anything
else. It is not the case that when one has arrived at such non-conceptualwisdom there is some further destination to which one needs to go;rather, this is the final accomplishment and there is nothing else thatneeds to be accomplished; there is nothing beyond it.
So, these are the five features of distinctive superiority of non-
conceptual wisdom.The Foundation for the Transformation
162 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
(IV) FULLY UNDERSTANDING  THE FIVE EFFECTS
44. The last, the full understanding of its effects,
Includes its lasting effect on conceptualization;Its affording unsurpassable happiness;Its effecting elimination of obscurations –Afflicted emotions and cognitive obscurations;The original wisdom attained in the wake of thisProvides the access to every aspect of knowledge;It enables achieving attunement with Buddha-fieldsAnd thorough maturation of sentient beings,And brings about revelation and transmissionOf knowledge which is complete in every aspect;These five are the special features of the effects.
The fourth topic of non-conceptual wisdom is called “the activity of
non-conceptual wisdom.” Having realized the dharmata our confusionis overcome and our conceptuality is cast far away; i.e., it is justdestroyed. When we talk about the way in which various causes leadto effects we talk about five different types of effects.
/wheel The first effect of overcoming conceptuality is called “an
effect that is made by a being” in somewhat the way that a craftsmancould actually make something, so there is some similarity in that thisnon-conceptual wisdom simply destroys conceptuality. From that pointof view, one could regard the abandonment of conceptuality as aneffect that has been made by a being.
49
/wheel The second effect of this non-conceptual wisdom is called
“unsurpassable happiness,” which is happiness that is beyond change.In an ordinary way we have various experiences of happiness andpleasure; however, they deteriorate and then suffering comes, so thereis a great deal of change. However, when one has separated fromconceptuality by way of non-conceptual wisdom, then one’s mind doesnot fluctuate. From that point of view, one has achieved anunsurpassable happiness and unsurpassable pleasure. Because it is thevery nature of the situation, because it is a nature that is itself pleasant,it is said to be a dominant effect from among these five types of effects.
163
/wheel The third effect is the elimination of obscurations. Having
realized the way in which all phenomena exist and having given birthto non-conceptual wisdom, then those phenomena that are to beabandoned are indeed abandoned and one’s obscurations with regardto the dharmata are overcome. From that point of view, it is said thatthe obstructions to knowledge or the obstructions to omniscience havebeen overcome; one has separated from them. Obstructions toomniscience ( cognitive obscurations ) on this particular occasion mean
dualistic perception, conceiving things, conceiving of existentphenomena. From that point of view, we could say that all of ourthoughts whatsoever, all of this conceptuality is an obstruction toknowledge or obstruction to omniscience. In dependence upon suchconceptions coming forth in a much more coarse or gross way, thisleads to the more coarse conceptions of various sorts of afflictedstates (disturbing emotions or kleshas) or the obstructions toliberation. However, this non-conceptual wisdom destroys both ofthese obstructions, the obstructions to omniscience and theobscurations to liberation. It enables one to part from them. Fromthat point of view, in our discussion of different sorts of effects, thisparticular effect of non-conceptual wisdom is called “separativeeffect,” in the sense that these twofold obstructions are abandonedthrough the force of that wisdom.
/wheel The fourth type of effect is called “an effect that accords with
the cause.” This non-conceptual wisdom sees dharmata and by way ofthat non-conceptual wisdom abides inseparably with phenomena andknows their final nature; it sees dharmata. It sees all objects of knowledgeand, as we saw before, this is in the manner of the two aspects of aBuddha’s wisdom, wisdom knowing the nature or mode of phenomenaand wisdom knowing the variety or extent of phenomena. So, fromthis point of view of seeing the nature of all phenomena and abidinginseparably with them in this way, it is said to be an effect that accordswith its cause.
/wheel The fifth effect is the function, the activity of this non-
conceptual wisdom, called “thorough ripening.” This is in the sensethat by way of this non-conceptual wisdom one purifies the Buddha-field in which one will become a Buddha and teach sentient beings.The Foundation for the Transformation
164 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
This does not just purify such a Buddha field, but it ripens sentient
beings who have faith; it naturally ripens them. Moreover, it bringssentient beings into the good path of the dharma in the sense ofbestowing the dharma to sentient beings. Thus, from this point ofview it is said that this non-conceptual wisdom has the three qualitiesof purifying, ripening and completing the welfare of sentient beings.This is what “thorough ripening” means.
Questions
Question : When one directly realizes the ultimate, does that mean
that conventional phenomena just become non-existent or go away?Rinpoche : As for conventional appearances, for beginners indeed when
in this state of meditative equipoise in which the mind is set evenly,fully and in a balanced manner upon the ultimate, such conventionalappearances do disappear. However, when the dharmata has becomefully and completely manifest, they do not. Finally, just while thingsare empty they appear and right when they appear, just when theyappear, they are at that time empty. If it were not that way, then itwould be the case that emptiness on the one hand and appearance onthe other were contrary. Are those two contrary? No, they are not. It isthus not necessary that the dawning of one entails the disappearanceof the other. T emporarily as one is moving along the path that is thestate, but in the end no, they dawn together.
Question : Are the states of Shamatha not to be confused with non-
conceptual wisdom when it comes to investigation and analysis? Wouldyou say something about what is being investigated and analyzed andfaults that can arise?Rinpoche : There is a factor of investigation and analysis in all
conceptuality. In the sutras it is said that investigation is togpa and
analysis is jöpa. The former, which is called “investigation,” is of a very
coarse sort. An example of that would be from a distance you are notsure whether something is a pile of stones or whether it is actually ahuman being; it’s hard to tell. You are way off and wonder, “Is itsomebody or is it just some stones that look like a human being?”
165
That’s what we mean by coarse investigation. Whereas, detailed analysis
means coming up closely and looking very carefully, saying, “Well, isit or isn’t it?” The sort of meditative stabilizations or samadhi, whichwe are speaking of in this particular context (the states of concentrationstarting with the second concentration on up from there) are free fromsuch coarse investigation and detailed analysis; rather, one simply abidesin a luminous and clear state in which those are absent.
Question : Does that mean that if one were abiding in the luminous
and clear state, one wouldn’t look to see whether there was a pile ofstones or a human being? One would just rest in not knowing?Rinpoche : Yes, that’s exactly what it means. One would rest without
investigating or analyzing external phenomena, rather one would simplydwell in a peaceful state within meditation. Now if we were talkingabout the meditation of the secret mantra-Vajrayana, such meditativepractices are not much concerned with these four concentrations. Onedoesn’t not perceive in terms of such a series of meditations or suchstages of meditation, rather one cultivates a factor of stability, and theintroduction to the nature of the mind comes in terms of such a factorof stability. In the sutra tradition, however, there is a great deal ofdiscussion about those four concentrations and the way in which oneproceeds through them, by way of them, to realization of the finalnature of things. However, here in this context, in terms of what oneactually practices in Vajrayana practice, one does not proceed in thatway; rather, a mere Shamatha is adequate, and the introduction to thenature of mind is made in terms of that mere factor of stability.The Foundation for the Transformation

CHAPTER  SEVEN
Mental Cultivation in the
Transformation of Dharma into Dharmata
The discussion of how one’s state is thoroughly transformed from
dharma to dharmata is enumerated in ten different topics. This
transformation is achieved through mental cultivation or we could saymeditation. Up to this point we have discussed six of these topics andnow we will begin with the seventh.
7. M ENTAL  CULTIVATION
45. The introduction to mental cultivation:For individuals wishing to cross the thresholdInto original non-conceptual wisdom,For any bodhisattva, Awakening Hero,Here is how to cultivate the mind.
46. By virtue of one’s ignorance of suchness
The “store of all seeds” of what is unreal, mere invention,

168 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
Is the cause for two which do not exist to appear;
And, with that as the base, there are grounds for     diversification,Due to which the cause and effects as well,In spite of appearing, still do not exist.With that appearing, pure being does not appear;Through that not appearing, pure being indeed appears.Through such cultivation of mind, when properly done,The Bodhisattva steps across the brinkInto original non-conceptual wisdom.
47. Through focusing thus, mere awareness is focused on,
Through which there are no referents to focus on;
Through there being no referents that could be focused on,There is no such mere awareness to focus on;Through that not existing on which to focus, the vergeIs crossed into focusing free of this twofold division;
48. No split into two existing on which to focus,
This is original non-conceptual wisdom,Since this is what is defined with the utmost precisionAs that which involves no object, no focusing,No attributes on which to focus at all.
Mental cultivation deals with how something is changed, its condition
before the transformation and the way in which the transformationtakes place.
Those bodhisattvas who wish to meditate on non-conceptual
wisdom need to understand that we wander in samsara because we donot understand how phenomena exist and we need to understand realityor dharmata to achieve liberation.
Ordinary persons who do not understand dharmata, i.e., the way
in which all phenomena exist, become involved with that which is nottrue. This is how they enter into confusion and the reason why mistakenappearances arise for them.
169
Our mind has a nature of emptiness; nevertheless, it is at the same
time very clear, extremely luminous and unceasing. Because of thisluminous clarity, various thoughts arise and we therefore becomeinvolved in confusion. It’s like a drawing or painting. Generallyspeaking, we do not mistake a painting for the object portrayed in thepainting. However, if the painting is extremely good our eyes can bedeceived and gradually, as we become more and more accustomed andinvolved with it, we take the painting to be real, to be what it actuallyportrays and appears to be. In the same way, the very vivid clarity ofour own mind leads to our confusing appearances with something realand we become involved in confusion.
Our mind as empty is homogenous, without differentiation.
However, mind as luminous clarity has differences, namely, the eightconsciousnesses.
50 The foundation of these eight consciousnesses is
the eighth, the alaya consciousness. In the words of the root text here,this is referred to as “the store of all seeds.” This refers to the fact thatthe various predispositions or latencies have entered this alayaconsciousness and later they return as various appearances. If thesepredispositions that have entered the alaya consciousness are good,then the appearances to the mind will, accordingly, be something good.If, on the other hand, these predispositions are of a negative nature,then the appearances to which they give rise are ugly and painful innature. So, the root of all appearances is this alaya consciousness.
In dependence upon this alaya consciousness, confusion comes
about when the six consciousnesses make contact with the six types ofsensory expressions – sight, sound, smell, etc. This contact of theexternal object and the internal consciousnesses causes appearances toarise. Even though phenomena are empty, there are no externalapprehended phenomena or internal apprehending consciousnesses,from the alaya consciousness all these appearances arise.
So, first there is no inherent existence; there is no existence by way
of own nature. Then there is the alaya consciousness. From the alayaconsciousness come the six types of knowers or consciousnesses andthe various appearances that dawn in the face of those knowers.However, in regard to their nature, those appearances are not trulyestablished and for that reason they are called “mistaken.”Mental Cultivqation
170 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
When these appearances are mistaken for being real, i.e., not empty
which is their true nature, confusion of samsara arises. Through thedawning of those mistaken appearances and being confused, at thattime the dharmata does not appear. However, if the true nature ofthese appearances is realized to be empty, i.e., as dharmata, it appears,these mistaken appearances are abandoned and the bodhisattva developsor enters into non-conceptual wisdom.
The discussion above of appearances in contrast to dharmata is
given in the way it is presented in the sutras. On this path theemptiness of phenomena is realized through extensive analyticalreasoning. In the Vajrayana, particularly in Mahamudra andDzogchen meditation, we go about this differently, by using directperception of mind. In the Vajrayana we do not emphasize externalappearances, but rather look at internal mind. This method does notrequire extraordinary exertion of many eons or many lifetimes ofpractice; rather we look at dharmata as undifferentiated from ourown mind. In this system external appearances are not negated, asthey would be by another path.
In the meditation of the Vajrayana appearances are not negated.
In this text, it says that when dharmata is seen, then the variousappearances as external phenomena do not appear and are not seenand when those external appearances are seen, then dharmata is notseen. However, the procedure of the Vajrayana that we have just beendiscussing is different: through that procedure we see dharmata ormind itself, and as a result the appearances of other phenomena arenot stopped. So, that is the difference between these two approaches.
Within dharmata, the alaya consciousness appears. Within this
consciousness, there are various appearances. In just that way, allphenomena are observed as mind only; they are understood as merelythe appearance of mind and we understand them to be empty. Similarly,we see that the internal mind is empty and we also understand thatboth the appearances and the mind perceiving these appearances arethe same, both lack any nature of their own.
Seeing the lack of any difference between the external appearances
and the internal mind is called “non-conceptual wisdom,” because
171
there is no way to identify anything by saying, “It’s such and such.”
There’s no identification of anything as good or as bad.
This is why we say non-conceptual wisdom does not observe signs
in any way. With non-conceptual wisdom all appearances are recognizedas being just appearances of mind. In terms of that realization, werealize the emptiness.
This is how the emptiness of any inherent existence is presented
as a principal point. However, it’s not that only emptiness has beendiscussed, presented or demonstrated; rather, it is also shown thatappearances are just mind. Because of how the Buddha taught, twodifferent traditions or systems of explaining the nature of phenomenadeveloped. The Buddha turned three wheels of dharma; the first wasknown as the Hinayana. In the second turning the Buddha emphasizedemptiness, and in the final turning of the wheel of dharma, the Buddhaemphasized that appearances are the luminous display of mind, whichitself does not exist inherently. So, the presentation of two differentways of talking about the nature of things in this text is consistentwith the different presentations that the Buddha made.
Determining that emptiness is the nature of phenomena by
reasoning is an extremely good way to go about it, but it is a long path.To go about it in this way is extremely good, for one separates from allgrasping and conceptuality. Still, if we want an introduction in termsof direct perception to this emptiness, there is no method for quicklyand directly introducing us to it. However, we can look directly at theway in which the mind abides, and that is the method presented in theMahamudra and Dzogchen traditions. In this way, appearances arerealized to be mind and mind is realized as emptiness, making arelationship in that manner. Again, there is no method for being directlyintroduced to the emptiness of the nature of phenomenal appearances.There is, however, this way to bring about a relationship that is ofgreat importance between meditative experience on the one handand the view on the other; to be introduced directly and quickly tothe emptiness that is the nature of the mind and that is something ofgreat significance.
As it is, we have never really looked at our own mind. From
beginningless time we have not looked to see what our mind really is.Mental Cultivqation
172 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
We have just gone casually along, being confused about it, thinking,
“Well, I have a mind. It does exist. It has this and that quality and it issomething that is extremely potent.” However, when we look and ask,“Where is my mind? What is my mind?” Then we don’t see much ofanything. If we look, there isn’t a whole lot to be seen.
Similarly, if we look intensively at mind, we don’t see anything.
Why is it that we don’t find anything? Is it because we don’t know howto look? Is it because we don’t know where to look? Is it because ourmind is transparent like water so we can’t see it? Or is it because ourmind is too small to see? No, when we look, we simply don’t findanything. The reason why we don’t find anything is that our minddoesn’t really exist. It is, in fact, just the nature of dharmata. This isdiscovered not through reasoning and analysis, but by just lookingright at it.
As we talked about before, we examine external phenomena by
looking for the hand, for instance, and ask, “Where is this hand? Is thethumb the hand? Are the fingers the hand?” We then think, “Yes,emptiness is probably the truth of the matter.” But, we don’t have todo that when we look at our mind. We just look for our mind, “Whereis it?” In that way, we see emptiness directly.
Does that mean that it’s just nothing whatsoever? If we don’t find
anything because mind doesn’t really exist, does that mean that we arejust a lifeless corpse? No, even though we don’t find anything when welook for our mind, nevertheless we understand and know that there iswhat is called “luminous clarity.” If we  then look for that luminous
clarity, we don’t find anything. We discover that wh ile the mind is
luminous and clear, it is also empty, and while it is empty, it isluminous and clear.
So we experience through meditation these things that can be
discovered through reasoning and analysis and arrive at the same thing.These topics that are explained in the treatises and the experience whichwe arrive at through the practice of Mahamudra meet at one point,come down to one thing.

CHAPTER  EIGHT
The Bodhisattva Levels and the Five Paths
8. T HE LEVELS  THROUGH  APPLICATION
49. The penetration of levels through application
Should be known to entail the following four steps:Through intense application involving informed
commitment,
The stage where training is done through informed
commitment
Comprises the step of definitive verification.To connect with superior, first-hand realizationIs the first of the levels, the stage the precise is encountered.
50. Through intense application employing meditation,
The impure levels followed by those which are pureAre what comprise the stage of recollection.Through application involving final perfection,The spontaneous deeds of a Buddha continually flow;Hence this is the stage of immersion into the core.

174 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
The eighth point of the transformation of dharma into dharmata is a
discussion of the bodhisattva levels (Skt. bhumi , Tib. sa) and the five
paths (Skt. marga , Tib. lam). The text presents four levels that we go
through.
/wheel The first stage encompasses the first two of the five paths and
it is called here the level of longing (Tib. möpa ). At this stage, which
covers the first path of accumulation, we haven’t realized emptinessdirectly yet, but we intellectually understand emptiness and have theaspiration to meditate on it. This leads to the second path of applicationin which we actually meditate on emptiness.
/wheel The second stage is called the stage of definitive verification
and this encompasses the third path of seeing. At this stage we actuallyarrive at direct realization of emptiness. This level is also the firstbodhisattva level.
/wheel The third stage is called the path of meditation, and at this
stage we do indeed realize emptiness directly. Even though we seeemptiness, we still have a great many predispositions or latencies towhich we have become very accustomed. Because of the strength ofthese predispositions, after we see dharmata it is covered over and webecome confused again. What can help? M editation. The Tibetan
word for meditation is gom, which is closely related to and has very
much the sense of another Tibetan word khom , which means “to
familiarize and to become accustomed to.” Up to this point, whatwe have been accustomed to is confusion, so we have to becomeaccustomed to non-confusion, so that through meditation we haveto become accustomed to dharmata. The process of getting used todharmata encompasses the fourth path of meditation. This alsocomprises the first six impure bodhisattva levels (the second toseventh). These six are called “impure levels” because they continue
to have attributes of confusion, being mistaken (still clinging to labels
or attributes) and having disturbing emotions.
Next come the three pure bodhisattva levels, at which confusion
and disturbing emotions have been for the most part abandoned andwe arrive very close to the level of a Buddha. These nine levels, rangingfrom the second to the tenth, are called “the occasion of subsequent
175
mindfulness.” Over those nine bodhisattva levels our realization and
familiarity with dharmata are increasing and, from that point of view,we are getting used to what we have already seen; it is called “the periodof subsequent mindfulness.”
Now we will speak about the fourth way that it is laid out in this
presentation.
/wheel The fourth stage is called “the stage of immersion into the
core” and is the path of final perfection, which is the state ofBuddhahood. Its nature is that we see the existence of all phenomenacompletely. Through seeing this, confusion and confused appearancesare understood to lack inherent existence. Through understanding theirlack of inherent existence, the negative emotions and ignorance areabandoned naturally. By abandoning the afflictions and ignorance,wisdom increases.
As was explained, we develop this non-conceptual wisdom further.
Also, we know clearly, without mistaking the conventional appearancesthat are undifferentiable from dharmata. We possess the wisdom thatknows the nature of phenomena and the wisdom that knows the varietyof phenomena. With these two wisdoms, one knows the way in whichthings appear to all sentient beings. Through knowing both truthsone realizes just what suffering and difficulties sentient beings haveand how they get involved in such suffering. This creates anextraordinary tender love for all sentient beings.
Such tender love leads to a capacity to help sentient beings, using
the two qualities of a Buddha’s wisdom, and the strong wish to helpothers become free from suffering is a compassionate attitude, it is acompassion with the ability to help others. One has this ability becausethe basic problem sentient beings experience is simply that of beingmistaken and having a confused view. Being in error can be correctedthrough having understood that it is suitable to cast off that difficultsituation. If one doesn’t know it, then one cannot do anything aboutit, but if one does, then it is indeed possible to extricate oneself. At agiven time one might not be able to help a particular sentient being;nevertheless, gradually, over a period of time, one will be able to helpall beings.The Bodhisattva Levels & The Five Paths
176 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
Because of the three aspects of a Buddha’s wisdom – knowledge,
compassion and capacity – the enlightened activity of a Buddha comesforth. This enlightened activity has two aspects: its continuum is nevercut and it is spontaneous. When we say that it is spontaneous, wemean that it does not require any exertion on the part of the Buddha.The way in which a Buddha enters into such activity is that the difficultsituation in which sentient beings find themselves is a situation thatcan indeed be overcome. If one does abandon it, then there is a greatadvantage to do that. If one does not, then great suffering follows. ABuddha understands the situation of sentient beings and from thatpoint of view he leads sentient beings to the path to Buddhahood. Inthis way, a Buddha engages in enlightened activity both naturally andspontaneously.
The enlightened activity of a Buddha is not only natural and
spontaneous, but it is also unceasing, that is to say, a Buddha is alwaysinvolved in helping sentient beings and the number of sentient beingsis inconceivable. The reason for the unceasing activity of a Buddha isthat all sentient beings can eventually enter into the genuine path andachieve liberation. It’s not the case that there are some sentient beingswho have the good fortune to reach enlightenment and others whowill never do so. If some sentient beings cannot achieve enlightenment,then a Buddha would help those who could and his work would bedone. However, since everyone eventually encounters the fortunatesituation in which they are able to progress along the path, a Buddha’sactivity never ends.
A Buddha has great compassion for all sentient beings without
any exception. Some people think that since a Buddha feels compassionfor sentient beings and sees their situation of suffering clearly, then aBuddha must feel pain on account of continually and very vividlyseeing the suffering of sentient beings. It’s not that way, however. Ofcourse a Buddha does see all sentient beings and their suffering vividly.At the same time, a Buddha has the capacity to eventually protect allsentient beings from suffering. This way compassion is very joyful andone thinks, “Today I was able to help this person” and the next day, “Iwas able to help two people today” and one knows that as time goes onone will be able to protect all sentient beings from suffering and help
177
them reach enlightenment. From that point of view, we feel great joy,
and therefore compassion does not have an aspect of suffering; ratherit is very joyful.
Questions
Question : Would you talk about nyams  in relationship to non-
conceptual wisdom?Rinpoche : The sorts of temporary experiences or nyams  in Tibetan are
not faults, they are good qualities in the sense that they come aboutthrough experience in meditation. However, if one becomes attachedto such experiences, then they lead to bondage and in that way theybecome faults. There are three types of temporary experiences: atemporary experience of happiness, a temporary experience of clarityand a temporary experience of non-conceptuality. As for the first,happiness, there is happiness in body and happiness in mind. As forclarity, it means feeling that one’s meditation is going extremely well,becoming very bright and clear. As for non-conceptuality, it is thesense that the stream of conceptuality has been severed or cut and thatthoughts have just stopped. The problem is that one becomes attachedto such experiences and if one becomes attached to them, then theforce of one’s meditation decreases. So from that point of view, it isimportant to abandon attachment to temporary experiences.
Question : What is the difference between illusion-like appearance for
someone who has achieved the path of seeing or the path of meditationand has illusion-like appearance at the time of what is called post-meditation? What is the difference between such illusion-likeappearance and merely thinking, without having achieved that level,merely thinking, “All of these things are just illusion?”Rinpoche : Not all that much. It is just understanding something to be
a certain way. From studying the text, we can understand that allphenomena are like illusions and that’s not terribly different from whata superior person understands. However, there is the difference ofwhether it is based upon experience or not. For someone who doesnot have such experience, nyam-nyongs  –
 i.e., to say that all phenomenaThe Bodhisattva Levels & The Five Paths
178 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
are like illusions –  is merely from the point of view of knowledge or
prajna, from the point of view of intelligence, a sharp knowledge ofthings. We could say, “All phenomena are emptiness” or “All phenomenaare like illusions,” but without such experience, it’s just knowledge.However, when someone has realized emptiness in direct perception,has seen emptiness directly during meditation, then later in post-meditation, when various appearances arise again, that person takesthem to be just like illusions and does so from the point of view ofhaving actual experience. Now later, when one arrives at what are called“the pure grounds” (the eighth, ninth and tenth bodhisattva grounds),one experiences emptiness and dependent arising in union. However,one does not experience such a union of emptiness and dependentarising at these early stages, such as the path of seeing. At that time, atthe path of seeing, what one has is a definite knowledge or certaintythat arises from experience.
Question : Does one have a certainty or definite knowledge with regard
to illusion-like appearances at the time of the subsequent achievementof the path of seeing –
 such a certainty that arises from experience?
Rinpoche : Yes, because the path of seeing is experience.
Question : In other texts they talk about achieving such levels as Guru
Rinpoche, who could actually put his hand through pillars and so on.It’s more than anything intellectual. The world is an illusion, I guess,if you can put your hand through rocks.Rinpoche : Guru Rinpoche’s putting his hand through a rock or pillar
is a sign of appearance and mind having become mixed. For instance,at Gampopa’s monastery there’s a pillar that has a gap in it. This cameabout when a student asked Gampopa, “What does it mean when onesays the mixing of mind and appearance?” And Gampopa said, “It’slike this!” [Gampopa put his hand through a pillar splitting it intotwo sections creating a gap between the top and bottom section.] Eversince that time there has been a gap in that pillar. This is what happensas one proceeds beyond the path of seeing, and mind and appearancebecome actually mixed.
179
Question : Would you say something about the difference between non-
established, not truly existent and non-existence?Rinpoche : First of all, as for the word “non-existent,” it is medpa  in
Tibetan. It can have two different meanings. Sometimes “non-existent”refers to emptiness; i.e., the final nature of all phenomena. Sometimesit just means that something isn’t there. For instance, if you say, “Idon’t have any money,” then that non-existence of money for oneselfis not a case of the final nature of things. The term “not truly established”(denpa matrub ) mainly refers to emptiness in that one is pointing to
the falsity of other things, that other phenomena exist through theforce of or in the manner of not being true; they are false. In this wayone is pointing to emptiness. As for the term “not established” ( matrub ),
it is pretty much the same as the term “not truly established.”Tsongkapa, the founder of the Gelugpa tradition, said many times inhis writings that one must add on this qualification “truly” when onespeaks about the way in which things exist; one has to say “not trulyexisting or established” rather than just “not established.” He saidthis many times, that this particular qualification was necessary. Manyother scholars have said that it’s okay not to affix that qualification“truly” and there has been a lot of debate about whether one has tosay “not truly established” or whether it is okay just to say “notestablished.” It’s not all that important because they pretty muchmean the same thing.The Bodhisattva Levels & The Five Paths

CHAPTER  NINE
The Benefits of the Transformation
Of Dharma into Dharmata
9. D ISADVANTAGES  OF NO TRANSFORMATION
51. The introduction to disadvantagesIncludes the four which would follow as a resultOf there being no transformation; namely, the flawThat preventing afflictions’ entry would lack a support;The flaw of the path’s introduction lacking support;The flaw of there being no basis of imputationFor speaking of individuals reaching nirvana;As well as the flaw of no basis of imputationFor distinctions between three forms of enlightenment.
The ninth point of the transf ormation of dharma into dharmata is
the disadvantages of there not being any transformation. This refersto the fact that various unfavorable situations do not come aboutafter one has transformed one’s state, place or condition. There arefour points here.

182 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
/wheel The first point is that disturbing emotions do not return after
they have been abandoned. If disturbing emotions were to return, asthey are very harmful, this would be a fault or disadvantage. However,for the bodhisattvas who have realized dharmata and developed non-conceptual wisdom, the disturbing emotions do not return. They don’treturn because the disturbing emotions are themselves a state of falsenessand confusion. Once that has been understood, then they just fallaway and don’t come back.
/wheel The second unfavorable situation that does not come about is
the exhaustion or wearing out of the effectiveness of the antidotes tothe disturbing emotions. However, there is no extinguishing of thepotency of the path. The reason is that the disturbing emotions arethemselves mistaken and the wisdom, having become manifest, isgenuine, not confused. Since it is true, it is never used up or finished.
/wheel The third point is that there is no returning to former states.
This non-returning to one’s former state and having fears and doubts,thinking that one might fall back, was discussed by the great Indianmaster Dharmakirti. He illustrated it in terms of two examples. If westart with a pot of water, heat it and bring it to boil, eventually thewater becomes cold again. Similarly, if we apply fire to gold, it melts.But once we take the heat away, the gold returns to a solid state. Wemight think that no matter how much we purify our condition,eventually we would just fall back into the condition we had been inbefore. But the situation is not like that of heated water and goldbecause the nature of gold is a solid and the nature of water is cold anda liquid. So these two substances simply return to their original nature;however, that’s not the same with the disturbing emotions, confusionand samsara. The disturbing emotions, confusion, and samsara areadventitious stains and mistaken views which are not part of the originalnature of dharmata. Therefore, once one understands the mistake andrealizes the true nature, the dharmata, one does not fall back into theprevious condition.
/wheel The fourth point is the unfavorable condition of regression
from knowing everything, a Buddha’s omniscience. We might think,“Well, it’s not possible to know everything.” And we might comparethat with someone who is training in jumping, who can indeed learn
183
to jump further and further. However, eventually, the jumper will reach
the limit of how far he can jump. We might think, “Well, it’s like that.I can develop a great deal of knowledge and good qualities and soforth, but I cannot learn everything.”
However, the situation is actually of a different nature and indeed
such omniscience does exist. There are two reasons why omnisciencedoes arise. The first reason is that “jumping” is something that is donewith the body and the body is composed of particles; for that reasonthere is a limit to what it can do. Mind is of a different nature; it is ofthe nature of luminous clarity and there is no limit to its ability toknow. When one realizes the dharmata, then one naturally knows allconventional phenomena that appear within dharmata.
The second reason it is possible to achieve omniscience is that it is
appropriate that we would pass beyond the confusion and hardship ofcyclic existence; we can achieve release of nirvana. In Tibetan nirvanais “that which is passed beyond suffering.” Since it is appropriate topass beyond samsara and to achieve nirvana, omniscience is possible.
10. T HE BENEFITS  OF TRANSFORMATION
52. The introduction to the benefitsShould be known to include these four, but in the reverse.
The tenth and last topic of the transformation of dharma into
dharmata is the advantages of having transformed one’s state intothat of wisdom. This relates to the previous ninth topic about thefour points: the disadvantages in regard to the possibility ofabandoning disturbing emotions without them returning, achievingan antidote that does not become exhausted, and the two aspects ofthe possibility of achieving omniscience. There’s another side to it,namely, that we can indeed abandon the disturbing emotions. Theantidote is not of the nature that suffers from exhaustion, and wecan achieve nirvana and become a Buddha.The Benefits of Transformation
184 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
To summarize, the benefits of this transformation are:
/wheel The absence of the disturbing emotions,
/wheel the presence of the antidotes,
/wheel the absence of returning to former states,
/wheel the absence of not knowing everything.

CHAPTER  TEN
The Conclusion
V. T HE CONCLUSION
A. T HE COMPATIBILITY  OF DHARMA  AND DHARMATA
53. To show how phenomena not existing appear,
They are likened to dream and compared to illusion and so
on;
To illustrate the total transformation,To space it is likened, to gold and water and so on.
We have arrived at the conclusion of the discussion of dharma and
dharmata. The way in which these two are compatible with oneanother is set forth in this last chapter. This is explained in terms ofthree examples.
/wheel The first example explains how phenomena (dharma) do not
ultimately exist, and that such appearances, although empty, still appearto us. This is described in the example of a dream, an illusion or amirage. Dreams, illusions and mirages don’t actually exist and yet they

186 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
appear just because they do not exist, while not existing; right at that
time, indeed, they appear. Similarly, the phenomena of cyclic existencedo not exist; nevertheless, within not existing, they appear.
/wheel The second example illustrates the transformation of one’s
ordinary knowledge into a state of non-conceptual wisdom. Whatexample is suitable to show the ultimate? Indeed, in the beginningthere are faults, defects, but one can separate from those, one can partways. A comparison would be like clouds in the sky. Sometimes thereare clouds in the sky, but that is not the nature of the sky. It is quitesuitable for these clouds to just pass away and for the sky and clouds topart ways because the nature of the sky is to be really free of clouds.Similarly, gold might become tarnished, but tarnish is not the natureof gold; it is suitable for gold to be restored to its pure state.
/wheel The third example illustrates how one can have the nature of
dharmata, yet it not be apparent as an ordinary being. Water can becomequite dirty, but the dirt is not the nature of water, because dirt andwater have different natures and water can be restored to its purity.
Because the two have different natures, the purity of the water can
be restored such as by letting the water just sit.
So, like those three examples, temporarily dharmata is concealed,
blocked by phenomena of samsara, but that is not the nature of thesituation and dharmata does not need to remain covered over by thephenomena of samsara; rather, it is appropriate for the situation tobecome pure.
This is the end of the ten topics.
B. T HE AUTHOR  OF THE TEXT
54. The verses distinguishing phenomena and pure beingcomposed by the guardian Maitreya are herewith concluded.
55. The Kashmiri Khenpo Mahadzana and the Tibetan
translator Lotsawa Gelong Senge Gyaltsen collaborated in
187
translating this [from Sanskrit into Tibetan] and in
correcting their work, thus providing this finalized version.
Generally speaking, at the great monastic universities of Nalanda and
Vikramashila in India, from which the teachings of the Buddha-dharmacame and were spread widely, various sorts of treatises were composed.Among the different people who studied at these monastic universities,there were some who were able to compose treatises and some whowere not. Some were the best, some were fair and some were poor.What are the characteristics of those three groups? The best ones tocompose treatises are those who see dharmata directly, those who haveprofound realization. The middle group are those who practiced theManjushri practice and were able to meet with Manjushri. The lowestgroup are those who are skilled in five topics of knowledge and couldcompose treatises, but they are the lowest of the three.
This particular treatise that we have been studying is particularly
distinguished because it was composed by someone who saw dharmatadirectly and dwells on the tenth bodhisattva level. This makes thistreatise of the highest kind.
So, I wanted to explain to you why I chose this particular treatise
to teach. What is explained in this text is the way in which one arrivesat an inferential realization of just what dharmata (the nature of allphenomena) is. At the same time, there is a very powerful relationshipbetween what is taught here and the practice of meditation of students– namely, dharmata. This dharmata discussed in this text is the sameas the mind’s way of abiding, the mind’s nature, and therefore it isrelated to the practice of meditation, in that what we meditate upon isjust this mind’s nature. Through such meditation, we arrive at thefinal result and for that reason meditation is extremely important. That’swhy I have chosen this text.
In earlier times it was said by various accomplished persons that
to realize these great commentaries we must receive the oral instructions.That’s the important point: what one has learned and what has beentaught in this book can indeed direct one’s practice. So, please practicein that way.The Conclusion

NOTES
1. The two Ornaments are: The Ornament of Clear Realization
(Abhisamayalankara ), a text on the Prajnaparamita, and The Ornament of the
Mahayana Sutras  (Mahayanasutralankara ). The two distinctions are:
Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes  (Madhyantavibhaga ), a text on
the Middle-way school, and (this text), Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata
(Dharmadharmatavibhaga ), a text discussing the Buddha-essence. The
Uttaratantra is The Changeless Nature,  a treatise on Buddha-Essence.
2. The Buddha’s teachings occurred in three important phases, known as the
three dharmachakras  or three turnings of the wheel of dharma. The first turning
includes the teachings common to all traditions, those of the Four NobleTruths, the Eight-fold Path, selflessness and impermanence, which can leadto liberation from suffering. The second turning expanded on the first, thefruition of its teachings on the emptiness of all phenomena (the Prajnaparamitateachings) and universal compassion is Buddhahood. The teachings of thethird turning are those on the Buddha potential and its inherent qualities. Fora detailed account of the three wheels of dharma see Thrangu Rinpoche’s The
Three Vehicles of Buddhist Practice  published by Namo Buddha Publications.
3. See chapter one of Gampopa’s The Jewel Ornament of Liberation  for the five
families or types of potential for enlightenment.
4. The three natures or three aspects of experience are: the imaginary nature
(Skt. parikalita, Tib. kun rtag ), the dependent nature (Skt.  paratantra, Tib.
gzhan dbang ) and the truly existent nature (Skt.  parinispanna, Tib. yongs grub ).
These are explained differently in the Cittamatra and Shentong schools.
5. The five prevailing themes are: name, ground, concept, original wisdom
and suchness.
194 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
6. “The Mother” is a collective term applied to the teachings contained in the
Prajnaparamita.
There are seventeen principal works on the Prajnaparamita called “the
six mothers and eleven sons or daughters.” The distinction between worksbeing defined as mothers or daughters is whether they have all eight aspects ortopics of the Prajnaparamita or not. The eight topics are clearly distinguishedby Maitreya in The Ornament of Clear Realization .
7. According to the Cittamatra or Mind-only system, all phenomena pertain
either to the inner perceiving aspect of consciousness or to the outer perceivedaspect of consciousness; in other words they are all mind. The division of eachmoment of awareness into an inner perceiving mind and an outer perceivedobject is a conceptual invention. So the whole of existence is empty of a dualityof substance between mind and matter. Consciousness that is self-aware, emptyof the duality of perceiver and perceived, is genuine, is actually there accordingto the Cittamatra school. – Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche
8. The Yogacarya-Madhyamaka here corresponds to the Shentong school.9. The headings in italics have been added to help the reader while the headings
in small caps correspond to the verses and outline of the text.
10. In our present day, for example, T rungpa Rinpoche received a shambhala
text from Padmasambhava who lived over a 1,000 years ago and DudjomRinpoche also received many ancient transmissions from Padmasambhava.The receiving of this knowledge is known as terma in Tibetan and a personwho has the exceptional qualities and training to receive such a text is a terton.
11. Thrangu Rinpoche has always emphasized that all three traditions of
Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana were practiced in Tibet and that theHinayana which literally means “lesser vehicle” is in no way inferior to theMahayana.
“Also we should not think of Theravada as necessarily Hinayana. We
have to understand Hinayana in context, it basically refers to a person, anindividual who wants to seek enlightenment for him or herself alone. Justbecause one is a Theravadan does not mean they want to do that. TheTheravadan individual may want to do it for others. In Theravada teachingsthey practice the four Bramahaviharas, the four infinities of love, compassion,joy and equanimity. So it is not true to say that Theravada teachings do notemphasize compassion, love and compassion, they do.” – Traleg Rinpoche
195
12. The Vajrayana teachings are often called this and Thrangu Rinpoche has
said that they are basically the same. He has said that the word often translatedas “secret” should be translated as “essential” so it would be the essential mantraVajrayana.
13. Buddhists make a distinction between how the world appears to us and
how it truly is. One modern example is that we may see a table and experienceit as solid, as brown, and made of wood. That is how it appears (we couldsay the dharma of the table). However, a physicist will tell us that the tableactually is a collection of millions of carbon atoms which are moving attremendous speeds and there are tremendous distances between these atomsso the “table” is actually over 99.99% space. The color we see is just radiationgiven off at a certain wavelength. This is closer to what the table actually is(we could say the dharmata of the table). Experienced meditators (such asMilarepa) could demonstrate the emptiness of the table by simply puttingtheir hand through it.
So conventionally or on the relative level, when we hit our hand against
a wall, it will get badly bruised and hurt. However, on the ultimate level, theessence of the hand and the essence of the wall are empty.
14. Dharma has many meaning;, however it mainly refers to two things:
“Dharma” as the Buddha’s teachings and “dharma” meaning phenomena ormental objects.
15. As mentioned with the example of the table and atoms, Buddhist make a
distinction between how the world appears to us and how it truly is. So dharmais phenomena as we perceive it on the relative or conventional level anddharmata is phenomena as it truly isi.e. empty.
16. Of the three general classifications of suffering, two relate to impermanence.
First, the suffering of change or impermanence is that all joyful experiencesinevitably expire and turn into the suffering of change or loss. Second, andmore subtle, is the constant threat of change running through conditionedlife. This is what is described as the innate suffering of the process of existence.
17. Ultimate happiness itself is free of such notions as eliminating or attaining
something. Enlightened mind is beyond the desire to get rid of suffering andto attain happiness. We need to understand that ultimate happiness is in itselfliberation from such divided thoughts. Ultimate happiness is an experienceNotes

beyond any conditions. Nirvana can’t be divided. When the experience of
nirvana becomes alive though, it does so according to three classifications.The first is nirvana known as gog-pai-mydn-das-pa , “nirvana of cessation.”
The second nirvana is called ma-gnds-pai-mydn-das-pa , “non-abiding nirvana,”
which is beyond any level or stage that can be distinguished. The third nirvanais known as rang-shin-kyi-mydn- das-pa , “unconditioned” or “natural nirvana.”
– Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche
See the August 2004 issue of Thar Lam  by Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal for a
detailed teaching on the different nirvanas by T raleg Kyabgon Rinpoche.
18. What is important to understand here is that it is not the objects of our
experiences themselves which are abandoned, transformed or changed. Infact, both from the sutra and tantra approach, there is nothing wrong withthe objects of our experiences – they are neither pure nor impure, but are onlywhat they are. The impurity in our experiences does not come from the objectsof our experiences but from the way in which we perceive them; because ofthe presence of clinging to a self and to duality, we perceive the world in acertain way – we perceive the objects of experience to be independent, to bepermanent, to be substantial. So, when we talk about impure appearances, weare really referring to the lack of accuracy in our perception of the world. It isthis lack of clarity, this lack of accuracy, which we seek to eliminate. – Jamgon
Kongtrul Rinpoche
19. Theis can be explained by way of the Mind-only school which posits the
existence of eight consciousnesses; eye sense-consciousness, ear senseconsciousness, nose sense-consciousness, tongue sense-consciousness, bodysense-consciousness, mental consciousness, afflicted or ego-consciousness andthe all-basis or alaya consciousness. So what happens is that all of the habitualtendencies or habits or ways of perceiving are stored in the alaya consciousness,the alaya vijnana;  then when certain conditions come together, we get the
projections of all of these appearances that are the result of our having storedour previous habits in this alaya consciousness. We think that these projectionsfrom our own consciousness are real, when in fact they’re not, they’re justconfused appearances. The alaya consciousness is called by two different namesto illustrate the two functions that it performs. The first name is the holdingconsciousness because it holds all of the habitual tendencies, the imprintsfrom our previous ways of perceiving. The second name is the conditionedconsciousness because when certain conditions come together, then certainhabits wake up and emit certain projections of appearances. In this way, you
197
can think of the alaya consciousness as being like a tape recorder. When it’s on
record, then it’s storing all of the information, all of the sounds etc., thenwhen you put it on play, it sends them out. So sometimes that example is usedand you can evaluate it and see if you think it’s a good example or not. Interms of the way that confusion arises, it is explained that the afflictedconsciousness is like wind and the alaya consciousness is like the ocean. So thewind of the afflicted consciousness blows on this ocean of the alayaconsciousness and causes these waves to come up out of it and those waves arethe dualistic appearances that we think to be real. – Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso
Rinpoche
20. The Vaibhashika and Sautrantika schools are Hinayana and the Mind-
only and Madhyamaka schools are Mahayana. The Madhyamaka or Middle-way school is divided into two major schools by the Tibetans: the Rangtongschool which follows the teachings of Nagarjuna fairly closely and maintainsthat everything is completely empty and the Shentong school which maintainsthat this emptiness is indivisible from luminosity/clarity (Tib. salwa ) and that
all sentient beings possess Buddha-essence.
21. The continuum of consciousness can be broken down into its individual
moments of the past, present and the future. For example, a thought can bebroken into the part of it that is the past, the part of it that is the present andthe part that has not yet arisen.
22. The Lankavatara sutra says:
External reality appears as such to human beingsFrom whose minds originate diverse dualitiesDue to an interaction between their discriminating thoughts and
psychic imprints.
External reality is the product of the mind:All appearances are, therefore, completely unreal,For they are all the manifestation of the mind.
23.  This reasoning is presented in several of Rinpoche’s books and goes
somewhat like this. If we take a hand, we see that it is not a solid hand, but ismade up of fingers, flesh, bones, etc. The only reason we say it is “a hand” isour mind imputes that it is a hand. If we take a finger, it also is a categorizationand label because the finger is really made up of a fingernail, skin, joints, etc.When we keep breaking this down smaller and smaller, there is always a smallerNotes
198 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
particle. Say we reach the smallest indivisible particle, often called an atom,
that atom can be broken down because it has a north side, an east side, a westside, etc. In other words, it can always be broken down into smaller units.
24. Carrying this argument on, we may say, for example, “Well, I can go
outside and touch the stupa, paint it and so on and everyone else will see thesame appearance that I see.” The answer to this is that yes we do see the samething but it is more like a hundred people standing on the shore in a darknight looking at the moon reflected in the water. Now every single person seesthe moon reflected in the water, but clearly the moon is not actually in thewater. Everyone sees this illusion in the water because of the dependentconditions (Tib. tendrel ): the person having eyes, the night being dark, the
water being still, and the moon being present.
25. In terms of the Mahayana philosophical schools, everybody agrees on the
conduct in terms of how it is described; you cultivate loving-kindness andcompassion and you act for the benefit of others. So there is no disagreementthere. But in terms of the philosophical view, then there is disagreement andso it breaks down into the Mind-only school and the Middle way school. –Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche
26. Lacking inherent nature, by nature we mean in an example: take water, it
appears as solid (ice) sometimes, it appears as fluid (water) and as a hot gas(steam) other times. These are the three appearances of the water molecule.But its inherent or true nature is more like one atom of oxygen connected toatoms of hydrogen. Similarly, the greatest Madhyamaka scholar will say thathouses, people, trees and internal feelings such as anger and happiness doappear, so they are obviously not non-existent. But when examined closelytheir true nature is empty in that they are not solid and real but projections ofmind. T wo people can go to a movie and one will see a beautiful, upliftingmovie, while the other will see a terrible piece of trash. The actual movie or itstrue nature is neither, but simply a series of thousands of single frames oncelluloid film, which the mind creates into a movie.
27. We choose to translate klesha  as “disturbing emotions” rather than
“afflictions” because although the Sanskrit word has the meaning of somepermanent stain like an affliction, the Tibetan word nyon mong  has more the
meaning of something that disturbs the peace of the mind, these being mainlyattachment or desire, anger or aggression, bewilderment or ignorance, jealousy,and pride.
199
28. They motivate us to act in various ways, which is what karma, the truth
that every action brings about an effect, really means. The effect of all actionsestablishes certain propensities or tendencies within us. This process is whatkarma in truth means. And the result is suffering.
29. What happens is that upon the basis of the belief in the existence of an
inherently existent self there is the imputation of everything other than thatself as inherently other. Consequently, attachment arises towards the self andthat which is identified with the self and aversion towards that which is otherthan the self or that which threatens the self. This leads to hope and anxiety.Attachment and aversion together with the ignorance that accompanies theseare the three root mental afflictions or disturbing emotions. From these arisejealousy, pride and so forth, all the various and innumerable other mentalafflictions. On the basis of these mental afflictions, the actions performed areafflicted and as a result the imprints of afflicted actions are left in the mind orwhat is called “the alaya consciousness.” The habit or imprint left by actionsproduces uninterrupted experiences of samsara, like the cups in the wheels ofa watermill. This is what is meant by the term “karma”; karma is the maturationof experiences on the basis of the imprints of former actions. Since the root ofall of these steps is the false imputation of an inherently existing self, it is theerroneous imputation that must be eradicated or cut through. – Jamgon
Kongtrul Rinpoche
30. When hearing of the need to eliminate the belief in a self, many people
think this refers to a belief in something that actually exists, like attachmentto something really there. In fact, it’s not. It is the habit of misconceiving thatwhich is not a self to be a self. It is the habit of believing in something that isin fact not there. Ultimately, from that point of view, there is nothing really toabandon in the sense of a thing that can be thrown away. In the realization ofegolessness or selflessness, there is nothing that actually has to be thrownaway, rather it is the recognition of what has always been the case. Althoughpeople accept the view of the non-existence of a self, it is not the same ashaving actually realized selflessness.  Selflessness can only be realized throughpractice. And realization consists of the eradication of the habit, not just thebelief, of viewing things as a self. – Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche
31. The first recognition of the nature of mind, which is brought about in the
student’s experience through the intervention of the lama – whether during ateaching, a ritual ceremony, or guided meditation – becomes the basis for theNotes

student’s subsequent practice of dharma, the purpose of which is to enable the
student to become accustomed and habituated to experiencing the world inthe manner first pointed out. When, through the practice of the path, thestudent’s experience reaches the ineffable fruition of Buddhahood, he or she issaid to have fully realized the nature of mind. – Lama T ashi Namgyal
32. The person being born while in the bardo must choose this particular egg
and sperm coming together for it to develop into a human.
33. Whatever we perceive is devoid of inherent existence. We perceive according
to our mental outlook, which depends upon our habits or karmic patterns;our perception is dependent upon the habitual mind that sees, hears, tastes,etc. “Common” doesn’t mean we all did the same thing; we do similar things.Beings in different psychological states of existence experience things differently.Beings in the same realm perceive with a similar outlook but individualexperience varies. So the same happiness and pain aren’t shared by all identically,only mutually. We experience similarly due to mutual conceptual patternsand create further individual patterns. – Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche
34. These are all cases that are called “common” from the perspective of there
being a specific common result produced through the combination of theprimary cause deriving from the phenomena of one mindstream and theintermediate condition deriving from those of another. – Jim Scott, translatedfrom Mipham Rinpoche’s commentary Maitreya’s Distinguishing Phenomena
and Pure Being .
35. The reasoning goes as such: the sensory consciousnesses receive sensory
information or what are called sensory objects ( which also arise from the alaya,
see note 19 )  – say a white cup. How do we know it is a cup? We have to
connect this visual object with some previous experience with the object so weknow it holds tea, is fragile, is white, made of china, etc. This connectionrequires memory or a storehouse of information and that is what is stored inthe alaya consciousness.
36. Along with the eight consciousnesses there is something else that is often
mentioned. This is called the “immediate mind.”  The immediate mind is nota separate consciousness. It is the function of the impure mind that links theoperations of one consciousness to another. It is that impulse or force of habitthat causes the six consciousnesses to arise from the ground of the all basis and
201
the afflicted consciousness. It is that which causes the mental consciousness to
arise on the basis of a sense perception and so on. It is an identifiable function ofthe impure mind, but is not in itself a separate consciousness therefore there areonly eight types of impure consciousness. It is not considered to be a ninth.
In regard to the immediate mind, many texts present it as that which is
generated by the cessation of a previous instant of consciousness and whichlinks one type of consciousness to another. In the particular presentation bythe third Gyalwa Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje’s, “Profound Inner Meaning,”the immediate mind is presented as that which causes the lack of recognitionof dharmata or lack of recognition of the nature of things, in which case itwould be considered an aspect of the seventh consciousness. The seventhconsciousness in that way has an inward-directed aspect to it, which is theaspect of the seventh consciousness that causes the other consciousnesses toarise and function; that is the immediate mind. – Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche
37. This refers to clairvoyance where certain individuals can perceive what is
happening in another individual’s consciousnesses.
38. There are two distinct aspects involved in awareness of another’s mind:
the objective one in which the observer focusing attention on the mind ofanother produces an image of it; and the subjective one consisting of theexperience accompanying consciousness of another’s mind, an experience whichis the specific content of the observer’s mind alone. These two processes arecomparable to the yogi’s consciousness of the happiness or suffering of anordinary person’s mind through focusing on that, without his experience inthat connection being the same as that of the other person. – Jim Scott,translated from Mipham Rinpoche’s commentary Maitreya’s Distinguishing
Phenomena and Pure Being .
39.  In India while the Madhyamaka school was prominent in Northern India,
the Indians did not make a formal distinction between the Rangtong orShentong view. However, centuries later the Tibetans did make a distinction.The Rangtong position was supported by great scholars such as Tsonkhapawho went on to found the Gelug school. They maintained that everythingwas empty and to suggest that there was a permanent quality such as Buddha-essence negates the teachings on the emptiness of all phenomena. Then therewere equally great scholars such as the third Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje,who maintained that there was an inherent, permanent, stainless quality called“Buddha-essence” in all sentient beings.Notes
202 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
40. Dharmadhatu is essentially the same as dharmakaya; they are two indivisible
aspects of the same thing. The dharmakaya emphasizes the wisdom aspectwhile dharmadhatu emphasizes the emptiness aspect.
41. Khenpo Tsultrim explains this passage as follows. The texts related to the
Shentong view distinguish between two types of suchness or nirvana: naturallypure nirvana and nirvana which has been purified of superficial stains. Theformer refers to the ultimate nature, i.e., the Buddha-essence, which is presentfrom the very beginning and during all three phases of development, namely,during the base, path and fruition stages (or ordinary being, bodhisattva andBuddha stages), and whose essence is free of any stain or imperfectionwhatsoever. The latter refers to nirvana, seen from the perspective of its beingthe fruition of the path.
It is evident that this distinction is a matter of pure convention, since the
nirvana achieved through the path is none other that the actualization of“that untouched by stain:” i.e., that nature which has been present from thevery outset. Thus, the essence of transformation consists, not in a change inthe basic nature, but in a definitive elimination of everything that is “other”than, or not inherent to, that nature. – Jim Scott, translated from MiphamRinpoche’s commentary Maitreya’s Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being .
42. One can think of it this way: the dharmakaya is the way things really are,
and since the Buddha achieved complete understanding of this state, thedharmakaya is the body of the Buddha. Only the minds of very pure beingssuch as other Buddhas can perceive the dharmakaya, so there is thesambhogakaya with pure realms such as T ushita where pure bodhisattvas canvisit and receive teachings. In fact, this is where Asanga went after twelveyears of meditating to receive this text from the Maitreya Buddha. Finally,there is the nirmanakaya which is our ordinary reality and the Buddhamanifested as an ordinary human being as the Shakyamuni Buddha. This lastrealm can be experienced by impure beings such as ourselves.
43. In the context where the transformation has not been undergone, anything
possessing form and any sound characterized as speech qualify as appearancesshared in common, whereas mind is not experienced in common. When thetransformation has been undergone, however, all phenomena are nothingother than manifestations of the suchness and there is no impurity involved.For that reason, they are appearances demonstrating the specific feature ofbeing exclusively pure self-manifestation (meaning non-dualistic experienceas opposed to dualistic perception).
203
Nevertheless, in the eyes of those who have not undergone transformation,
the one who has achieved that transformation will be experienced in a fashioninvolving differentiation, where he is seen as being a teacher distinct from histeaching and so on. – Jim Scott, translated from Mipham Rinpoche’scommentary Maitreya’s Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being .
44. As the word is used here and translated as observation, it refers to the
absence of the actual process of a sensory consciousness perceiving its object.Normally, sensory consciousness is taught as being non-conceptual, but inthis context its activity is conceptual in the sense that it involves the dualityinherent in the subtle act of measurement constituting the process ofperception. In other words, to perceive an object, the sensory consciousnessmust distinguish that object from everything that is not that object, and thisis a subtly conceptual operation. – Jim Scott, from Mipham Rinpoche’scommentary Maitreya’s Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being .
45. For example, in The Mosaic of the Rare and Supreme Ones, Requested by
Kashyapa , the Buddha said:
Kashyapa, “permanence” is one extreme, “impermanence” another. The middle
between these two extremes is where there is no analysis, no description, nosupport, no appearance, no principles of awareness, and no place. Kashyapa,this is the middle path and is called “intimate and detailed discernment ofphenomena correctly applied.” – Jim Scott, translated from MiphamRinpoche’s commentary Maitreya’s Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being .
46. The point here is that there is no experience of the center of space, because,
as the Buddha taught, space has no outer boundaries and therefore, no center.
47. The ultimate achievement of union, in which there is no differentiation
between a meditative and post-meditative state, occurs at the level ofBuddhahood. An approximation of this occurs on the levels achieved by noblebeings, and there is a partial resemblance to it in a mindstream where thesymbolic wisdom of the mantric path has manifested due to profound skilfulmeans. – Jim Scott, translated from Mipham Rinpoche’s commentaryMaitreya’s Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being .
48. This verse explains an important point, that there is no contradiction
between the ultimate way in which a Buddha sees – via the two aspects ofNotes
204 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
original wisdom, (1) simplicity and (2) complexity or variety, – and the
meditative equipoise of the path of meditation, whether this is accompaniedby the process of appearances or not. – Jim Scott, translated from MiphamRinpoche’s commentary Maitreya’s Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being .
49. This refers to a bodhisattva who has developed non-conceptual wisdom:
the result of endeavors undertaken by a practitioner in following the path andbeing victorious over afflicting factors.
50. It may be helpful here to understand the term for “consciousness,” which
in Sanskrit is “ vijnana ,” which is a specific type of cognition. It is the term for
“cognition,” “ jnana ,” with the prefix “ vi,” which means complete or fully
developed. This is a more specific term than cognition and, although it maysound like a positive thing to say “fully-developed cognition,” in this contextit is actually somewhat pejorative because it refers to cognition that has becomedeveloped in the sense of becoming coarsened. This is the type of cognition,or consciousness, that we as ordinary individuals have and is what is dividedinto the eight or six types of consciousnesses. All of these consciousnesses areconsidered manifestations of the mind’s impurity. They are things that arisewhen a mind does not recognize its own nature. The basic idea of thedevelopment of consciousness is that when a mind does not recognize its ownnature – its inherent lucidity – which is just a mere cognition, it runs wild.And running wild it becomes coarse or develops into deluded cognition orconsciousness, which is characteristic of samsara. Nevertheless, in the midstof all this confusion, the nature of these consciousnesses, the nature of thisdeluded mind, is unchanged. This unchanging nature of the mind is called“the pure alaya” as opposed to the “alaya consciousness,” one of the eightconsciousnesses. That pure alaya is mere cognition, fundamental jnana itself.Also, if you wish to make a distinction between the mind in its impuremanifestations and the nature of the mind, mind itself, then mind (impure)will be called “ sem,” and the mind itself, that mere cognition itself, will be
called “ sem nyi, ” mind in itself.

Egolessness or selflessness of person.  (Skt. pudgalanairatmya ) This doctrine asserts
that when one examines or looks for the person, one finds that it is emptyand without self. The person does not possess a self (Skt. atman , Tib.
bdag-nyid ) as an independent or substantial self.  This position is held by
most Buddhist schools.
Egolessness or selflessness of phenomena.  (Skt. dharma-nairatmya ) This doctrine
asserts that not only is there selflessness of the person, but when oneexamines outer phenomena, one finds that external phenomena are alsoempty: i.e., they do not have an independent or substantial nature. Thisposition is not held by the Hinayana schools, but is put forth by theMahayana schools, particularly the Cittamatra school.
Eight consciousnesses . The alaya consciousness (eighth), afflicted consciousness
(seventh), mental consciousness (sixth), and the five sense-consciousnesses.The Hinayana sutras generally discuss mind in terms of sixconsciousnesses, namely, the five sensory consciousnesses and the sixthmental consciousness. The Mahayana Cittamatra (Mind-only) schooltalks about the eight consciousness in which the first six are the same butthe seventh and eighth consciousnesses are added. In the Hinayanatradition the functions of the seventh and eighth consciousnesses aresubsumed in the sixth, mental consciousness.
Eight mental constructs  or complexities are mental formulations that phenomena
have such attributes as arising and ceasing, being singular or plural, comingand going, and being the same or being different.

they are attachment to gain, attachment to pleasure, attachment to praise,attachment to fame, aversion to loss, aversion to pain, aversion to blameand aversion to a bad reputation.
Emptiness.  (Skt. shunyata , Tib. tong pa nyi ) Sometimes also translated as
voidness. The Buddha taught in the second turning of the wheel of dharmathat external phenomena and the internal phenomena or concept of selfor “I” have no real existence and therefore are “empty.”
Enlightenment . (Tib. jang chub ) The definition varies according to the Buddhist
tradition; usually the same as Buddhahood. The Hinayana traditiondefines liberation as the freedom from birth in samsara, with mind freeof ignorance and emotional conflict. The Mahayana tradition holds thatenlightenment is not complete without development of compassion andGlossary of T erms
210 Distinguishing Dharma & Dharmata
commitment to use skilful means to liberate all sentient beings. In the
Vajrayana teachings, the foregoing stages of enlightenment are necessary,but ultimate enlightenment is a thorough purification of ego and concepts.The final fruition of complete liberation transcends all duality andconceptualization.
Eternalism . (Tib. rtag lta ) The belief that there is a permanent and causeless
creator of everything; in particular, that one’s identity or consciousnesshas a concrete essence which is independent, everlasting and singular.

experience, concept or set of philosophical ideas.
Form realm . God realms of subtle form.

Habitual patterns.  (Skt. vasana . Tib. bakchak ) Patterns of conditional response
that exist as traces or tendencies stored in the alaya-consciousness, theeighth consciousness sometimes called the store-house or all-baseconsciousness. So called because it is a repository of all karmicallyconditioned patterns. All dualistic or ego-oriented experiences leave aresidue, which is stored in the alaya-consciousness until a later time whensome conscious occurrence activates the habitual pattern. The patternthen generates a response in the form of a perception or an action. Thisresponse leaves its own karmic residue, stored again in the unconsciousrepository, and the cycle continues. The explanation of this system is acentral teaching of the Cittamatrin tradition of Mahayana Buddhism.
Hearing lineage.  (Tib. nyan gyu ) A lineage of instruction passed orally from
teacher to disciple. Teachings of a hearing lineage are usually very secret,since they can only be received by direct, personal communication withthe guru. “Hearing lineage” is also a common epithet for the Kagyulineage.

Idiot compassion . This is the desire to help others but it is not accompanied by
sufficient wisdom, so that what one does may not really be beneficial. Anexample is teaching someone who is hungry to fish, yet the person receivesnegative karma for killing the fish.
Interdependent origination . The twelve links of causal connections which bind
beings to samsaric existence and thus perpetuate suffering: ignorance,karmic formation, consciousness, name and form, the six sense bases,contact, sensation, craving, grasping, becoming, rebirth, old age and death.These twelve links are like an uninterrupted vicious circle, a wheel thatspins all sentient beings around and around through the realms of samsara.
Jnana . (Tib. yeshe) Enlightened wisdom that is beyond dualistic thought.
Kanjur .  The preserved collection of the direct teaching of the Buddha.
Kagyu.  (Tib.) Ka means oral and gyu means lineage; the lineage of oral

Shantarakshita and is best known for coming to Tibet and with debatingand defeating the Chinese scholar Hashang Mahayana at Samyemonastery and then writing the Stages of Meditation .
Karma.  (Tib. lay) Literally “action.” The unerring law of cause and effect,
e.g., positive actions bring happiness and negative actions bring suffering.The actions of each sentient being are the causes that create the conditionsfor rebirth and the circumstances in that lifetime.
Karma Kagyu.  (Tib.) One of the eight schools of the Kagyu lineage of Tibetan
Buddhism which is headed by His Holiness Karmapa.
Karmapa . The name means Buddha activities. The Karmapas are the head of
the Kagyu school of Buddhism and were the first to implement thetradition of incarnate lamas. Karmapas are thought to be an emanationof the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara.
Karmic latencies or imprints.  (Skt. vasana , Tib. bakchak ) Every action that a
person does has an imprint which is stored in the eighth consciousness.These latencies express themselves later by leaving the eighth consciousnessand entering the sixth consciousness upon being stimulated by externalexperience.
Klesha . (Tib. nyön mong ) Also called the “disturbing emotions,” these are the
213
emotional afflictions or obscurations (in contrast to intellectual
obscurations) that disturb the clarity of perception. These are alsotranslated as “poisons.” They include any emotion that disturbs or distortsconsciousness. The three main kleshas are desire, anger and ignorance.The five kleshas are the three above plus pride and envy/jealousy.
Lama . (Skt. guru) La means nobody above himself or herself in spiritual
experience and ma means expressing compassion like a mother. Thus the

Luminosity. (Tib. osel) Literally “free from the darkness of unknowing and
endowed with the ability to cognize.” The two aspects are “emptyluminosity,” like a clear open sky; and “manifest luminosity,” such ascolored light images, and so forth. Luminosity is the uncompoundednature present throughout all of samsara and nirvana.
Madhyamaka . (Tib. u ma ) The most influential of the four schools of Indian
Buddhism founded by Nagarjuna in the second century C.E. The namecomes from the Sanskrit word meaning “the Middle-way” meaning thatit is the middle way between eternalism and nihilism. The main postulateof this school is that all phenomena – both internal mental events andexternal physical objects – are empty of any true nature. The school usesextensive rational reasoning to establish the emptiness of phenomena.This school does, however, hold that phenomena do exist on theconventional or relative level of reality.
Mahamudra . (Tib. cha ja chen po ) Literally means “great seal” or “great symbol,”
meaning that all phenomena are sealed by the primordially perfect truenature. This form of meditation is traced back to Saraha (tenth century)and was passed down in the Kagyu school through Marpa. This meditativetransmission emphasizes perceiving mind directly rather than throughrational analysis. It also refers to the experience of the practitioner whereone attains the union of emptiness and luminosity and also perceives theGlossary of T erms

sutras that all deal with the realization of prajna.
Prasangika school , or Consequence School. The Rangtong middle way has

This school hasfurther sub-schools, but basically its view is that relative truth refers towhat has only general characteristics: e.g., the objects of our thoughtssuch as when we think fire (this appears as a concept to our mind and notthe five senses); and ultimate truth is that which has specific characteristicsand can perform a function such as a specific instance of fire which appearsto the senses and can actually burn. In terms of general perception wemix these two together.

Selflessness.  (Tib. dag me ) Also called egolessness. In two of the Hinayana
schools (Vaibhashika and Sautrantika) this referred exclusively to the factthat “a person” is not a real permanent self, but rather just a collection ofthoughts and feelings. In two of the Mahayana schools (Cittamatra andMadhyamaka) this was extended to mean there was no inherent existenceto outside phenomena as well.

Buddha (the sutras ) and the commentaries of others on his works, the
shastras.
Shentong school . The Madhyamaka or Middle-way is divided into two major

Skandha . (Tib. pung pa ) Literally “heaps.” The five aspects which comprise
the physical and mental constituents of a sentient being: physical form,sensations, conceptions, formations and consciousness.

The sutras are mainly concerned with meditation orsamadhi; the Abhidharma is mainly concerned with the development ofwisdom and understanding; and the Vinaya is mainly concerned withdiscipline and the rules of morality and conduct. In the narrow sensesutra means one of these three sections of the Buddha’s teachings, and inits broad sense it means all of the teachings given by the Buddha.

Sutrayana.  The sutra approach to achieving enlightenment, which includes
the Hinayana and the Mahayana.
Svatantrika  or Autonomy School . The reason this school is called the autonomy
school is that they assert the autonomous existence of valid reasons thatprove their point. The Rangtong middle way has two main schools, theSvatantrika and the Prasangika. The Svatantrika has two main sub-schoolswhich both assert conventional reality to be like illusions, but do soaccording to either the sutra school or the Mind-only school. Ultimatereality, it asserts, is emptiness and free from conceptual fabrication.

Thus, this list of ten unwholesome acts occurs generally indiscussions of the functioning of karma. The first three are actions ofbody, the next four of speech, and the last three of mind. The ten virtuousactions are the opposites of the above ten non-virtuous actions.
T en stages . The stages or bodhisattva levels in the Mahayana path which are:
1) The Joyous One with an emphasis on generosity, 2) The Stainless Onewith an emphasis on discipline, 3) The Illuminating One with an emphasison patience, 4) The Flaming One with an emphasis on exertion, 5) TheOne Difficult to Conquer with an emphasis on samadhi, 6) The ManifestOne with an emphasis on wisdom, 7) The Far Going One with anemphasis on skilful activity, 8) The Unshakeable One with an emphasison future, 9) The One of Good Discrimination with an emphasis onefficacy, 10) Cloud of Dharma with an emphasis on accomplishingenlightenment.

CARE OF DHARMA  BOOKS
Dharma books contain the teachings of the Buddha. They have the
power to protect against lower rebirth and to point the way to liberation.Therefore, they should be treated with respect.
These considerations may be also kept in mind for Dharma artwork,
as well as the written teachings and artwork of other religions.
