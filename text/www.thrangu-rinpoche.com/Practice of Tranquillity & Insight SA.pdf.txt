ForewordThe foundation of Buddhist practice has al ways been the twofold development o f gaining an understanding of the Buddha’ s  teachings, on the one hand, and devel ­oping liberation from emotional and cognitive obscura­tions through the practice o f meditation, on the other hand. Unfortunately, there have been few books ex­plaining the latter process of why and how one medi­tates. This book by K henchen Thrangu, Rinpoche, lays out in detail how one develops the two principal kinds of meditation—samat ha and vi pasyana—from t he st age of begi nner t o t hat  of compl et e enl i ght enment .There are, of course, many manuals on meditation, but Thrangu Rinpoche chose the Treasury o f Knowledge for the basis of these teachings because its author, Jamgon Kongtriil, is widely known for synthesizing the knowledge and experience of many lineages in Tibet and for helping to found the Ri-me (ecumenical) move­ment. He i s  al so known for writing and compiling one hundred volumes of Nyingma and Kagyii teachings. When Thr angu Ri npoche r e f e r s  t o  “t he  t ext , ”  he  i s  actually referring to the eighth chapter of the first of the five books o f the Treasury o f Knowledge. This chapter has been translated by Kiki Edkelius and Chryssoula Zer- bini as The Treasury of Knowledge. B u t  t h e  c h a p t e r  i s  encyclopedic in that it encompasses the view and prac-Vll

Being encyclopedic, it condenses a vast am ount of information in each sentence and assumes that the reader has had extensive training in Buddhism. So, for Westerners to understand this great work, they need an extensive commentary from an accomplished scholar and Bud­dhist practitioner. Khenchen Thrangu is both of these.Thrangu Rinpoche taught t wo seminars on t hi s text— one at Worcester College in Oxford, England, in 1988 and the other in K athm andu, Nepal, in 1989. To develop this text, these two seminars were recorded, transcribed, and com bined into one book. The reason for combining the two different seminars was that Thrangu Rinpoche would emphasize certain points i n one seminar and other points in the other seminar. Extensive editing was therefore necessary, and it i s hoped that the resulting text is a thorough yet readable and understandable explanation of this very profound and complex topic.What  ma ke s  t h i s  comment ar y s o  v a l ua b l e  i s  t ha t  Thrangu Rinpoche i s  one of the foremost Tibetan schol­ars o f the same Kagyii lineage to which Jam gon Kong- triil belonged. T hrangu Rinpoche was trained in Tibet, and upon leaving Tibet in 1959 he continued his studies in India. He was then exam ined and given the highest geshe degree by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Following this he was asked by His Holiness the sixteenth K ar- mapa to establish the curriculum for training the Kagyii lineage and was the tutor for the four major regents: Tai Situpa Rinpoche, Gyaltsapa Rinpoche, Sharmapa Rin­poche, and Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche (who was a reincarnation of the author of the Treasury o f Knowledge).viii

As a result, this com m entary contains practical examples and insights from his expe­rience and training rather than just an erudite explana­tion of the text.Finally, to make this book more readable, Tibetan terms have been spelled according to the phonetic sys­tem.

The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty and Insig ht

1Introducti on to Tranqui lli ty and Insi ght Medi t a t i onhis teaching on meditation comes from a textcalled the Treasury o f Knowledge, o r  t h e  ShejaDzo i n  T i b e t a n .  T h i s  t e x t  i s  c a l l e d  a  t r e a s u r y  because the text has gathered together information from the sutras and tantras and presented it in a  concise form. It contains n o t only the actual teachings o f  the B uddhas, but also teachings on grammar, medicine, poetry, as­trology, and other subjects. Because the text covers so much, i t i s  al so cal l ed the Sheja Kiinkyab, wh i c h  me a n s  “t he t ext that c o v e r s  a l l  knowledge.”The author of the Treasury o f Knowledge was Jamgon Kongtriil (1813-1899). He was born to a  poor family, and his father died at the time of his birth, so his family consisted of just himself and his mother. At the time there was a very powerful king o f the kingdom  o f Derge who made hi s  s ubj e c t s  do hard manual  l abor f or  hi m.  Jamgon Kongtrul’ s  mother told him, “There is no point in leading this kind o f life, w hich will be m ostly suffer­ing. It is m uch better if you enter the dharma and become a m o n k .” H is m o th e r thus sent h im  to a m onastery, where he became ordained and studied hard and became a pupil o f  the n in th  Tai Situpa, Pem a N yingje W angpo. Jamgon Kongtriil was a good student and writer, and1

when the king of Derge heard of hi s  s ki l l s,  he wanted to m ake him  his personal secretary. But Pema Nyingje thought, “If he is just an ordinary m onk, the king will be able to take him away, and he will waste his time with temporal matters a s  a  secret ary.  However ,  if he i s  declared a tiilku, t he ki ng wi l l  not  be  a b l e  t o h a v e  hi m a s  a secretary.” T h e p ro b lem  was that he had to be the reincarnation of someone to be identified as a tiilku. So Pema Nyingje thought it would be a good idea to call him the tiilku of Kongpo Pamden. This would be con­venient because Kongpo Pamden had been such a good meditator. Therefore, they g a v e  Jamgon Kongtriil the name Kongpo Pamden Tiilku, and this was shortened to Kongtriil. T hat is how  Jam gon Kongtriil got his name.So Jam gon Kongtriil was declared a tiilku and lived in a cabin on a large rock above Palpung. T his rock is called Tsadra Rinchen Drak. Rinchen drak me a n s  “pr e ­cious rock” or “jewel rock,” and tsadra me a n s  “s i mi l a r  to T sari.” Tsari and M ount Kailash are two very sacred places in Tibet. Tsadra Rinchen D rak was recognized by the terton C h o j y u r  L i n g p a ,  s o  t h i s  i s  a  v e r y  s p e c i a l  place. W hen one looks at the northern face of the rock, one can see the form of the deity Dorje Phurba (Skt. Vhjrakilaya) o n  t h e  r o c k .  J a m g o n  K o n g t r i i l  h a d  a  l i t t l e  house built in the area of the heart of this form of Dorje Phurba, and he stayed there meditating in retreat. In his life story he says that he was there alone in a state o f poverty, with nothing other than one bag of tsampa (roasted barley) and a single brick of tea.At the time there were many lineages in Tibet— some with many l i neage holders and some with only a  f ew holders. To prevent these lineages from dying out,The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

IntroductionJamgon Kongtriil collected the teachings of all these lineages and assembled them  into five texts called the Five Treasuries. T h e  Treasury o f Knowledge, t h e  w o r k  w e  are dealing w ith here, is just one of* the five, jam gon Kongtriil assembled these treasuries gradually. But then it was discovered that a sutra says, “There will com e a guide called Lodro who will teach the five kinds of knowledge.” The word lodro m e a n s  “ i n t e l l i g e n c e ”  i n  Tibetan, and this was actually Jamgon Kongtriil’ s  name. The f i ve  kinds of knowledge refer to the f i ve  treasuries. So Jam gon Kongtriil composed these five treasuries, and great scholars have recognized the prophecy of the sutra as indeed being about Jam gon Kongtriil.Jamgon Kongtriil became the teacher of the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje, which i s  a  very special distinction. In the Treasury o f Knowledge are teachings on all levels, including the sutras and the tantras. There are also teachings on w hat to do at each o f these levels, how to develop one’s m editation at these levels, and so on.Why One Shoul d P r a c t i c e  Medi t at i onJamgon Kongtriil begins by answering the question of why one medi t at es.  I n Sanskr i t  medi t at i on i s  samadhi, a  word translated a s  ting nge dzin1 i n  T i b e t a n .  T h e  s y l l a b l e  dzin me a ns  “t o hol d, ”  a nd t he  s y l l a b l e  nge i s  an adverb making t he meani ng “t o hol d something unwaver i ngl y,  firmly, so that there is no m ovem ent.” This means that during meditation the mind does not fall under the influence o f thoughts, obscurations, or mental negativ­ity (Skt. klesa, T i b .  nyonmong). I n s t e a d  i t  i s  c o m p l e t e l y  stable and unwavering. Samadhi is translated as gom i n  Tibetan. This word i s  very close to kom,2 which means3

“t o become accustomed t o doing something,” s o that i t  becomes a part of oneself. Meditation is very similar to familiarization because one continues meditating even if it som etim es doesn’t go well. Obstacles and problem s often arise, but one continues and habituates oneself to medi t at i ng unt i l  i t  becomes e as y and nat ur al .  S o  through habituation one is able to remain in the state of meditation.Samadhi includes tranquillity meditation, or samatha, and insight meditation, or vipasyana. After receiving the teachings for these two types o f m editation, one needs to analyze them  w ith one’ s intelligence in order to gain a d efin ite u n d e rs ta n d in g  o f  th e m . A fte r g a in in g  an understanding of these two, it is necessary to practice and meditate so that what one has learned becomes absorbed by the mind. Even if one knows a great deal about dharma, it will be of no help if one does not understand samatha and vipasyana meditation. There­fore, one m ust practice meditation so that w hat is conceptually learned,  becomes a part of oneself. Thus we must examine meditation first.There are several level s of understanding. From hear­ing the Buddhist teachings one develops the understand­ing o f listening; from t hi nki ng about  t h e s e  t e ac hi ngs  one  develops the understanding of contemplation. These two are not enough to develop full understanding because one must turn one’ s  mi nd inward t o gai n t he underst andi ng that comes from  meditation. Instead o f focusing the mind ext ernal l y by l i st eni ng t o t he t eachi ngs,  one fo­cuses one’s attention internally on the m ind itself to develop understanding o f meditation. O n e  c a n n o t  b e n e f i t  much from focusi ng on ext ernal  phenomena because the m ind is bound up by the klesas, and the only wayThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

Introductionto free oneself from  the bondage o f klesas is to turn inward through meditation.Jamgon Kongtriil gives two examples illustrating the necessity for meditation. One is the example of a farmer. For a farmer to be happy and well fed, he must plant a field, work hard, and get a good harvest. To have a good crop in the field is not enough; he m ust harvest it and eat it. Similarly, just listening to the teachings and contemplating them is not enough; one must med­itate to dispel the negativity in one’ s m ind and develop inner wisdom . In the second example, borrowed from  Santideva, a doctor must have knowledge of the medi­cines and their proper application, which is gained through the study of medical books. But just reading medical books will not eliminate disease; the patient must  t ake t he medi ci nes  des cr i bed i n t he t e xt s .  Si mi ­larly, just listening to and contem plating the dharm a is not enough because it will not quell the klesas and calm the mind. To develop the qualities o f wisdom , one m ust practice meditation. To practice meditation means to habituate oneself to meditation. If one’ s  mind is peaceful and happy in ordinary life, all external things appear pleasant and attractive; if one’ s  mind is disturbed and unhappy, all these external things seem unpleasant and not right. One needs to make the mind peaceful and happy to develop inner wisdom, and this i s  done by meditation.Samadhi, the state of deep meditation, is composed of t wo el ement s:  samatha and vi pasyana.  There a r e ,  i n fact, a great num ber o f m editation techniques, but they can all be included in these two categories. In the Definite Explanation of the View s u t r a  t h e  B u d d h a  s a y s  there are the samadhis of the sravakas, w h o  a r e  t h e5

followers of the hïnayâna, a n d  t h e r e  a r e  t h e  s a mâ d h i s  of  the bodhisattvas, wh o  a r e  t h e  f o l l o w e r s  of  t h e  mahâyâna, and there are the samâdhis of the tathdgatas ( t h e  b u d -  dhas), who have followed meditation to its completion. All these can be included in two kinds of samâdhis: samatha and vipasyanâ. Having understood that all medi t at i on comes from samat ha and vi pasyanâ,  one should prepare oneself to do these meditations. One should also seek out specific instructions to practice them. The purpose o f practicing samatha and vipasyanâ in the hïnayâna is to achieve happiness and various special qualities. In the mahâyâna the purpose of medi­tation is to benefit all beings, so this view has a wider viewpoint and requires greater motivation. This is why the mahâyâna is called the “greater” vehicle. In Bud­dhism the results of the hïnayâna and the mahâyâna come from the practice of samatha and vipasyanâ. The attaining of day-to-day happiness is also the result of samatha and vipasyanâ.Many i ndi vi dua l s  whom I  h a v e  met  i n  my e x t e n s i v e  travels in Europe and N orth Am erica have told m e their private problems— mental problems, physical prob­lems, and unhappiness w ith their possessions or their work. The answer to the multitude of these problems i s  always the same: to make one’s m ind peaceful and calm and develop understanding and wisdom. So ordinary worldly happiness comes down to practicing samatha and vipasyanâ. The Definite Explanation of the View sütra says that the root o f the accom plishm ent o f the goal o f all w orldly and spiritual activity is sam atha and vipa­syanâ meditation. This sütra consists of the Buddha and Mai t r eya conver si ng i n t he form of quest i ons and an­swers. In this sütra the Buddha says to M aitreya thatThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

Introduction
whatever worldly or spiritual qualities are possessed by 
the sravakas, the bodhisattvas, or the tathagatas are all 
the result o f samatha and vipasyana. This explains the 
importance of samatha and vipasyana because they are 
the root o f all meditation. Knowing this, one should 
develop a great interest in practicing these two kinds of 
meditation.
The Essential Nature of Samatha and Vipasyana
Samatha is actually the mind resting one-pointedly on 
an object so that not many thoughts arise and the mind 
becomes very stable and calm. The mind rests in peace. 
The Tibetan for samatha  i s  shi-ne,  me a ni ng “pe a c e . ”3  S o  
samatha is “resting in peace.” Simply keeping the mind 
one-pointed i s not samatha meditation because in true 
samatha, the object one focuses on should be something 
positive. A negative object would be something that 
causes attachment, aggression, or ignorance to arise in 
the mind, m aking it unable to rest calmly on something. 
Resting on something genuinely positive allows the 
mind t o r est  i n p e a c e .  Samat ha i s  pr act i ced t o pr event  
the arising o f so m any thoughts. O ne m ight think that 
samatha is a state of no thoughts, perhaps like that of a 
stone. This is incorrect because in samatha meditation 
the m ind is very calm and stable and also very clear so 
that it can distinguish and discriminate between all 
phenomena and see everything as very distinct. This 
clarity is called vipasyana, or insight,  a n d  i s  d e v e l o p e d  
through samatha.
The nature or identity of samatha i s  described in the 
Cloud of Jewels  sutra. It says that if one’ s  mind has many 
thoughts, one cannot focus on the object of attention.
7

The mind cannot focus on something because of the distraction of thoughts. If the mind can focus one- pointedly without this distraction, one has samatha meditation. The sutra al so s a y s  that vipasyana has the clarity of understanding in which everything is seen clearly and distinctly; the relative is seen as relative, the absolute as absolute. So the actual nature of things is seen as it is, and this is w hat is m eant by vipasyana. A commentary on the Cloud of Jewels sutra was composed by Vasubandhu, who was a great master of the abhi- dharma. V a s u b a n d h u  s a i d  t h a t  i n  g e n u i n e  s a m a t h a  t h e  mi nd i s  a b l e  t o r est  i n t he mi nd.  The mi nd becomes s o  relaxed that it rests in itself, just as it is, in a natural way, undistracted by thoughts. “Distracted” in Tibetan is yengwa, w h i c h  m e a n s  “ s w e p t  a w a y . ”  T h e  w o r d  dis­tracted in this context has in it the connotation of being carried away with no control by a strong river. In the same way, one’ s m ind cannot stay still and is just carried away. If the m ind is resting in the mind, it is just w here it is, and the m ind becomes stable and peaceful and relaxed. The Cloud of Jewels sutra s a ys ,  “Samatha i s  the one-pointed mind,” and Vasubandhu’ s  commentary ex­plains that vipasyana is “the discrimination of phenom ­ena,” meaning that all things appear as very clear and distinct from one another. So this is the nature of vipasyana. With samatha and vipasyana one has a gen­uine state of meditation with the mind resting in mind and being able to distinguish all phenomena. W ithout samatha and vipasyana one does not have a genuine samadhi or meditation state.The third text cited by Jamgon Kongtriil comes from Kamalasila. In the eighth century Santaraksita came to Tibet and taught the stages of meditation. Owing to hisThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

Introductionclairvoyance, he knew that he would soon pass away. So he said, “I have given these teachings. In the future, problems may occur and things might go wrong. When this happens, invite m y pupil Kamalaslla from  India. He will be able to explain meditation clearly and remove any errors in interpretation that might arise.” This was his last wish, and then he passed away.Then f r o m Ch i n a  a  Ch i n e s e  ma s t e r  n a me d  Ha s h a n g  Mahayana came t o Ti bet  and s a i d ,  “You' have been receiving these teachings from  Santaraksita, but these teachings are on the gradual path. This is not the profound way and i s  very difficult to do and takes a  long time. My teachings are the instantaneous way and are easier and faster than the gradual way. W hether a good thought or a  bad thought comes to mind makes no difference. If one has a white cloud, it obscures the sun; if one has a black cloud, it also obscures the sun. If one is bitten by a white dog, one will have teeth marks; if one is bitten by a black dog; one will also have teeth marks. If a  good thought ar i s es ,  i t  i s  not good; if a  bad thought arises, it is not bad. Instead one needs to rest in a state o f no thoughts whatsoever.” Such are the teachings he gave, and the people o f Tibet became confused and did not know the correct way to meditate. Then they remembered what Santaraksita had sai d and invited Kamalaslla from India to clear up these m isun­derstandings.In fact, there is nothing w rong w ith H ashang’ s teach­ings except that they did not include the development of l o v e  and compassi on and t he accumul at i on of meri t  through good actions. In his system, one just stopped all thoughts and meditated. W hen Kamalaslla arrived in Tibet, he wanted to know whether Hashang was intel­9

ligent or not. If he w asn’t intelligent, then there 
wouldn’ t  be  any point i n debat i ng with hi m.  Now, ,  near  
Samye Monastery in Tibet is the great Tsangpo River, 
which i s  act uall y the upper part of the Brahmaputra 
River. It is very wide. On one side of the river stood 
Kamalasila and on the other side, Hashang Mahayana. 
To determ ine how intelligent Hashang was, Kamalasila 
took his staff and whirled it above his head three times. 
This was to symbolically ask the question, “Where do 
the three realms of samsara  c ome  f r om?”  Has hang Ma­
hayana was intelligent and held up his two hands, which 
were covered by the long sleeves of his cloak. This 
meant, “They come from ignorance, which grasps the 
dualism of perceiver and perception. ” When Kamalasila 
saw this answer, he set up a debate to be held at Samye 
Monast ery.  The king of Tibet presi ded ove r  t he debat e 
and brought flower garlands. The king said that previ­
ously the mahapandita  S a n t a r a k s i t a  h a d  c o me  a n d  g i v e n  
teachings; later H ashang M ahayana came and gave 
teachings that were not the same as Santaraksita’s. The 
king then said, “I  am just an ordinary being and cannot 
tell w ho is correct, so we will have a debate in w hich 
you will ask each other questions. If someone is defeated 
in the debate, he should give these garlands to the 
victor. He should then accept defeat gracefully and leave 
quietly without any fuss or resentment.” They then 
held a debate asking each other questions. In the end 
Hashang Mahayana lost the debate and presented the 
flower garlands to Kamalasila. W hen this was done, 
Kamalasila gave teachings on meditation that can be 
found in his Stages of Meditation.  I n  t h e  Treasury o f

IntroductionThe second volume of the Stages o f Meditation d e ­scribes the nature of samatha meditation. In samatha the mind i s  cont i nuousl y f ocused i nward s o  t hat  i t  becomes very peaceful and all external distractions are pacified. The obstacle t o samatha i s  external distractions such a s  sight, sound, and taste. The development of samatha occurs when the mind is continuously turned inward and naturally rests in that state. Kamalaslla says that there are two characteristics that arise from  samatha. The first characteristic i s  attraction to samatha because one feels it is important and naturally does it because of a state o fjo y . T h e second is that the m in d  is “ com pletely trained/’  which means one isn’ t battling with thoughts or distractions. One can rest one’ s  mind on what one wishes without any conflict. So these are the two quali­ties o f sam atha m editation.In sum m ary, w hen one achieves samatha, one is not in a state o f dullness or stupor. W hen samatha is devel­oped, one eliminates distracting thoughts that keep one from being able to examine or analyze things. Remov­ing the distraction of thoughts leads to perceiving things very clearly and distinctly, which is vipašyaná. This is how Kamalaslla describes the nature of samatha and vipašyaná.Etymology of Samatha and VipašyanáThe Sanskrit word for samatha w a s  t r a n s l a t e d  i n t o  Ti ­betan as shi-ne. Thi s  wa s  a  l i t e r a l  t r a ns l a t i on b e c a u s e  t h e  first two syllables, sama, mean “peace, ”  a nd t he  Ti bet an shiwa a l s o  m e a n s  “ p e a c e . ”  T h i s  p e a c e  m e a n s  t h a t  t h e  mi nd i s  not  di st r act ed becaus e when t he mi nd i s  o ve r ­come with anger, sadness, regret, or craving, it becomes

distracted. But in samatha the mind is very relaxed and at ease w ithout any difficulties or hardships. The third syllable, tha, means “t o dwel l ”  or “stabilit y.”  I n Tibetan “t o dwell” i s  tiepa. I n  t h i s  c o n t e x t  i t  m e a n s  t h a t  t h e  mi nd i s  not  i nvol ved i n f orced act i vi t y or di f f i cul t i es  but dwells in a state of peace. In Tibetan this is the ne in shi­ne. T h e r e  a r e  m a n y  d i f f e r e n t  k i n d s  o f  s a m a d h i s ,  o r  meditative states, but samatha i s  the basis of a l l  the meditative states in which the mind i s  resting one- pointedly on something and remains completely fo­cused on that object.The Sanskrit word vipasyana is made up of two parts. The first part, vi, i s  s h o r t  f o r  visesa, w h i c h  m e a n s  “special,” “superior,” or “particular.” The second part, pasyana, m e a n s  “ t o  s e e ”  o r  “ t o  l o o k . ”  S o  vipasyana means “to look at things in a  very direct way, in an especially clear way.” It is seeing with the eyes of wisdom. This was translated into Tibetan a s  hlagtong, where hlag means “special” and tong means “to see.”The Necessity of Both Samatha and VipasyanaOne might t hink t hat i t  i s  possi bl e t o pract i ce samat ha alone or practice vipasyana without doing any samatha. But in fact, whatever Buddhist practices one does, one must pr act i ce both samat ha and vi pasyana meditation together. This is illustrated by the example o f a butter lamp, which Tibetans used in the past to illuminate the darkness. A butter lam p’ s light is very clear and bright. For a lamp to give light it must have the qualities of being steady and not blown by the wind. If the flame is not bright or steady, one won’ t see things in the dark. In the same way, to see the true nature o f phenom ena,The Practice of Tranquillity & I n s i g h t

Introductionone has to have a clear understanding and be able to focus the m ind on the object for as long as is necessary. If either of these is missing, then the true nature of things cannot be perceived. O ne needs to have both samatha (the unwavering light) and vipasyana (the bright flame). With both, one has complete freedom to focus on anything and is able to eliminate all klesas and develop the wisdom  that one needs. If one practices samatha meditation without vipasyana, one will not be able to understand the true nature of phenomena; one will just be able to rest the mind on something. I t  i s  like being on a vacation; one experiences peace on a vaca­tion, but one does not get any lasting results from  it.If you practice vipasyana without samatha, you will not be able to eliminate whatever negativity needs to be eliminated, because vipasyana without samatha is unsta­ble. So even if you have the understanding of vipasyana, your mind will be agitated. Therefore, you need to have both samatha and vipasyana. This has been said by the Buddha i n the sutras and al so in the vajrayana teachings.The Progressive Order of MeditationThe next question i s :  Does one start with samatha, or wi t h vi pa s ya na,  or  wi t h bot h a t  t he s a me  t i me ?  The answer is that one starts with samatha and then does vipasyana practice because samatha is the basis of medi­tation and vipasyana is based upon samatha. In the example of the butter lamp, samatha is like the butter or oil and vipasyana is like the wick placed in the oil. If one doesn’ t have any oil and tries to light the lamp, one won’ t  get  a  good f l a me .  But  if one h a s  o i l  i n t he l amp,  one gets a good steady, bright flame. Similarly, one13

needs to establish samatha meditation and then develop 
vipasyana meditation.
Santideva was a great scholar and siddha  in India who, 
being blessed by Manjusri, composed A Gu i d e  t o  t h e  
Bodhisattva’ s Way of Life.  I n  t h i s  w o r k  h e  d e s c r i b e s  e a c h  
of the si x perfect i ons,  or paramitds.  S a n t i d e v a  s a y s  o n e  
needs to have vipasyana that is based on samatha medi­
tation— a very peaceful samatha— to which one has be­
come completely familiarized and accustomed. If we 
have vipasyana that possesses this very good sam atha 
meditation, we will be able to overcome the kl esas.  
Therefore, we need to begin first with samatha medita­
tion. In the chapter on the paramita o f meditation, 
Santideva says the essence of vipasyana is seeing all 
things undistractedly and very clearly. This discriminat­
ing w isdom  (Skt. pratyaveksanapmjha)  s e e s  r e l a t i v e  p h e ­
nomena a s being relative.
So with discriminating wisdom  we can see the actual, 
true nature o f mind, just as it is. But before this can 
happen, our mind must be workable, which means that 
we can do whatever we want with the mind— if we want 
to send it som ew here, it will go; if we w ant to leave it 
in a particular spot, it will stay there. As we know  from  
experience, our mind normally acts as if it belongs to 
someone else— it just wanders off somewhere by itself. 
So we need to have complete control of our m ind in 
order to see the nature of things with the understanding 
of vi pasyana.The P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsight

2/ _Samatha: Tranqui lli ty Medi t a t i onThe Prerequisites for Practicing SamathaThere are favorable conditions for meditation, and if these are present, samatha will develop. If they are absent, no samatha will develop.When t he  dhar ma wa s  f i r s t  i nt r oduced i nt o Ti bet  i n  the seventh century, there was a good understanding and practice of the dharma. Later Langdarma, a king of Tibet, suppressed the dharma in the tenth century and destroyed much of the Buddhist teachings. After this destruction, some of the dharma was preserved, but some of the preserved teachings were incorrectly prac­ticed. As a result the Tibetans were no longer sure w ho was giving the correct teachings. So in 1042 Atisa was invited to Tibet from  India because he was believed to be the most qualified person to teach the correct way of practicing. Atisa also received a revelation and prophecy from  Tara saying that if he went to Tibet, this would be of great  benefi t  to the dharma.Upon arri vi ng i n Ti bet ,  At i s a  g a v e  t eachi ngs  on t he methods of samat ha and vi pasyanâ medi t at i on.  These teachings can be found in his book Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment. I n  t h i s  t e x t  h e  s a y s  t h a t  t o  d o  s a m a t h a  meditation one needs t o h a v e  f a vor a bl e  condi t i ons.  Even17

if one is diligent and applies oneself for many years to samatha meditation, if these favorable conditions are lacking, one will fail to develop real samatha meditation. However, he also says that if all the favorable conditions are present and one concentrates the mind on som ething good and positive, then one will be able to accomplish samatha meditation and be able to develop clairvoyant powers.In his second volum e o f the Stages o f Meditation Ka -  malaslla says that (i) one should reside in a favorable place— a place where one can obtain the materials one needs. In terms of mind, (2) one shouldn’ t have a great deal of desire, thinking, “Oh, I need this to meditate; no, I need two or three things to meditate,” and so on. This kind of thinking will only create an obstacle. ( 3 )  One must a l s o  be cont ent ,  which means what ever  one has is fine and all right. (4) One should also give up activities such as business or buying and selling so that(5) one can have pure, g o o d  conduct. So, (6) w h e n  one stays and meditates in this place, it is com pletely correct. (7) O n e should also avoid any distractions or desires that appear as well as ideas and concepts. This, then, is a list of s e ven conditions necessary for t he development of samatha.In the Ornament of the Mahay ana Sutras, Mai t r eya s a y s  that we should practice where we can easily obtain the necessities such as clothing, food, and so on. The place where we s t a y should be f r ee from t hi e ve s  or any f ear  of danger. We should be in a healthy place that is not extremely cold or hot or damp and will not impair our health. We also need good companions who have the same view and behavior as ourselves. If they have a different view or way of life, they will prevent us fromThe Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insight

gaining stability of mind. The place where we stay 
should also be free from a lot of activity and a large 
number of people. These are the outer conditions of 
where we should s t a y .  This sutra a l s o descr i bes the inner 
conditions of mind, namely, lack of desire, content­
ment, and reducing involvement i n too many act i vi t i es.  
Finally, it describes the point between mind and the 
outer world, which i s our conduct or behavior. We 
should have peaceful and gentle conduct in accordance 
with t he pratimoksa  v o w s  o r  t h e  b o d h i s a t t v a  v o w .  Th e  
pratimoksa vows are prohibitions against such acts as 
killing, stealing, and adultery. The main idea is that if 
we do any of these negative actions, our mind will not 
be able to rest in a natural peaceful state. In terms of the 
bodhisattva vow, if we have anger, jealousy, aversion, 
and so on, then our mind will not be able to rest in a 
peaceful state. Instead, we need to develop love and 
compassion for all sentient beings. So if this interface 
between inner and outer leads to benefiting other be­
ings, then favorable conditions for samatha will develop.
Categories o f Samatha
There are four kinds of samatha meditation. The first i s  
called desire realm  s a m a t h a .  O n e  m a k e s  t h e  m i n d  s o  
relaxed that it becomes completely stable and peaceful. 
Next i s  dhyana  s a ma t ha,  or  s amat ha of ment al  s t a bi l i t y

reach a state where mind ceases and mental continuity stops.More pr eci s el y,  t her e a r e  ni ne s t a ge s  of s amat ha.  First, in the desire realm, there is the one-pointed sama­tha, which means that one does not have com plete mental stability, but one has a  certain amount of mental stability so that one is not distracted by external objects.Next, in the form realm, there are four successive levels o f sam atha m editation. T he first is sam atha w ith examination and analysis. The s e c o n d  i s  s a ma t ha  wi t h joy and bliss. Th e  t h i r d  i s  s a ma t h a  wi t h  inhalation and exha­lation.

The remaini ng s i x ar e def ect s of t he previous three levels of samatha in the form realm: (3) analysis, (4) examination, (5) joy, (6) bliss, (7) inhala­tion, and (8) exhalation. Freedom from  inhalation and exhalation means that in that state one is completely still w ithout any breathing. So there are these four levels of samatha meditation i n the form realm.There are four states of meditation that belong to the formless realm, which is a state like that of emptiness, but not the emptiness (siinyata) of  t h e  Ma d h y a ma k a .  I t  is ju st a void or blank in w hich nothing is perceived or focused on. There are four stages of samatha in this formless realm. These are the samatha of infinite space, the samatha o f infinite consciousness, t h e  s a m a t h a  o f  nei­ther existence nor nonexistence, a n d  t h e  s a ma t h a  of nothing whatsoever. A l l  t o g e t h e r ,  t h e n ,  t h e r e  a r e  n i n e  s t a g e s  o f  samatha meditation: one in the desire realm, four in the form realm, and four in the formless realm.The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

Samatha: Tranquillity Meditation PostureThere are two ways to describe posture during medita­tion: the seven aspects of posture of Vairocana and the five aspects o f dhyana m editation. In this section I shall describe the seven aspects of Vairocana. -  Vairocana means “what ill uminates,  what makes clear.”  So  Vai rocana i s  the physical posture of sitting that helps one develop a meditative state and makes the mind stable and cl ear .  Whet her  t h e  mi nd be c ome s  u n s t a b l e  d e p e n d s  on what  are called the airs or subtle winds (Skt. vayii, Ti b.  lung). There i s  the gross air, which i s  the breath one inhales and exhales. But there is also a subtle air, which is involved w ith the movements o f the body and the movement of thoughts. Body and mind ar e r el at ed,  s o  when t hese subtle a i r s  become s t i l l  i n t he body, the mind a l s o  becomes s t i l l .  One makes  t he s e  subt l e a i r s  stable by working on the inner channels (Skt. nadT, Tib.  tsa) t h r o u g h  w h i c h  t h e  a i r s  m o v e .  I f  t h e s e  c h a n n e l s  a r e  straight and stable, the subtle airs will become stable, and then the mind will become stable. To make these channels straight and stable, one must have proper pos­ture during meditation.There are several  different kinds of subtle ai rs,  or vayus. T h e  s u b t l e  a i r  t h a t  m a k e s  t h e  b o d y  s t a b l e  a n d  firm is the subtle air o f earth. The s ubt l e  a i r  t hat  k e e p s  t he  body warm i s  the subtle air o f fire. T h e  s u b t l e  a i r  t h a t  keeps the body from drying up is the subtle air o f water. The subtle ai r that spreads warmth throughout the whole body and caus e s  physical  movement i s  cal l ed the subtle air o f air (the lung of lung in Tibetan). So one has a  subtle air for each of the four elements. There is also a fifth, downward-eliminating air, w h i c h  t r a n s f o r m s  t h e

food in the stomach, separates the waste m atter from 
the food, and expels the waste through the anus.5
The first aspect of the Vai rocana posture i s  (i) keeping 
the spine straight so that the central energy channel is 
straight. The life-force vayu is called prana  (Tib. soklung ) 
and flows in the central channel. Prana makes one’ s  
body stable and firm. I t  i s  also called the earth vayu 
because it gives stability and endurance to the body. If 
the body is bent forward in meditation, or leaning to 
the left, right, or backward, then this central channel is 
going to be bent and the prana flowing within it will be 
constricted. Therefore if one keeps the spine straight, 
the earth vayu will flow straight, and this will result in 
endurance and stability.
The water vayu permeates the body and keeps i t  
moist. If these water vayus flow in the central channel, 
they will naturally be stable. In order to cause the water 
vayu to flow in the central channel, (2) one places the 
hands in a meditative posture (3) with the elbows 
slightly sticking out. The fire vayu naturally goes up­
ward, while the earth and water vayu naturally go 
downward. For the fire vayu to enter the central chan­
nel, (4) one lowers the chin slightly, which has the effect 
of prevent i ng t he f i r e vayu from r i si ng upward.
To introduce the air vayu into the central channel, (5) 
one’ s  eyes should be unwavering. The air vayu i s  con­
nected with movement of the body, and the eyes natu­
rally have a great deal o f movement associated w ith 
them. The moving o f the eyes will cause the m ind to 
move. So one keeps the eyes still, focused on the space 
beyond the tip of the nose. This will cause the mind to 
become still and the air vayu to enter the central channel.
(6) T h e lips are also left to rest quite naturally, w ith  theThe P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsight

tongue resting against the palate. To stabilize the down­
ward-eliminating vayu,  ( 7 )  one s i t s  with one’ s  l egs in 
the vajra  ( f ul l - l ot us)  post ure.
The first f i ve  aspects of posture rel at e to the f i ve 
vayus, but the air vayu has two aspects, the eyes and the 
lips. T he w ater vayu also has two aspects, w ith the 
hands in the meditation posture and the upper arms 
being extended, totaling seven aspects of meditation 
posture. Many instructions say that one should expel 
the dead air three times before beginning m editation 
because with normal breathing, one’ s body accumulates 
im pure or negative air. To get rid of this, one exhales 
with more f orce than us ual ,  but not with a  great  de al  of 
force. W hile doing this, one thinks that all the mental 
negativities, the klesas, are being exhaled with the 
breath, and one inhales in a very relaxed way. This is 
done three times: first with slightly greater strength 
than normal, second with still greater strength, and 
third with even more strength. After this one breathes 
normally, very relaxed, thinking that one has expelled 
all the negativities.
The hands in meditation should be resting i n the 
medi t at i on post ure or l i t er al l y “rest i ng i n t he equal i t y 
posture.” You can rest the right hand on top of the left 
hand because “resting equally” means your hands are at 
the same level, so that if one hand is on the knee, then 
the other should be on the other knee at the same level. 
It d o esn ’t m ake any difference; use w hichever one y ou 
find comfortable.
In the mahdmudra  tradition of the vajrayana, the seven 
aspects of the posture of Vairocana just discussed are 
usually given. But Jamgon Kongtriil uses the eight as­
pects of posture given by Kamalasila in his Stages o fSamatha: Tranquillity Meditation
23

Meditation.  T o  b e g i n  w i t h ,  y o u  s h o u l d  s i t  c o m f o r t a b l y  
and follow these eight points.
First, your legs should be fully crossed in the vajra 
posture or in the semi-crossed (half-lotus) posture. You 
should be relaxed; you don’ t have to force yourself into 
the vajra posture. In the West not everyone can sit cross- 
legged. Some people sit w ith the knees sticking up, but 
eventually the knees will come down. This is accom­
plished with the achievement of suppleness of body. It 
is better to sit com fortably than to sit in pain.
Second, your eyes should be half-closed, which 
means they should be neither wide open and staring 
ahead nor fully closed so that everything is dark. They 
are kept half-closed w ithout any effort or tension so 
that they are completely relaxed and you don’t have to 
think about them.
Third, the upper body should be straight. Since the 
body and mind are interconnected, if the body i s  
straight, these channels are straight, the subtle energies 
will flow smoothly in them, and the mind will become 
still and stable. If the body is bent, the channels becom e 
blocked and the mind is adversely affected because some 
channels will have little energy moving in them and 
other channels will have rapidly moving energy, which 
results in a host o f thoughts arising in the mind.
Fourth, the shoulders should be level and the body 
upright, and you should not lean to the left or right.
Fifth, you should be looking downward toward the 
nose. Your gaze should be toward the nose so that you 
are aware o f your nose. The classical description is that 
the gaze should be four fm ger-w idths beyond the nose.
Sixth, there should be a slight gap between the lipsThe P racti ce  of T ran qu i lli ty  &  I nsight
24

and teeth because if the teeth are held against one another, they can create grinding sounds.Seventh, the tongue should be against the palate. Otherwise, s a l i va  wi l l  accumul ate i n t he mouth and you will be distracted by swallowing.Finally, the breathing should be effortless and natural. You should not try to suppress the breath or force deep breaths.Each of these eight aspects of posture, such as keeping the eyes half-closed, may individually seem rather un­important, but to develop complete clarity and stability of mind,  a l l  t hese as pect s  of posture ar e act ual l y impor­tant because each has a special purpose in bringing about stability and clarity.6Four Objects o f MeditationThere are two explanations of how to hold the mind i n meditation. The f i r st  i s  a  general  descri pt i on,  and t he second is a specific set of stages of meditation.In the general explanation, the Buddha taught that there are four classes of objects of meditation. The first is the all-pervasive object o f  m e d i t a t i o n .  I t  i s  s o  c a l l e d  because it applies to all phenomena. This object can be focused on w ithout analysis, with the mind simply resting, or with analysis, where one is looking at either the actual nature of phenom ena or their relative m ulti­plicity.The second cl as s  of object s of meditation i s  the paci­fication o f behavior. Thi s i s  medi t at i on t hat  pur i f i es  f a u l t s .  Wher e do t he s e  ne gat i ve  pat t er ns  come f r om?  I n  t he Buddhist teaching, our present l ife originates from a  previous life. That previous life came from a life beforeSamatha: Tranquillity Meditation
25

that, and so on. D uring our present life, we can experi­ence physical pain and mental suffering, or we can experience happiness and bliss. These experiences come from our actions in a previous life. They are the result of karma. H o w e v e r ,  n o t  e v e r y t h i n g  i s  d u e  t o  k a r m a .  Some people have great desire or great anger, and this mi ght  come from t he power  of habi t uat i on i n a  pr evi ous  life and not as a result o f karm a. O ne m ight have become habituated to desire or anger, and these emo­tions become greater and greater, so that in the next life there will be great desire or great anger. O r in one lifetime we may encounter a remedy for this desire or anger, and this will lessen our faults, which may con­tinue to lessen through successive lifetimes. So if we were accustomed to a  lot of desire in our previous lives, then there will be a lot o f desire in our present life. If we were accustomed to a lot of anger in our previous lives, we w ill experience a lot o f anger in this lifetime. If we were accustomed to having many thoughts in our previous lives, our present mind will not be able to remain stable; thoughts will take over our mind, and we will be under their power. Finally, if we had strong ignorance in our previous lifetime, we will have becom e accustomed to this, and our present mind will contain a  lot of ignorance. So these patterns describe the five types o f persons (those w ith great attachm ent, anger, ignorance, jealousy, and pride), and meditation is done to rem edy these five kinds o f mentality.If we have strong desire and attachment to our own body or to external things, we can practice meditation on ugliness. We normally see our body as solid, lasting, and important; but the Buddha taught that we have a precious human existence, which allows us to practiceThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
26

the dharm a and benefit other beings. It is a precious human existence, but the body itself i s  not precious. We meditate on t he obj ect  of our attachment,  seei ng that it is not beautiful, solid, or lasting. This lessens our attachment.If we have a great deal of anger, we meditate on love or compassion, which will lessen our anger. Anger normally i s the desire to harm someone else. Instead we do the meditation of taking our own body as an example for all other beings. Normally, if we experience the slightest am ount of pain, it is undesirable, and if we experience the slightest pleasure or comfort, it is de­sired. So, in this meditation we should think that all other beings are like our own body: disliking suffering and desiring the experience of pleasure and happiness. There isn’ t  anyone who l i kes to experience suffering. So thinking of the sameness of other beings to our own body, we will develop love for beings, and lose the wish to cause harm  or pain to others, which will lessen our anger.There are two kinds of ignorance: distinct and indis­tinct ignorance. Indistinct ignorance is always there and present with other mental events. It accompanies the arising of all the negativity of mind such as anger, pride, attachment, and so on. Being ignorant, one is not aware of what i s  good and what  i s  harmful .  As  t hes e di f f er ent  mind poi sons a r i s e ,  t hei r  nat ure i s  not underst ood,  and one doesn’ t know if they are good or bad. As a result they are ever-present, but they are not distinct from  ignorance itself. The second kind of ignorance, distinct ignorance, is an isolated ignorance, an ignorance result­ing from  not having received or contemplated the Bud­dhist teachings. Through learning and contemplation,Samatha: Tranquillity Meditation
27

gradually this ignorance can be removed. If one has a great deal of ignorance, the remedy in terms of samatha meditation i s  contemplat ion on t he t wel ve l i nks of de­pendent origination. One contemplates how all things arise and depend on som ething else. For example, by being accustomed to doing good actions and having good thoughts, the power of habit will cause good thoughts and actions to occur. Similarly, w hen the mi nd i s  accust omed t o negat i vi t y and bad t hi ngs,  through the power of that habit negative thoughts and actions occur. So all things are interdependent and contemplation on dependent origination is the remedy for ignorance.The remedy for pride i s  to meditate on the elements that make up a being. W ith pride one thinks of oneself as superior o r special. T h e rem ed y  is to m editate on the five aggregates (Skt. skandhas). By  t hi nki ng of onesel f  a s  special or superior, one sees oneself as solid and definite. If one examines the aggregates, one. discovers that things are not solid, but always changing. O ne is just an aggregation of different elements. For example, a per­son is made up of the five aggregates collected together or just an aggregation of different parts. So, being aware of t he f i v e  aggregat es wi l l  dimi nish one’ s  pri de.The remedy for having too many thoughts i s  to meditate on one’ s  breath. By meditating on the breath, which i s  quite subtle and changing a l l  the time with the in-and-out movements, one’ s thoughts become less and less strong. So this is the rem edy for too m any thoughts.The third cl as s  of object s of meditation i s  the objects o f the learned a n d  i s  t h e  u n d e r s t a n d i n g  of  t h e  f i v e  a g g r e ­gates. For example, one learns that the body is a massThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht
28

of par t s ;  i t  i s  made up of t he f i v e  aggr egat es of f orm,  sensation, identification, mental activity, and conscious­ness. O ne learns that the mind is not just a single indivisible unit, but a composite. There are the eighteen elements that have to do with its organization. For example, the eye originates from the eye of a previous moment .  Then t here i s  t he underst andi ng of t he t we l ve  áyatanas that are involved in organization and develop­ment. For example, one l earns how the eye and vi sual  consciousness connect with some external object and how visual perception occurs through this connection. So the sense organ, the object, and the consciousness must  come t oget her f or  percept i on t o oc cur .  One t hen learns how the twelve steps o f dependence origination work. Finally, one learns the study of the appropriate and the inappropriate, which is a list of things that could and could not happen due to certain causes. So the contemplation of these things is called the contempla­tion of the learned.The fourth cl as s of objects of meditation i s  the purifi­cation o f the klesas. O n e  c o n t e m p l a t e s  t h e  p e a c e f u l  s t a t e  in w hich samatha is present and the opposite state in which samatha i s  absent .  Through vi pasyaná there i s  the understanding o f the causes o f samsára and the causes o f nirvana. All together there are sixteen aspects related to the four noble truths.Four Obstacles to MeditationThere are four kinds of thoughts that cause obstacles to one’ s  meditation. These are malicious thoughts, which are the wish to harm  someone, thoughts of jealousy, thoughts of doubt and uncertainty, and thoughts ofSamatha: Tranquillity Meditation
29

attachment and craving. For example, if thoughts of aggression come up, one needs to recognize them be­cause they will return continuously in one’s meditation. One must r ecogni ze t hat  aggr essi on,  when one becomes attached to it, is causing harm to one’ s meditation. The main thing i s  that one should not be involved in or attached to the thoughts. If one is not attached to the thoughts, it will be easy to get rid o f them. But if one is attached to these thoughts, it w ill be very difficult to get rid of them.There are two different kinds of thoughts: gross and subtle. W hen gross thoughts arise in meditation, one forgets that one is m editating and loses one’s m indful­ness and awareness. Then one remembers, “Oh, I am meditating” and ret urns t o medi t at i ng.  These gr oss thoughts are called an actual distraction. The way to prevent these gross thoughts is to retain mindfulness and awareness. The second kind are subtle thoughts, called thoughts that come from  below. W ith these one does not forget that one is meditating, but remains there thinking, “These little thoughts are occurring.” These thoughts are so small that one cannot usually do very much about  t hem and t hey a r e  ver y di f f i cul t  t o get  r i d of. These thoughts don’t particularly harm  meditation; they just come up in one’s awareness and one just leaves them as they are and eventually one will be able to eliminate them. These little thoughts, however, can sometimes gradually grow larger and larger, and one’ s meditation i s  l os t .  So ,  f i r st  one i s  awar e of t hese l i t t l e thoughts, then one gets distracted by them  and one’ s mindfulness i s  lost. One should try to prevent this from happening by having a very stable and enduring mind­fulness and awareness because this awareness is neces­The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht

sary w ith each successive instant. If one can do that, one will not be distracted.The Specific Stages of MeditationThere are three basic kinds of samatha meditation in relation to the object of meditation. First is meditation with an external object, s e c o n d  i s  meditation without an external object, and third i s  meditation on the essential nature of t h i n g s .You b e g i n  s a m a t h a  m e d i t a t i o n  b y  t r y i n g  t o  m a k e  your mind stable and clear. But you are not accustomed to m editation, so you lose the meditation. Therefore in the beginning you need an object to meditate on. In the same way that a child needs to learn the alphabet before reading a book, so in the beginning you meditate with an object and gradually move on to meditate w ithout an object. The first meditation is on an object: place in front of you a piece of wood or stone that is small and focus your m ind on it. In doing this meditation, you should have the proper tension, that is, the proper amount of focusing. It should not be too tense or too loose. As Saraha says, m editation should be like a Brahmin’ s  thread.  I n t he past  i t  was t he Brahmin cast e’ s  job to make thread. To make the thread properly, one had to have the proper tension. If the tension was too tight, the thread would knot up; if it was too loose, it would easi l y break. T o  devel op mental stability you begin with your attention on an object—first an impure object, and later you introduce a pure object such as a statue of the Buddha or a deity’ s insignia or a special syllable. The purpose of meditation on a pure object is not to develop devotion or compassion; you just restSamatha: Tranquillity Meditation

your mind on it to develop concentration. You should also not think about the faults or the good qualities of the object you are focusing on. You begin w ith a stone or piece of wood because it does not have any features. A Buddha image, however, has many different fea­tures— eyes, ears, and so on— to distract you.The second type of samatha meditation i s  meditation without an external o bje ct. T h e  m i n d  t u r n s  i n w a r d  a n d  focuses on a mental image o f the Buddha in the form  of a yidam  deity such as A valokitesvara (Tib. C henrezi). You e i t h e r  p l a c e  t h e  i ma g e  me n t a l l y  a b o v e  y o u r  h e a d ,  visualize it in front of you, or visualize that your own body i s the deity. Because you are unable to imagine the entire form  at first, you first imagine the deity’s hand, then the eyes, then the clothes, and so on. Imag­ining just the parts is called “partial meditation w ithout an object.” By doing this again and again you eventually become familiar with the visualization and eventually you are able to imagine the entire form of the deity. Next you s e e  a l l  parts of the deity i n a  general way s o you have a general picture of the entire body. This i s  called “having visualization of the complete object.” Some individuals expect to get a  very clear image of the deity in their meditation, and when this does not occur, they become disappointed. The eye or visual faculty has the visual consciousness that “sees” things extrem ely clearly. However, in meditation you use the mental consciousness, which has a general impression of things or a general idea or meaning of things so you don’ t get as clear a perception as w ith visual consciousness. So you shouldn’ t have the expectation of visualizing the deity as clearly as if you were actually looking at a picture of the deity. You should not be concerned withThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht

the clearness o f the im age because the purpose o f m edi­
tation is not to get a clear image, but to focus the mind 
on the image so the mind will become still and stable.
The master Bodhibhadra s a ys  there are two kinds of 
samatha: samatha that is focused externally and samatha 
that is focused internally. The externally focused sama­
tha is the ordinary kind that focuses on a stone or other 
object, and the special kind of samatha is the kind that 
focuses on a statue or image of the Buddha. The inter­
nally focused samatha has two kinds— visualization of 
the body and visualization based on the body. Visuali­
zation of the body is like focusing on something in the 
body such as the breath or the subtle channels or light 
rays w ithin the body or the feeling o f bliss. There are 
many t ypes  of medi t at i on i nst r uct i on gi ve n by t he mas­
ters, but one can classify them  into either m editation 
wi t h ext er nal  o b j e c t s  or  medi t at i on wit hout  ext er nal  
objects.
The third kind of samatha meditation i s  resting in the  
essence.  Af t e r  me d i t a t i n g  o n  a n  e x t e r n a l  o b j e c t ,  t h e n  a n  
internal object, we meditate by just resting in the es­
sence. The m ind is not focused on anything, but rests 
in a com pletely stable and unwavering state. W hen we 
say “ m ind” we think o f it as being just one thing, but 
the Buddha described m ind as being a collection o f six 
or sometimes eight different kinds of consciousness. 
However, the five sense consciousnesses consist of: vi­
sual consciousness, which perceives and experiences 
visual forms; auditory consciousness, which perceives 
sounds based on the ear; olfactory consciousness, which 
perceives smells and is based on the nose; taste con­
sciousness, for taste based on the tongue; and bodilySamatha: Tranquillity Meditation
33

consciousness, which perceives touch and physical sen­sations.These five sense consciousnesses are said to be non- conceptual. They just see, hear, smell, taste, and feel and are not involved with thoughts such as “This is good or bad.” Tilopa, in his instructions to Náropa, said that appearances do no harm, but attachm ent to them causes problems. The actual seeing and hearing of things does not harm  meditation in any way because these consciousnesses are nonconceptual. W hat causes an obstacle to meditation is developing attachm ent to a form, sound, etc. So there is no need to eliminate these sensations in one’ s meditation.In India before the Buddha it was taught that there was just one consciousness. The example for how this one consciousness works is an example of a house with five or six w indow s and a m onkey inside. T he m onkey would sometimes look out one window, then look out another window, so that on the outside it would appear as if there were different m onkeys at different w indow s. But a l l  the time it was just one monkey. The philoso­phers said that the house was like the mind and the windows were l i ke the different sensory conscious­nesses, and there was just one consciousness just as there was just one monkey. But the Buddha said there wasn’ t just one consciousness because if there were, then when one was seeing something, one wouldn’ t be able to hear a sound, or if one heard a sound, one w o u ld n ’t be able to smell, and so on. But in fact, one can see, hear, taste, smell, and feel physical sensations at the same time. So there are five distinct consciousnesses, not just one.When one medi t at es,  one doe s  not u s e  any of t he f i v e  nonconceptual consciousnesses that are used to experi­The Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insig ht

ence a sight, sound, smell, taste, or body sensation. In medi t at i on onl y t wo ment al  cons ci ous nes s es  a r e  i n­volved, and these are the unstable and stable mental consciousnesses. In the unstable consciousness (often called the mental consciousness) all kinds of thoughts arise and at times one feels attraction and happiness, other times dislike and unhappiness, and so on. This i s  our normal consciousness. Then there i s  the stable consciousness that remains completely unaffected by good or bad thoughts, pleasant or unpleasant experi­ences. The clarity of stable consciousness remains the same morning, noon, and night and is also called the ground consciousness, or ¿¡laya c o n s c i o u s n e s s .  Th e r e  i s  a th ird  m ental consciousness called afflicted conscious­ness that has no clarity and is in the state of delusion of always having the thought or feeling of “I.” This thought of ego is always present whether the mind is distracted or not. It is a  very subtle clinging to the self and one has it all the time whether one is aware of it or not, even when one is sleeping. Whatever one is doing, this subtle ego-clinging is always present, this thought of a  “me.” If one hear s a  sound, t here i s  t he subt l e reaction, “Oh, this is dangerous to m e.” So, it is present all the tim e and until the attainm ent o f the state o f an arhat or of Buddhahood, all beings have this subtle ego- clinging. It is therefore called the lasting consciousness because the five sensory consciousnesses change contin­ually. In all there are five sensory consciousnesses and three mental consciousnesses to make a total of eight.One medi t at es  wi t h t he  s i xt h c o n s c i o u s n e s s ,  c a l l e d  the mental consciousness because this consciousness deals w ith concepts. It is involved with the past, present, and future; good and bad; all the different klesas; and soSamatha: Tranquillity Meditation
35

on. The root of all these is mental consciousness, so this sixth consciousness is the root of all thoughts and concepts. In meditation one controls this consciousness that experiences all thoughts, delusions, and feelings. In meditation one cont rol s i t  s o  t hat  i t  s t a y s  s t i l l  and t hese types o f thoughts do not arise. This m ental conscious­ness has two aspects: knowledge of other and knowledge of onesel f. The knowledge of other occurs when the mi nd t ur ns out ward and t hi nks ,  “Oh,  t hi s  i s  good or  this is bad. I need this or I don’t need this.” Externally oriented knowledge is conceptual. The knowledge of oneself is very direct knowledge of what one is thinking. This self-awareness i s  nonconceptual; without this self- awareness, one wouldn’t know what one is thinking about. It is a mindfulness that gives us clear knowledge of whether one i s  meditating or not.  So i n meditation there is this mindfulness and awareness.When one  i s  medi t at i ng,  t he  mi nd or  t he  ge ne r a l  mental consci ousness i s  bei ng absorbed into the ground consciousness. For example, if one thinks of waves as thoughts and ground consciousness as the ocean, then the waves originate from  the ocean and then m erge or disappear into the ocean. In the same way, thoughts arise from  the unceasing, unim paired clarity o f ground consciousness and then merge and disappear into ground consciousness. Also, when it i s  windy, the waves in the ocean increase; when it is calm, the waves subside and the ocean becomes stable and calm. In the same way, thoughts appear in the mind that are like a wind coming from t he ground consci ousness.  This causes all the movement o f thoughts in the mind. So if this w ind from  the ground consciousness subsides and merges into i t sel f,  the thoughts subside and the mindThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
36

becomes still. This is described by Milarepa in one of his songs in which he talks about the manifestations o f the m ind in the same way that the waves are a manifes­tation o f the sea. These waves come to rest in the sea just as thoughts come to rest in the mind. So thoughts are just the play or manifestation of the mind. There­fore, thoughts arise from  the m ind because they come from the mind. So when the wind arising from the ground consciousness i s  stilled, the mind becomes stil l.So the ultimate form  of samatha is having thoughts disappear into the ground consciousness with the mind becoming stable and very relaxed. In other words, one has a great num ber of thoughts coming out of this ground consciousness and in meditation there i s  in­creased effort to absorb these thoughts back into the unceasing and unchanging clarity of ground conscious­ness. In such a way one will have a relaxed and still mind.The sixth consciousness has to relax into the ground consciousness because it arises out of the ground con­sciousness and therefore m ust return to it. In meditation one needs the sixth consciousness to become still and calm w ithout any thoughts arising. The ground con­sciousness in itself does not create an obstacle to medi­tation. But the seventh, or afflicted, consciousness is characterized by ego-clinging. It is always there. It does not create an obstacle to meditation but it does create an obstacle to liberation. Nevertheless, as one gradually becomes more accustomed to the realization of selfless­ness, this afflicted consciousness, this subtle ego-cling­ing gradually disappears. If the sixth mental conscious­ness becomes involved in the five sense consciousnesses, then it becomes an obstacle to meditation. But if theSamatha: Tranquillity Meditation
37

mind r es t s  cal ml y and st abl y i n i tself and does not become involved in sense perceptions, then the sense perceptions do not create an obstacle to meditation. However, since the ordinary mind is habituated to in­volvement with sense perceptions, it is better for the beginner to practice in a quiet, isolated place.The Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insight

3Identifying Experiences i n  Samatha Medi t a t i onIn the Treasury o f Knowledge t h e  p r a c t i c e  of me di t a ­tion is described in terms o f the textual tradition and also in terms o f the oral instructions o f the great medi t at ors.  The t ext s ar e important because t hey de­scribe and explain the meaning of the teachings of the Buddha, and the instructions are important because they come from the actual experience of meditating. First, let us begin w ith the textual tradition that describes medi t at i on i n t er ms of t he f i v e  t hi ngs t hat  c a n  c a u s e  medi t at i on t o go wrong and t he ei ght  ways  t o el i mi nat e these faults.The Five FaultsWhen me di t a t i ng,  on e  h a s  t o  r e c o g ni z e  whi ch e xpe r i ­ences come out of meditation and which faults have to be eliminated. There are five faults that have to be eliminated through eight kinds of actions or antidotes. These five faults or defects prevent the development of medi t at i on and a r e  des cr i bed by Asanga i n t he t eachi ngs  of Maitreya i n the Differentiation of the Middle Way from the Extremes. Th i s  t e x t  s a y s  t h a t  i f  t h e  mi n d  c a n  r e s t  o n  an object, then the m ind becomes workable and very stable so we can do whatever we wish with the mind. In39

contrast, our normal mind is like riding a wild horse; when we ar e on a  wild horse we cannot s t a y in one spot and we cannot go where we want to go. But if the mind becomes tame and workable, we can do whatever we want. We can use our mind to increase our wisdom and understanding, or if we need miraculous powers and clairvoyance, we can develop these. The way to obtain a workable mind i s  through eliminating the f i ve faults to meditation.The first faul t i s  laziness. L a z i n e s s  p r e v e n t s  t h e  a p p l i ­cation of meditation because one doesn’ t even begin after receiving instructions in meditation. There are actually three kinds of laziness. First is lethargy, in which one isn’ t  interested in doing anything except sleeping. Second is attachment to worldly activity re­sulting in no desire for dharma practice or meditation. Instead one devotes oneself to worldly activities such as hunting animals, lying and deceiving others, and so on. These are activities one enjoys, one i s  used to, or thinks about a lot. In one sense one has diligence, but it is an obstacle to practicing the dharma. This is also called attachment to negative activity. The third is despon­dency and self-accusation, which result in thinking, “Others can meditate, but I  can’ t ;  others will under­stand the dharma, but I won’t.” The fact is that all beings are able to meditate and work on the path, but if they underestimate their capabilities, this is also called self-repudiation.The second fault i s  forgetting the instructions, w h i c h  i s  a lack o f  m indfulness on  how  to m editate properly. While meditating, one should be very cl ear  about what one is doing, what faults must be eliminated, and whatThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht
40

remedies m ust be applied. So one needs to rem em ber the instructions for meditation.The third fault i s  the obstacle o f stupor and agitation. These are classified a s  a  single fault. In stupor the mind is cloudy and dull. In its obvious fo rm  there is a loss o f  clarity of mind. In its subtle form  there is some clarity, but it i s  very weak. There are also two kinds of agita­tion. There is an obvious kind in which one keeps thinking about what one has done or what fun one has had, so one is unable to rest the mind upon anything. In its subtle form  one has apparent stability o f mind, but there are still subtle thoughts that keep coming up. So there are two kinds o f stupor and two kinds of agitation that cause an obstacle during meditation by causing the mind to lose its clarity and stability.The fourth fault i s  underapplication, w h i c h  o c c u r s  when dul l ness  or agi t at i on appear  i n one’ s  medi t at i on and one recognizes these thoughts, but doesn’ t apply a remedy. If one does not apply the remedy, meditation will not develop.The fifth faul t  i s  overapplication. For  exampl e,  dul l ness or agitation may appear in one’ s  meditation, the remedy is applied, and the dullness or agitation is elim inated. ’Vet o n e  c o n t i n u e s  t o  a p p l y  t h e  r e m e d y  e v e n  t h o u g h  i t  i s  no longer useful. This is the fault of overapplication. The remedies should be used only when agitation and dullness appear; when they are eliminated, one should just rest in equanimity.Although dul l nes s  and agi t at i on h a v e  t hei r  i ndi vi dual  characteristics, their effects as an obstacle to meditation are the same so they can be counted as just one fault. This system yields fi ve faults, whereas if one countsIdentifying Experiences in Samatha
4i

these as separate, one gets six faults, which is the system  used in the Stages o f Meditation by Kamalasila.The Eight AntidotesTo develop one’s m editation, one has to elim inate the five faults. First one m ust be able to recognize w hat these faults are, then one needs to apply the remedies that eliminate them. These remedies are called the eight remedies that eliminate the five faults.As described before, there are eight consciousnesses and these eight are called the principal mind. Within these consciousnesses occur transform ations or changes. These changes are called mental events that can be sometimes good and sometimes bad. These mental events can also be described in term s o f the five aggre­gates. There are the aggregates of form, sensation, identification, m ental events, and consciousness. These describe the changes that occur within the principal mind. In the anal ysi s of the aggregate of mental event s ,  there are fifty-one different kinds of mental events such as laziness, fo rg ettin g  instructions, and so on. T hese five faults are m ental events, and the eight antidotes are also am ong this list o f fifty-one mental events.The first fault mentioned was l azi ness,  a  particularly powerful obstacle to meditation. There are four mental events that rem edy this laziness. The first o f these remedies is having aspiration or interest in meditation, meaning that one l i kes t o meditate and i s  happy medi­tating. O ne could say that one is attached to meditation, but this attachment i s  positive, so we use the word aspiration because the attachment i s  to something that i s  negative and harmful. In Tibetan there are two wordsThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
42

for “attachm ent”— chagpa,  which i s  negat i ve attachment 
usually translated as “attachment,” and mopa,  wh i c h  i s  
positive attachment usually translated as “aspiration.” If 
someone likes stealing, then they are attached to stealing 
and this is chagpa —n e g a t i v e  a t t a c h me n t .  I f  s ome one  
wants to help someone el se or wants to practice the 
dharma and they are attached to that, then this is mopa  
because it is beneficial to oneself and others. The mean­
ing o f these words appears to be the same in that one is 
thinking, “I have to do this” but with mopa  one  want s  
to help and with chagpa  o n e  wa n t s  t o  ha r m.  The  wor d 
chagpa  a l s o  h a s  t h e  me a n i n g  of  “ b e i n g  s t u c k ”  s o  t h a t  
one stays where one is and can’ t go any higher. So this 
word means a  block to one’ s  development.  If t hi s attach­
ment  wer e somet hi ng pos i t i ve l i k e  medi t at i on,  t hen i t  
would bring a  posi ti ve resul t.  If one l i kes meditating, 
then one will meditate, which will naturally eliminate 
the laziness as an obstacle. Sometimes, however, attach­
ment  i s  not  pos i t i ve  and wi l l  not  br i ng a ny be n e f i t .  For  
example, I received a letter from South Africa in which 
the person said that she liked her cat very m uch and 
then she lost her cat. It was a very beautiful cat, but the 
person was always thinking about the cat and couldn’ t 
forget it. This is an example of attachment that is not 
beneficial. W hat one needs is attachment to something 
that is beneficial, which we can call “aspiration.”
The second remedy i s  zeal .  If one has interest and 
moti vati on t o pr act i ce,  t hen one doesn’ t  h a v e  t o f or ce 
oneself to practice meditation; there will be a  natural 
zeal to practice.
The third remedy for l azi ness i s  fai t h.  Although thi s 
is sim ilar to the first rem edy, aspiration m eans that oneIdentifying Experiences in Samatha
43

has som ething to aspire to, while faith means a belief in something very valuable.The fourth remedy i s  literally called “well trained” and is also translated as “flexible” or “supple.” This means that one’ s  mind i s  ready at any moment to meditate. One doesn’ t have to think, “Oh, now I’ m going to have to meditate—how difficult, what a  strain meditation is.” Without t hi s suppl eness of the “wel l -  trained” m ind and body, one does not have true sama- tha, but just a one-pointed state o f m ind. We can force our mind to be one-pointed with effort, but when we have the suppleness o f m editation, the m ind naturally rests one-pointedly w ithout effort. This rem edy and the previous three will eliminate the defect of laziness.The fifth remedy i s  mindfulness, which remedies forgetting the instructions of meditation. O ne has a meditative state in which one doesn’ t forget the instruc­tions. M indfulness has three characteristics. First, one has a sharpness and clearness of m ind in which the instructions are not forgotten. Second, although the mind i s  ver y sharp and f ocused,  t her e a r e  not many thoughts arising because meditation is nonconceptual, so there are not m any thoughts arising and the m ind is naturally focused one-pointedly on an object. Third, because one has trust and faith and has the suppleness or flexibility of having become well trained, meditation becomes pleasant with a sense of comfort and pleasure. These three qualities in one’ s  meditation cause the medi­tation instructions not to be forgotten.The third faul t i s  stupor or agitation. Fi rst , one must recognize that agitation or stupor is appearing while meditating. When one f i nds either of these present, then one should apply a remedy to it. There are three meth­The Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insight
44

ods to eliminate stupor or agitation. First, when one experiences stupor, one can visualize in one’ s heart a four-petaled white lotus with a white sphere in its center. Then imagine this going up to the crown of the head to the level of the hair and then to a distance of four fmger-widths above the head. W hen there is agita­tion or too m any thoughts, visualize an upside-down four-petaled black lotus in the heart with a little black sphere in its center. Imagine it going down to the level of one’ s  s e a t  and f our fmger-wi dt hs bel ow t hat  i nt o t he ground. A second remedy for stupor is to keep one’ s  eyes wide open and look upward and tense one’ s body. Fo^ rem oving agitation one looks dow nw ard w ith eyes half closed, and relaxes the body. The third remedy for dullness is to be in a bright place. One opens all the windows and makes the room bright and cool  and al so wears light clothing. For agitation the room should be warm and darkened and one shoul d wear  t hi ck cl ot hi ng.The fourth faul t i s  inactivity in which one experiences dullness or agitation in one’ s meditation but does noth­ing about it. W hen this happens, one will fall under its power and obviously not be able to work toward en­lightenm ent. W hen one recognizes that there is dullness or agitation during meditation, one should remember and apply the remedies with diligence. So perform­ing the proper remedy will eliminate the defect o f inactivity.The fifth faul t  i s  the defect of overact i vi t y^ which means that when one i s  meditating with none of the f i ve faults, one shouldn’t do anything but rest in that m edi­tative state. D oing this will eliminate the defect of overactivity.Identifying Experiences in Samatha

In sum m ary, there are eight m ental remedies that can eliminate the five faults.The Six Powers, Nine Levels, and Four EngagementsIn the Treasury o f Knowledge t w o  d i f f e r e n t  k i n d s  o f  teachings are given from  two different traditions. The first is the samatha instruction in the textual tradition, which comes from the great scholars and siddhas of the past who composed texts on the instructions for medi­tation in words that are easy to understand. The second kind is the samatha instructions from the practice tradi­tion, which comes from  siddhas describing the experi­ence that comes from  m editation and how one elimi­nates the faults and develops the good qualities of meditation. What fol l ows i s  meditation from the textual tradition.There are six powers that eliminate defects in samatha meditation and bring about mental st abi l i t y.  The s i x powers bring about nine levels of mental stability. These nine levels of mental stability are created by six powers and four kinds of mental engagements.The first of the six powers i s  the strength of the power of l i s t e n i n g , o r  h e a r i n g ,  o r  r e c e i v i n g  t h e  t e a c h i n g s .  Th i s  develops the first stage of mental stability or samatha, which' is called the settling or resting of the mind. Normally one’ s  mind i s  distracted by thoughts, s o one has to settle the m ind a little in order not to be too distracted by external things. This is done through the power of listening. One hears the teachings of the Buddha, the teachings in the commentaries, and the explanations given by the scholars and siddhas. Through t hese one underst ands what meditation i s  l i ke .The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
46

Hearing these, one i s  able to understand settling the 
mi nd and l e ar ns  how t o medi t at e.  Mar pa s a i d  t hat  
hearing and contemplating the teachings is like a  torch 
that illuminates the darkness because if one has this 
source of light, one can see where one is going, what is 
there, and w hat m ight be dangerous and harmful. In 
Tibet, there i s  also a  saying, “If one does not have a  
lamp and walks in the dark, then one’s head m ight 
connect with a pillar.” In the same way hearing and 
contemplating the teachings is like a lamp— it dispels 
the darkness and one sees w hat it is one m ust do and 
how one has to do it.
The second power i s  the power of contemplation  o r  
reflection, which means that one goes through the rea­
son and the logic of the teachings to complete the 
continuity of teachings. With this power one develops 
the second stage o f m ental stability, w hich is called 
continued settlement. In the first stage one can rest the 
mi nd br i e f l y ,  s a y  f or  f i v e  mi nut es,  and i n t he s econd 
stage one can do it longer, say for ten minutes.7  These 
first two stages o f listening to the teachings and contin­
ually contemplating them are the first two powers and 
accomplish the first mental engagement, which is called 
disciplined or controlled engagement. This first engage­
ment  i nvol ve s  t he power s  of hear i ng t he t eachi ngs  and 
contemplating them. In this first mental engagement 
the m ind is controlled and focused w ith discipline.
The third power i s  the power of mindfulness.  T h i s  i s  
similar to the remedy for not forgetting one’ s medita­
tion instructions discussed above. This power o f m ind­
fulness develops the third level o f mental stability called 
the reestablished settlement. This means that w hen one

aware that one has become distracted by them. O ne returns to the state of meditation, so one reapplies oneself to it, reestablishing this settling in meditation. When t he r e  i s  a  di s t r a c t i on t ha t  t a k e s  one  a w a y  f r om resting in meditation, one is able to return to one’ s state of meditation r epeat edl y.  Thi s i s  reappl yi ng a  st at e of settling the mind. This power comes from the power of mindfulness because one becomes aware of the mind being distracted by some thought. With mindfulness one thinks, “I’ m not going to be fully under the influ­ence o f this distracting thought” and m entally returns to w hat one is doing. This power o f mindfulness also develops the fourth stage o f mental stability, called intensified settlement, in which the m ind that has been broadly focused is now focused very narrowly. The mind, for exampl e,  i s  narrowly focused on an obj ect .  The purpose of this kind of meditation i s  to focus the mi nd on something ver y s ubt l e.What  c a n  we  do t o  p r e ve nt  t h i s  cont i nuous  a r i s i ng  of thoughts? The text says that the m ind is very vast and thoughts continuously arise and go everywhere. The mi nd ha s  t o be dr awn i nward and made more narr ow,  more const r i ct ed.  S o  t hi s  i s  t he s t at e c a l l e d  t he concen­trated or intensified settlement, which is the fourth stage of samat ha medi t at i on.  The power  necessar y for t hi s  i s  the third power o f mindfulness and m em ory. We need to rem em ber teachings given by the Buddha, the com ­mentaries, and the actual meditation instructions. We  also need to be m indful o f distractions so that w hen we become distracted we know this state allows us not to become attached or involved with that thought, so we can leave it and return to resting in meditation. Some­times w hen we are m editating and a thought arises, weThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht

think, “This is an im portant thought. This one I really have to think about!” Since we spend such a short time in m editation, we should tell ourselves that we can think about the thought all the rest of the day when the meditation sessi on i s  o v e r .Sântideva gives an example of why it is necessary to have mindfulness. He says that thoughts and klesas are like robbers or thieves because a thief will look at the person to see whether that person is strong or powerful. If he thinks he is not strong, he will rob him. If a thief believes som eone is strong and has weapons and lots o f reinforcement, the thief will not steal from  him. In the same way, if a m editator has mindfulness and awareness, then he w on’t lose his m editation or practice o f good actions. But, if someone does not have mindfulness and awareness, then thoughts and klesas will arrive and steal away the m editation and destroy the practice o f good actions. The remedy that prevents the attack of mind poisons and thoughts is having mindfulness and awareness.The mind i s  like a  door. Whatever comes i n,  whether it be a thief or a great deal o f wealth, m ust com e through that door. Similarly, if any negative or positive qualities come in, they come in through the mind. Likewise, if one goes into a bank, for example, there is normally a guard at the door with a  gun to prevent thieves from entering. In the same way, thé mind is like a door and one needs mindfulness as a guard present all the time. Just as a guard is not enough, one needs the weapon of awareness. If mindfulness and awareness are there all the time, then the thoughts and klesas w on’t be able to come in and steal what is positive. To carry the example further, Indian banks put a guard with a gun to guardIdentifying Experiences in Samatha
49

the door. But since they are afraid that there is nothing to keep the guard from  robbing the bank, their solution is to chain the guard to a pillar outside. So Indian banks have a guard w ith a rifle chained to a pillar to stop thieves from  com ing in and the guard from  robbing the bank. In the same way, to protect one’ s  meditation one needs to have mindfulness guarding the door of the mi nd and i n  or der  t o pr event  t he mi ndf ul ness from losing control, one chains it there w ith awareness.The fourth power i s  the power o f awareness, w h i c h  means one knows exactly what i s  occurring and what one is doing. Normally, one isn’ t aware of what is happening, but this power of awareness develops two levels o f m ental stability, nam ely, the fifth level called tam ing and the sixth level called pacification. Norm ally, our mind cannot be motivated to meditate and so it i s  very difficult to meditate. With the power of taming, however, we become aware of the qualities and benefits of meditating: that i t  benef i t s our sel ves and ot hers;  that this m editation can help us develop clairvoyance and miraculous powers and increase our understanding and wisdom. Being awar e of a l l  t he qual i t i es that resul t from medi t at i on wi l l  c aus e us  t o be at t ract ed t o medi t at i on and encourage us to meditate so our mind becomes tamed. Thus this power o f awareness that develops the level o f tam ing leads to the sixth level o f m ental stability called pacification. After samatha m editation what is im portant in the postmeditation state is mindfulness and awareness. W ith mindfulness we don’ t forget the condition of our mind and with awareness we are very clear about w hat is happening all the time. To those who want  t o cont rol  t hei r  mi nd,  Sant i deva s a i d ,  “I  a s k with hands c l as ped t oget her t o make mi ndf ul ness andThe Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insight

awareness very im portant.” D uring meditation sessions, mindfulness and awareness are al so important, and aft er meditation s es s i ons  one shoul d mai nt ai n mi ndful ness and awareness as much as possible.In T ibetan drenpa m e a n s  “mi n d f u l n e s s , ”  a n d  sheshin means “awareness.” Drenpa a l s o  m e a n s  “ m i n d f u l n e s s  and m em ory.” It means that one is mindful of what one is doing and rem em bers w h at one has to do w hether one is meditating, whether one has lost the power of concentration, and so on. Mindfulness is like a causal condition and awareness is like the result. If one has very concentrated mindfulness, one immediately notices a th o u g h t arising and this becom es aw areness, w h ich  becomes sheshin, and one knows what is occurring. Normally, one does not know what i s  i n one’ s  mind or what  one i s  t hi nki ng,  s o  t her e i s  no a wa r e n e s s .  But  if one has mindfulness, then it is said to the extent that mindfulness brings mental st abilit y, one has awar eness.  So when one has mindfulness, it is through one’ s aware­ness of what is happening.At this level of pacification we become aware of the negative qualities of distraction. Santideva explains this by saying that when the mind i s distracted, it is between the fangs o f the w ild animal of the klesas, and from  mental distract ions come a l l  the di f f i cul t i es and mental hardships of this and future lives. Being in a state of distraction will increase the negative qualities of the mi nd more and mor e.  Howe ve r ,  bei ng a wa r e  of t he negative qualities motivates us to meditate.The fifth power i s  the power of diligence. T h i s  p o w e r  creates the seventh level of mental stability, which is complete pacification. In the previous level of pacifica­tion one contemplates the qualities o f m editation andIdentifying Experiences in Samatha

the faults o f distraction and eliminates these. Som e­times, however, w ith very strong obstacles such as unhappiness, regret, or aggression, just thinking of the good qualities of meditation will not eliminate them right away. Instead, one needs the power of diligence so that one can eliminate all strong obstacles such as attach­ment, aggression, and ignorance and can creat e the seventh level of meditative stability of complete pacification.The power of diligence also creates the eighth l evel  of mental st abi l i t y,  which i s  cal l ed one-pointedness be­cause all powerful distractions of mind have been elimi­nated and the mind can rest one-pointedly. At the level of one-poi nt edness one can medi t at e without much effort, and this power o f diligence is used to maintain this one-pointed state.The first mental engagement i s  called the tightly controlled engagement and is associated with the first two levels o f mental stability. The second mental en­gagement, called interrupted engagement, is associated with t he t hi rd through s event h l e v e l s  of st abi l i t y.  Inter­rupted engagement means that one rests the m ind in a state of stability; then it is interrupted by some defect and one then applies the remedy. One continues this repeatedly so that one’ s  stability is continually inter­rupted. At the level o f the eighth mental stability of one- pointedness one develops the third mental engagement called the uninterrupted mental engagement. At this point the mind focuses on one point and remains there wi t hout  i nt er rupt i on.The sixth power i s  the power of familiarization. At  t h i s  level the m ind is naturally settled w ith o u t the need for effort or discipline. The fourth mental engagement as­The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

sociated with this power is the naturally present mental engagement. The ninth level of mental stability is called resting in equanimity. So at the ninth level of mental stability w ith the sixth power and the fourth mental engagement, the mind just rests in equanimity, relaxed wi t hout  e f f or t .  Thi s  i s  t he  f i n a l  s t a ge  of ment al  s t a bi l i t y.The f i ve defect s and eight remedies are taught in the Differentiation of the Middle Way from the Extremes, which is b y  A sanga and is one o f the five w orks o f M aitreya. The Buddha’ s  teachings are divided into the sutras, the vinaya, and the abhidharma. The Differentiation of the Middle Way from the Extremes i s  a  c o mme n t a r y  o n  t h e  abhidharma. The nine levels of mental stability are taught in M aitreya’ s Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras by Asanga. This text explains and clarifies the teachings of the sutras. The six powers and four m ental engagem ents are found in one of the five treatises of Asanga called the Levels o f the Srdvakas.To sum m arize, w hen we m editate, faults arise that prevent us from developing our meditation (see table i).When t he bodhi s at t vas  medi t at ed,  t hey s a w t he  f a u l t s  that arose and then identified them  and were able to find remedies that could eliminate these faults. But if we don’ t recognize these faul ts when meditating, we will not progress toward Buddhahood. Through the teach­ings we can identify these defects and know  how to apply the correct remedy. This particular teaching is one that should be experienced directly, not just studied intellectually. As the five defects arise in our m editation, we should apply the eight remedies and use the six powers and the four mental engagements in our medi­tation. Also, through our m editation we should be able to identify w hich level o f m ental stability we haveIdentifying Experiences in Samatha

reached. Therefore, these m editation instructions are very im portant and we need to understand them thor­oughly.The Tradition of Oral InstructionThe instruction of samatha has been passed on orally from one individual to another. One first receives in­struction on samatha much like the instruction in this book. This first stage is called the experience o f instability. When one  be gi ns  t o me di t a t e ,  one  f i r s t  e x p e r i e n c e s  t he  mi nd a s  ve r y unst abl e wi t h many,  many t hought s a r i s ­ing. There are good thoughts and bad thoughts and this is likened to a w aterfall ru sh in g  o ff a cliff. W hen the water hits the bottom, i t  splashes up with a  great deal  of agitation and makes many wave s .  In meditation i t  seems one has never had so m any thoughts and one thinks, “ I am  getting worse because o f m y m editation.” But, in fact, one i s  not developing more thoughts; rather, before one had begun to meditate, one didn’ t think about how m any thoughts one had. O ne didn’t analyze them  and so one wasn’ t aware of the num ber of thoughts. Actually, m editation is the beginning of deal­ing w ith one’s m ind because one becomes aware of one’ s  thoughts.When we  be gi n t o me di t a t e  c o n t i n u a l l y ,  we  be gi n t o  have a second experience called the experience o f attain­ment. Wi t h t h i s  e x p e r i e n c e  w e  b e g i n  t o  f e e l  t h a t  we  h a v e  accomplished good meditation. This experience is lik­ened to a m ountain stream or a river in a gully. The river is still rough w ith m any waves, but it isn’t as powerful and fierce as a waterfall.The next l e v e l  of meditation becomes easi er and i sIdentifying Experiences in Samatha

likened to a slow-flowing river. The m editation is easier but not to the extent that it is a  continuous state of meditative stability with no thoughts arising. But it i s  not as rough and unconnected as the second stage of attainment. So now there is a kind of smoothness and gentleness because the power of thoughts has decreased. This third level i s called the experience o f familiarization.The fourth l evel  i s known a s  the experience o f stability because there is a continuous state of stability without a flow o f disturbing thoughts. At this stage one has reached the degree o f stability in which one has control over one’ s mind. This is compared to an ocean that is calm and without waves.The fifth l e v e l  i s  cal l ed the experience o f complete stabil­ity a n d  i s  t h e  f i n a l  s t a g e  i n  wh i c h  o n e  i s  not  d i s t u r b e d  by any kind of experience. The experiences that arise in this fifth level are bliss, clarity, and the absence o f thoughts. For example, while meditating one m ight experience a great sensation of bliss and later this bliss disappears. O r one day suddenly a great clarity arises in one’ s  meditation and one might think, “What i s  this clarity I’ m experiencing?” O r one m ight experience a state devoid of conceptual thoughts. These are the three kinds of experiences that can arise in samatha medita­tion. At this level whatever arises does not affect one’s mental st abi l i t y and one i s  unaffect ed by conditions such as those that create craving or anger or even love and compassion. As a result one develops great clarity and brightness of mind that is devoid of dullness or stupidity. The example for this experience is a candle flame burning in still air; it is very bright and gives good light, but if it is in m oving air, it just gives interm ittent light. O nce the m ind is stable and becomes unaffectedThe Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insig ht

by thoughts, then one is able to have a clear understand­ing o f things. There are two aspects o f this perfect understanding: the aspect of clarity and the aspect of purity. Clarity is when everything is seen with sharp vision, everything is understood very clearly, vividly, and in detail. The aspect of purity is when the mind is not stained by uncertainty and there is no fluctuation in this clarity. It is com pletely pure and unpolluted under­standing.Normally, when we devel op some mental st abi l i t y and have a good meditative experience, we think, “This is w onderful, I m u st be becom ing a sid d h a.” W hen we have a bad meditative experience, on the other hand, we think, “This is terrible, I’m  obviously doing everything wr ong. ”  Bu t  wh a t e v e r  e x p e r i e n c e  o c c u r s —g o o d  o r  bad— we should just continue meditating. If a good experience arises, we should not feel we are better than everyone else and feel proud; we should just continue meditating. If a  bad experi ence a r i s es ,  we should not become depressed because that will just cause us to fall into a lower existence; we should just proceed w ith our medi t at i on and mai nt ai n t he pr act i ce cont i nual l y.  When Gampopa had t he exper i ence of havi ng t he Hevaj r a mandal a appear before him or s aw the whole Chakra- samvara mandala or met his yidam deity in his medita­tion, he w ould go to his teacher M ilarepa and ask him  what i t  meant .  Mi l ar epa woul d a l wa y s  s a y  i t  wa s  noth­ing at all and that there was nothing good or bad in it and that he should go back and carry on meditating. Sometimes Gampopa would have very bad experiences while meditating. One time the whole world began to spin until he threw up; another time everything went completely dark so that Gampopa had to feel his wayIdentifying Experiences in Samatha

around on his hands and knees and thought this must have been caused by a demon. Still another time he heard a loud shouting from nowhere and thought that he had gone insane. W hen he went and asked Milarepa about it, Milarepa just said it was nothing at all, not good or bad, and told him to just carry on meditating. Likewise, we should just carry on with our meditation whether we ha ve  good or bad experiences.The Accomplishment of SamathaSo far the nature of m editation in the scholastic and oral traditions has been discussed. Now let us discuss the result o f m editation or the signs of accom plishm ent in meditation. The result of meditation i s  the experience of b l i s s  of mind and body.  Thi s b l i s s  of mind and body is called literally “ well train ed .” In T ibetan it is shinjang, which i s  act ual l y a  description of the cause of the resul t ;  the nam e o f the cause, “being well trained,” is used for the actual result. So actually being well trained is the cause, but the nam e is given to the result. Shintu means “a  great deal” or “very much” and jangpa m e a n s  “trained” or t he mastery of something. So  shintu jangpa means that “one i s  well trained in something.” The text says that if one has not attained this state o f being well trained in body and mind, then one has not really reached the full attainm ent o f samatha meditation. Even if one has attained the highest (the fourth) mental en­gagement and the final (ninth) stage of mental stability, if one doesn’ t have the well-trained body and mind, one hasn’ t achieved full samatha meditation. This is ex­plained in the Definite Explanation of the View. I n  t h i s  sutra M aitreya asks w hat the m editation of a bodhisattvaThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht
58

is like w h e n  he o r she has developed all the m ental engagements, but still doesn’t have a well-trained body and mind. M aitreya also asks if one has achieved sama­tha m editation w hen one hasn’t developed this well- trained body and mind. The Buddha answered, “N o .” So to have valid sam atha m editation one m ust be well trained so that the m ind and body are completely w ork­able and one has the one-pointed level of mental stability of t he desi r e real m.A description of this state i s  given by Asanga in his Compendium of the Abhidharma. He  s t a t e d  t ha t  o n e  n e e d s  to attain this well-trained m ind and body that cuts through the continuum  of the factors that lead to nega­tive states. If one can remove these negative propensities, then the m ind becomes workable and usable. W ith meditation and t hi s  workabi l i t y of mind one can el i mi ­nate all the obscurations of the klesas. Asanga then goes on to describe these negative propensities of body and mind.  The negat i ve propensi ty of t he body i s  t o resi st  involvement in good actions and m editation so that a great deal of effort is needed to do these things. The negative propensity of the mind makes meditation dif­ficult so that the m ind cannot rest naturally or easily in medi t at i on.  Negat i ve pr opensi t i es of t he body r esul t  i n a slight resistance to d oing positive actions, and one feels physically very heavy and uncom fortable w hen medi t at i ng.  Fi r s t ,  one devel ops  ment al  suppl eness i n which the mind becomes st abl e,  pl easant ,  and r el axed.  Then one develops physical suppleness because when the m ind becomes very comfortable and still, then the life air (Skt. prana) b e c o m e s  u n o b s t r u c t e d  a n d  u n d i s ­turbed so it permeates the body. W ith this flow of life air the body feels very light and comfortable and theIdentifying Experiences in Samatha
59

negative propensities of the body are eliminated. This feeling is not just mental, but is an actual physical sensation.How do these physical and mental sensations of sa- matha occur ? This question i s  answered i n Asanga’ s  Levels of the Sravakas. F i r s t ,  one  e x pe r i e nc e s  a  ve r y s ubt l e  sensation and one doesn’ t know if it is in the body or mind. One just f eel s  a  very subtle,  pleasant sensation. Later on it becomes stronger and more obvious and one knows it is a definite pleasurable sensation. Still later on it becomes very strong and one experiences bliss and comfort. One becomes very confident of one’ s  medita­tion at this point, but one should not becom e attached to or proud o f this sensation and think that it is special. Instead, one should remain in a state o f equanim ity and think, “This sensation can come or go, but it doesn’t mat t er . ”  I f  o n e  c a n  r e s t  a t  t h i s  t i me  i n  e q u a n i mi t y ,  t h e n  one can achieve a very deep state of peace. This bliss is said to be like a shadow because w hen a shadow appears it is definitely there; but it has no substance. In the same way when this experience of bliss is present, it is defi­nitely there, but it has no substance. One shouldn’ t cling to this sensation of pleasure or one will fall under its power.When one  h a s  f ul l y at t a i ned a  wel l - t r a i ne d mi nd a nd body, then there is no external or internal distraction or disturbance and the mind i s  completely stable. At this level all the obvious klesas are elim inated and pacified. If one has fully developed a well-trained body and mind, then one’ s m editation will be an experience o f bliss. If this well-trained state is strong, one experiences these sensations before, during, and after m editation as well. The power of this well-trained state creates a  greatThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht

clarity of perception so that one sees everything down to the smallest detail— dow n to the smallest particles. In fact, there are three particular qualities o f a well-trained mind and body—t he sensat i on of b l i s s ,  gr eat  cl ar i t y of perception, and the disappearance of the sensation of the ten characteristics. The ten characteristics are the sensory sensations o f vision, sound, smell, taste, and bodily sensation; the time perception of past, present, and future; and the gender perception of masculine and feminine. W hen resting in meditation, it is as if one has blended with space and there is no conception of these ten qualities, as if everything has disappeared. Then after the meditation session, it is as if the body suddenly reappears.The Purpose of Accomplishing SamathaIn the sutras and the tantras it is said that sam atha is the basis for all meditation. All meditative states, including vipasyana, come from and depend on the development of samat ha.  For  exampl e,  if one want s t o grow pl ant s,  one must have good soil, and if one has good soil one doesn’ t need to put a lot of effort into gardening because the plants will grow  quickly and easily in good soil. However, with poor soil, no matter how much effort one puts into gardening, one cannot grow good plants. In the same way, if one has good samatha, then one can easily develop clairvoyant and miraculous powers, vipa­syana, and wisdom. Good samatha meditation will also diminish all the negativities of the mind by creating a state o f peace. Then no m atter what physical pain, hardships, or mental obstacles and confusion occur, theIdentifying Experiences in Samatha
61

suffering does not harm  one because all these things are suppressed and diminished by mental stability.Kamalaslla in the first book of his Stages o f Meditation says that if one is able to rest in a state o f equanim ity, one is able to gain an understanding of the true nature of t hi ngs.  The Buddha a l s o  gai ned h i s  at t ai nment s by resting in this state o f equanimity. If one cannot rest in equanimity, one will not gain the understanding of the true nature o f phenomena. The m ind will be like a bird’ s  feather blown in the wind, unable to stay in one place.The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

INSIGHT [lhag mthong]

4Vipa s y a n a: Insi ght Medi t a t i onThe explanation of vipasyana, or insight medita­tion, is divided into five parts. These are the prerequisite conditions for vipasyana, the differ­ent forms of vipasyana, the categorizations of the nature of vi pas yana,  t he met hods of medi t at i on,  and t he mea­sure of accomplishment. The first section deals with the conditions necessary for vipasyana m editation. Kamalaslla in his second book of the Stages o f Medita­tion d e s c r i b e s  t h r e e  c o n d i t i o n s  n e c e s s a r y  t o  d e v e l o p  vipasyana.The Prerequi sites for Pract i ci ng VipasyanaFirst of all one needs to learn how to develop vipasyana meditation because one doesn’ t  nat ural l y pos s es s  t hi s  knowledge. Therefore, one must rely on a pure being to give dharm a teachings, and this being should be very learned and have studied and understood the texts and the com m entaries on the Buddha’s teachings. It should be someone with actual experience of the teachings and someone who in his or her compassion will take care of the pupil. In this age there are m any dharm a books and many peopl e r ea d t hem a nd medi t at e accor di ng t o what  they have read. This leads to various difficulties such as65

finding their bodies shaking or working very hard w ith­out getting any signs of accomplishment from their meditation. One r eal l y needs t o depend on a  speci al  and learned teacher because a book cannot adapt the instruc­tion to one’s own nature and capabilities. Therefore, one needs to rely on a special being who is able to teach in accordance w ith one’ s specific abilities.There are different kinds of teachers. Some are very scholarly and give thorough explanations based on the commentaries on various texts. Others may not be very scholarly but give instructions based on a great deal of personal experience of meditation so he or she can explain what will happen in meditation. There is also what i s  c al l ed t he ol d lady’ s  pointi ng i nst ructi on.  Thi s is like an instruction from  an old lady w h o  really d o esn ’t know very much, but i s  able to point out the key things to look for. The com m entaries on m editation do not give points on the direct experience of meditation or these “pointing o u t” instructions. It is therefore im por­tant for meditators to receive direct instruction from  an experienced teacher.The benefi t s of a  genuine teacher come not just from being with and having conversations with the teacher, but from receiving instructions that are beneficial to one’ s  progress. A genuine teacher also gives the actual teachings o f the Buddha or the experiences o f the bo- dhisattvas and great siddhas, and not teachings of his own personal creation. The teachings that are the most beneficial are those that come from a pure or genuine text, that is, the actual teachings (sutras) of t he Buddha or the commentaries (sastras), w h i c h  c o m e  f r o m  t h e  great bodhisattvas or the great siddhas. The teacher should be able to read and understand these teachingsThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
66

and be able to pass them on to his or her pupils. Therefore, one should receive the teachings from one’ s  teacher and contem plate them  so that one develops an understanding of them. The second point, then, i s that one must receive teachings from the teacher.In general, Buddhist practice involves the correct view, meditation, and proper conduct. W ith the correct view we are able to meditate and through meditation we develop proper conduct. Therefore the root of these is the view . To develop the correct view, we d o n ’t ju st receive these teachings, but rather we m ust analyze and examine them continuously. We shouldn’ t accept teach­ings w ith blind faith, however, but we should analyze and examine them so that we can cut through our uncertainty and doubt that the teachings from our teacher are correct and will lead us on the path. From  this develops a definite view that the teacher’s instruc­tions are genuine, and this is called the definitive or correct viewpoint. Correct viewpoint is the principal causal condition for vipasyana. These three aspects o f depending on a teacher, receiving the teachings, and analyzing them develop the correct view of vipasyana.To develop the correct viewpoint, we m ust rely not on the provisional meaning, but on the definitive mean­ing. Provisional meanings are teachings given by the Buddha to persons of l esser capabilit ies who were not able to believe or grasp the actual teachings. The defini­tive m eanings are those that describe things as they actually are. To have a genuine view one must depend on the definitive meaning. One has to recognize directly what  i s  t he t r ue meani ng of phenomena and di st i ngui sh it from  the provisional m eaning. W hen the teachings o f the vajrayana were transm itted to Tibet, the practice o fVipasyana: Insight Meditation
67

contemplating the teachings by relying on the commen­
taries was developed. Some Chinese and som e Western 
scholars state that this is a defect in the Tibetan Buddhist 
tradition because it relies so heavily on commentaries 
instead o f relying on the actual words o f the Buddha. 
The rel i ance on commentaries, however,  has a  very 
special purpose because w hen the Buddha gave teach­
ings, he gave particular teachings to various individuals 
according to their particular nature so that some of his 
teachings were the provisional truths and som e were the 
definitive truths.
If one has to go through the Buddha’ s  teachings 
deciding which teachings are provisional and which are 
definitive with logical analysis, one could make many 
mistakes. But the Buddha prophesied that various mas­
ters w ould com e in the future and w rite com m entaries 
on the teachings to show which teachings are provi­
sional and which definitive. In particular, the Treasury o f  
Knowledge  mentions t wo l ong,  pure t raditions: t he tra­
dition of Nagarjuna who founded the tradition of the 
profound view, and the tradition of Asanga who 
founded the tradition of vast conduct. These two great 
masters were able to clearly distinguish the provisional 
and definitive teachings of the Buddha with their com­
mentaries. One should rely on the commentaries of 
these two great masters not only for differentiating 
between these two meanings, but also for their vast 
content. The Prajndpdramitd  t e a c h i n g s ,  f o r  e x a m p l e ,  
contain twelve volumes, and it would be difficult to go 
through these deciding the definitive and provisional 
meani ng of each passage.  Hence t hese commentaries 
summarize the vast teachings of the Buddha and give 
their real meanings. For example, Asanga in the Orna­The P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsight

ment of Clear Realization c o n d e n s e d  t h e  Prajhaparamita into just twenty pages. There are also teachings o f the Buddha that have obscure or hidden meanings or there are teachings that are very short and concise. So there are commentaries that elucidate and expand the mean­ing o f these teachings in detail. For this reason com m en­taries are very im portant and their understanding is a necessary condition for the development of vipasyana.The Different Forms of VipasyanaThere are four main forms of vipasyana. The first kind of vi pasyana i s  t he vi pas yana of t he Ti rt hi ka (non-  Buddhist) traditions and is found primarily in India. These non-Buddhist traditions practice samatha medi­tation to pacify and eliminate m ost of the obvious klesas. The second kind of vipasyana is the vipasyana teachings the Buddha gave to the sravakas and pratyek- abuddhas who could not understand the very profound or vast meaning. The third kind of vipasyana i s  the vipasyana of the bodhisattvas who follow the six para- mitas. These teachings are very profound and vast. The fourth kind of vipasyana is that which uses bliss as a special m ethod for quickly attaining realization, or the vipasyana of the mantrayana.In the vipasyana o f the Tirthika tradition, one con­templates the “peaceful and the coarse” aspects. For example, one might contemplate a coarse klesa such as anger in one’ s  meditation. One can realize that anger is harmful to oneself and others and that without anger the m ind w ould be peaceful and happy. So it is easy to see the benefits o f the absence o f this obvious klesa o f anger, which is peace. So with this meditation one canVipasyana: Insight Meditation

then overcome anger. O ne may wonder if there is something wrong with this non-Buddhist form of vi­pasyanâ. Actually, there isn’t anything wrong with this tradition, which is called the “com m on tradition” be­cause it is com m on to Buddhists and non-Buddhists. In the Buddhist tradition this vipasyanâ is know n as the worldly l e vel  of vipasyanâ because one recognizes the mi nd poi sons and t hei r  f a u l t s  and t r i e s  t o make t he mi nd still and stable. The practice is perform ed to calm the mind and subj ugat e t he mind poi sons rat her t han t o understand emptiness or the absence of self. Calming the m ind eliminates the faults on the level o f the desire realm so that one can attain the first level o f m ental stability in the form realm.The vipasyanâ of the srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas (the solitary buddhas) is for those w ho are w ithout the necessary fortitude to accomplish complete Buddahood. These two kinds of realized beings, the srâvakas and the pratyekabuddas, are found within the hïnayâna tradi­tion. The difference between them  is the accum ulation of mer i t .  If t her e i s  some accumul at i on of mer i t ,  t hen one is a srâvaka; if there is a  great accumulation of merit, then one i s  a  pratyekabuddha. However,  in terms of samat ha and vi pasyanâ meditation t here i s  onl y a  slight difference between them because both meditate on the four noble truths. The practice of srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas is based on the four noble truths, which ar e divided into sixteen aspect s ( s e e  t able 2 ) .  With this type o f vipasyanâ, peace is based on the four noble truths as a description of samsâra and nirvâna. The first noble truth is a description of samsâra, which is called the truth o f suffering. The second truth of origination looks at the cause o f samsâra, which originates fromThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

karma and the klešas. The third truth of cessation occurs if karma and the klešas are eliminated and this results in nirvana. The fourth truth is following and practicing the truth o f the path. In the vipašyaná o f šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas the actual nature of these four truths has to be understood along w ith their subcategories. The truth of suffering i s  divided into impermanence, suffering, absence o f self, and emptiness. The truth of origination, the truth of cessation, and the truth of the path are also divided into four parts, making a total of sixteen subdivisions.What  a r e  t he f our  nobl e t r ut hs ? There i s  s a ms á r a ,  from which one seeks to gain liberation, and there is nirvana, which one seeks to attain. One wishes to attain liberation from  samsára, the nature o f which is suffer­ing. So the first truth o f suffering is that one wishes to attain liberation from the suffering of samsára. One wishes to attain nirvána, and this i s  the third truth of cessation. However, one cannot simply say one wants to attain liberation and achieve it. This is because all phe­nomena arise from causes, so samsára and nirvána also arise from  a cause. This cause is the second truth of origination, which is karma and the klešas. Therefore, one needs to eliminate the cause of samsára, which is karma and the mind poisons. When these are elimi­nated, one has attained freedom from the truth of suffering, from  samsára. To be able to attain freedom from the truth of suffering and samsára, one m ust be able to eliminate the origin of suffering. O ne can’ t eliminate karma and the klešas directly because their source is ego-clinging that has to be eliminated. The way to eliminate this i s  the fourth noble truth of path which i s  the meditation on s el f l es s nes s ,  that i s ,  to med-The Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insig ht

itate on the five aggregates and one’ s association o f the idea o f “self” or “ m ine” to these five aggregates. Through r eal i zat i on of s e l f l e s s n e s s ,  one c a n  el i mi nat e the clinging to a self, and the m ind poisons will natu­rally subside. W hen these subside, one will be able to practice the path, which is the fourth truth, and finally attain the truth of cessation.In the vipasyana o f the Tirthikas there is the partial elimination of the obvious mental negativities, but they are not completely eliminated. In the vipasyana o f the sravakas the cause of the klesas is identified as the clinging to the idea of self or of “I” or “m ine.” A belief in a self is a delusion because actually there is no self or things that belong to a self. W hen one is able to realize the absence o f self in vipasyana m editation, then the natural clinging to self just vanishes. So the main medi­tation of the sravakas is the meditation on the absence of s e l f .  An exampl e of t hi s ego-cl i ngi ng happened t o me t he other da y when I  not i ced that  one of t he l i nks i n the metal strap o f m y watch was broken. W hen I saw that, I thought, “ O h no, the strap m ight break and I will lose my watch!” I  was worried even though only a  tiny bit of metal was missing. W hen one examines the watch, one cannot f i n j d  any “mine” associated with the watch—it was made in a  factory and it  i s  just a  piece of metal that didn’ t  originate from me in any way. If I  were without the delusion of “my” associated with the watch, I  wouldn’ t have experienced the discomfort and suffering of seeing the broken link.A lot of people think that Buddhism is an unpleasant practice that makes us unhappy. Buddhism teaches the nature of suffering, the absence of self, arid imperma­nence. We may think that to meditate on these can makeVipasyana: Insight Meditation

us uncom fortable, and make us lose our feeling of confidence and so on. Buddhism does teach these, but it is taught because we need this inform ation to attain liberation from  suffering. Once we understand the na­ture o f suffering, we can be liberated from  it. T hrough this understanding o f the nature o f suffering, our w is­dom will also' increase and develop.Ordinary bei ngs h a v e  a n i nnat e ego-cl i ngi ng.  Thi s clinging to a self occurs in a child; no one needs to teach it. A nim als also have this clinging to self. B ut w hat is this clinging? There is really no stable object for this clinging; it is a delusion. Sometimes one thinks this self is the m ind. B ut w hen one exam ines the self m ore closely, one discovers that it is not in the hair, not in the bone, the eyes, the nose, the brain, and so on. One finds that these are only body parts w ith no self identi­fied w ith them. O ne’ s body is just a physical aggregate of form and t he sel f i s  nowhere t o be found.Perceiving the body as not being the self, one may think that the mind is the self. But the m ind is just a succession of instants, like the flow of a river w ith each instant being a new instant of mind. There are thoughts one had yesterday, thoughts one has now, and thoughts one will have in the future. One may wonder if a  previous thought will ever come back again. It does not come back. When one was a child, one had a child’ s  mind; when one grows up and becomes ol d,  the mind is different. T h e m in d  has different characteristics, dif­ferent thoughts, a different process of thinking, and a different degree of understanding. Even the mind be­tween yesterday and today is different. There is a contin­uous succession of different kinds of thoughts and states of mi nd.  So  one a s ks ,  “I s  t he sel f of t oday,  t he mind ofThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight

yesterday?” No, it is gone. Then, “Is the self of today, the m ind of now?” No, because the m ind of now is going to disappear, so that can’ t be one’ s  self either. In a further analysis there is visual consciousness, auditory consciousness, mental consciousness, and so on. Even mental consci ousness i s  a  mixture of di fferent  t hi ngs.  There i s  the grasping at something that i s  red, a  concep­tion that som ething is white, etc., so the mental con­sciousness is an accumulation of different parts and therefore is not a single entity that one could say is one’ s self. H aving understood the absence o f a self, one m ed­itates on selflessness and gains understanding o f the four noble truths. Through this process one attains the vipa­syana of the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas.The meditation of vipasyana of the bodhisattva of the mahayana path i s  the meditation on the sel f l es sness of phenomena. A bodhisattva practices meditation based on the six paramitas. There is the selflessness of the individual already discussed and the selflessness o f phe­nomena. This second kind of selflessness is the realiza­tion that inner consciousness and external phenom ena are naturally peaceful and empty. So the mahayana meditator b e l i e v e s  t hat  t he root of s amsar a i s  t he kl e s a s  and that the root of the klesas is ego-clinging., Eliminat­ing clinging to a self is the way to be liberated from  samsara.To elim inate klesas, the m ahayana m editators m edi­tate on the nature of external and internal phenom ena in detail to discover that they are completely insubstan­tial, like bubbles in water. W ith this realization the klesas naturally disappear. The belief in the reality of external phenomena is called the obscuration of knowl­edge, and when this obscuration is eliminated there isVipasyana: Insight. Meditation

liberation from  samsara. The bodhisattvas therefore meditate on emptiness (sunyata). In the Heart Sutra t h e  Buddha s a ys  there are “no eyes,  no ears, no nose, no tongue, [etc.]” and that there is “no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, [etc.]” One might interpret this as the Buddha saying there are literally no eyes, and so on. When t he  Buddha g a v e  t h i s  t e ac hi ng,  he  wa s  e xpl ai ni ng what one exper i ences when one r es t s  i n  t hi s  st at e of samadhi meditation. He didn’t explain this in the sutra because at the time his pupils were in a meditative state and therefore were able to understand the teaching wi t hout  expl anat i on.  The Buddha t aught  t hi s  wa y  i n t he Heart Sutra a n d  t h e  o t h e r  Prajnaparamita s u t r a s .  T h e s e  teachings are explained in com m entaries such as C han- drakirti’ s  Entering into the Middle Way; b y  e x a m i n i n g  cause and effect he demonstrates the nature o f emptiness by examining the nature of cause. There is also Master Jnanagarbha who, in his Differentiation of the 1wo Truths, shows the nature o f emptiness through the analysis of the effect. Then there is N agarjuna’ s Knowledge of the Middle Way, w h i c h  d e m o n s t r a t e s  t h e  e m p t i n e s s  o f  a l l  phenomena.In Tibet there are a num ber o f great com m entaries on emptiness, such as that of Lama Mipam, who de­scribed how the Indian master Santaraksita came to Tibet and wrote the Adornment of the Middle Way, whi ch explains emptiness in terms of things not being “one thing or m any things.” M ipam  describes this approach as being very powerful and easy to understand. For example, for things to be real, they must be a single thing; let us say for a “hand” to exist it m ust be one thing: a hand. If one looks at it, one sees a hand; if one shows it to others, they agree it is a hand. However,The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
76

examining it more closely, one sees that it is a thumb, a finger, skin, flesh and bones, and so on. So it is not a hand, but, as the Buddha said, it is just an aggregation of a l l  s or t s  of pa r t s  t ha t  h a v e  come t oget her .  S o  t he hand really is the appearance that arises from  the interdepen­dence of parts that we call a hand, but' there is no real hand there. It is like this for all things, and using this logic, one becomes convinced o f the nature o f em pti­ness.The vipasyana meditation of the mahayana i s  on the realization o f emptiness, which is also called dependent origination. This means that all phenomena that arise have a dependence upon other phenom ena and therefore no true existence of their own. For example, with the reflection o f the m oon on water, there is no real m oon in the water, but due to the interdependence o f the moon i n  t he  s ky and t he  wat er  on t he  gr ound,  a  reflection of the m oon appears. Also, when one exam­ines the water to see w here the m oon is, there isn’t a single location where the m oon’ s reflection is. In this same way, all phenomena originate through dependence upon something else and have no true existence of their own. The realization of this fact is the realization of emptiness, and with this realization, the klesas cease. So to put an end to the klesas, one meditates on emptiness.Taking another example, if one takes a piece of paper and rips it up, the act doesn’ t upset anyone. But when one takes out a piece of paper that happens to be a ten- dollar bill and begins to rip it, the act suddenly becomes something important. W hy is it suddenly important? It is im p o rtan t because everyone agrees that a ten-dollar bill is im portant, but in actual fact, it is just a piece of paper. W hy is something made important by people?Vipasyana: Insight Meditation
77

There i s  no particular reason, it just happens that every­one thinks that it is important. So this is dependent origination— the value of various things is dependent on what ever yone t hi nks.  Thi s i s  not onl y t r ue with paper  money; everyone thinks that gold i s  more val uabl e than iron. W hy is gold m ore valuable? Simply because every­one thinks so. Gold itself does not have amrita f l o wi n g  out of it; gold i s  just a metal. In this way, the mind clings to things; it perceives some things as good, other things as bad, but nothing is ultim ately good or bad in itself. It is just a m ental perception and the nature o f things is emptiness.Everything comes into being through interdepen­dence. For example, if one has two pieces of paper, one that is small and one that is big, they are small and big because they depend on each other. If one puts a larger piece of paper next to them, then the big piece becomes the m edium -sized piece. In itself it is not a big piece of paper or a small piece of paper. Large and small, good and bad, beautiful and ugly are all creations of the mind and do not have actual existence. There is a fable to illustrate this point. There was once a rabbit w ho was resting in the shade o f a tree by the lake. Suddenly the wind broke off one of t he branches of t he t r ee and i t  f e l l  into the water, m aking a big splash. This sound fright­ened the rabbit and w ithout thinking he ran away. While running he encountered two mice. They asked him  w hy he was running and the rabbit said, “There was a great sound back there.” That frightened the mice and they began running as well. So, we are like the mice, we don’ t ask why a  ten-dollar bill i s  valuable, we simply answer, “Well, everyone thinks so.” Things don’t have a natural existence o f  their ow n, b u t the m in d  ju st clingsThe Practice of Tranquillity & I n s i g h t
78

to them. So the story continues. While all the animals were 'running, they met a  lion who asked them why they were running away. They answered that there was a terrible sound in the lake and the lion said, “ Well, it was just a  sound. Maybe we should investigate what the sound was before running away.” Then they all went together to the lake and saw the branch floating in the water. Similarly, we are always thinking, “This i s  good, this is bad,” and so on. If we analyze these thoughts and see that these things have no existence of their own, our mi nd c a n  become pe acef ul  wi t hout  t he k l e s a s  and we  can then gain freedom from  delusion and realize the true nature of things.For an example of dependent origination we may think, “I feel very happy in the environm ent. In other places, I get depressed and hom esick.” Through depen­dent origination we experience pleasant and unpleasant places. W hen we meditate, however, there are no thoughts of pleasant and unpleasant and we don’ t have thoughts o f arriving at nice or unpleasant places. In­stead, we have the realization of the sameness of all places and so we have a state of peace w ithout the suffering involved in thinking we are in an undesirable place.There i s  a  story about Buddha’ s  younger brother Nanda (not  Ananda who was hi s  cousi n)  who had a  wife called Pundarika whom he liked very much. The Buddha asked him to come and r ecei ve t eachings, but Nanda never  went because he was worried that t hese teachings w ould make him  want to becom e a m onk and he would have to leave his beautiful wife. One day Buddha went to their home and told him, “You must come along with m e.” Through his miraculous powers,Vipasyana: Insight Meditation
79

the Buddha took N anda to a jungle o f m onkeys w ithout eyes. Buddha asked Nanda, “W ho do you think is the prettiest, these monkeys or your wife?” Nanda an­swered, “There is no comparison, Pundarika is one hundred thousand times prettier than these monkeys.” Then the Buddha with hi s miraculous powers took Nanda to a  god realm fi l l ed with goddesses. He then asked him, “W hich is more beautiful, these goddesses or Pundarika?” and Nanda answered, “Well , now that I  look at these goddesses, Pundarika and the m onkeys look pretty m uch the sam e.” That is how interdepen­dence makes some things look pretty and others look ugly. Objects are merely creations of the mind or mental concepts.If one examines phenomena with logic and establishes that they are em pty, one can gain an understanding of emptiness, but one doesn’ t gain a direct experience of emptiness. Also this logical method takes a long time. In the vajrayana approach outer phenom ena are under­stood to be empty; but the practice is to observe the mind. The mind i s  t he source of a l l  happiness and a l l  suffering, the source of all craving and all anger, the source of all love and compassion; whatever occurs comes from  the mind. W hen we first examine the mind, we think that it must be very powerful to create all this. However, looking inward, we are completely unable to find the mind; it is not outside the body, nor inside the body, nor in between these two. So the mind i s empty. When we  s a y  t he  mi nd i s  empt y,  we  don’ t  mean t hat  the m ind doesn’t exist like the “horns o f a rabbit,” which obviously do not exi st .  Nor i s  t he emptiness of mi nd l i ke  empty s pa ce  t hat  ha s  not hi ng i n  i t .  Rat her t he nature of mind is natural clarity. When we try to findThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
80

the actual nature o f m ind directly, we cannot do so. It is both clarity and emptiness. When we examine mind, it is n o t ju st co m p lete dullness o r unconsciousness like a stone, but there is an uninterrupted continuum  o f clar­ity. The m ind is norm ally full o f thoughts and prob­lems, but w hen we have understood the emptiness and clarity of the mind, then everything becomes very gentle and peaceful. So the text says the vipasyana in the vajrayana has the nature of bliss.The study of emptiness i n the sutras i s  the study of the Prajndpdramita. I n  t h e  v a j r a y a n a  o r  t a n t r a  t e a c h i n g s  the realization o f emptiness is accomplished by looking at m ind itself. Norm ally one thinks of the m ind as being very strong and powerful, especially when all the thoughts and klesas arise. But when one carefully ex­amines to see where the mind actually is, one finds that there is nothing there, just a state o f peace. This is called the state o f great bliss because there is an absence of suffering and klesas. While meditating one may think, “I  cannot meditate because there ar e s o many thoughts coming up.” But when one examines where the thoughts come from  and what they really are, one finds that they do not exist. There is just this natural state of peace. W hen I was very young, m y teacher would tell me that a l l  phenomena were empty, but I  thought that this was im possible and could not be right. Later w hen studying the texts, I  realized that phenomena were empty after all, but I  did not see how the mind could be empty. There were so many thoughts and there was a  power to all these thoughts and feelings, so it was impossible for the m ind to be em pty. But after receiving the instructions for m editation and analyzing the m ind, I re alized , “ O h , th e  m i n d  is e m p ty  a fte r a ll.” S o firstVipasyana: Insight Meditation

one discovers that phenomena are empty, then one analyzes the m ind and finds that it is also em pty. W ith analysis it is easy to understand the emptiness of mind. What  i s  d i f f i c ul t  i s  t o f a mi l i a r i z e  ones el f  wi t h and habi t ­uate oneself to that understanding. Just to analyze the mind t o s e e  t hat  i t s  nat ure i s  empty i s  not ver y benef i ­cial. For instance, w hen suffering begins it is o f little help to simply think, “The nature of suffering is em p­tiness.” But if one accustoms one’s m ind to the under­standing of emptiness, then the mind poisons will be eliminated and suffering will be pacified.So in this lifetime different klesas such as anger have arisen and have been accepted as real. Sometimes anger becomes so strong that one falls under its power and says harsh things or even hits or kills som eone. In the vajrayana if anger arises, one thinks, “Previously I have fallen under its power, but this tim e I am going to look at the anger and determine what this anger is, where it came from, and where it is located now .” W hen one examines the nature of anger in this way, one finds the anger is not there. One can’ t say, “This is the anger” or “This i s  what anger is like” or “The anger arises from this spot” or “T he anger is created by this.” It is like seeing som eone in a film— there is an appearance of a person, but actually no one is there. In the same way, there is the appearance of anger, but it really isn’t there. To realize this about anger, one doesn’t analyze it logi­cally, but one directly examines the nature o f anger in oneself.There are six root afflictions, or klesas. The first i s  anger, s o  one  l ooks  f or  wher e a nger  f i r s t  a p pe a r s ,  wher e it comes from , w here it stays, and so on. O ne does the same for the second klesa, which is craving or desire f orThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
82

external objects. The third klesa is ignorance a n d  t h e  fourth is pride. T h e  f i f t h  k l e s a  i s  doubt o r  uncertainty, which ha s  a  posi t i ve or negat i ve form.  The si xt h i s  afflicted view, wh i c h  me a n s  t h e  b e l i e f  i n  s e l f ,  a  c l i n g i n g  to a self. These are the six root m ind poisons as de­scribed in the commentaries. W ith each of these one looks for where they first appear, where they dwell, and where they go.  This i s  anal yt i c meditation and through it one realizes the nature o f the poisons. W hen one has this realization, one rests one’ s m ind in this realization. In this way one obtains the realization of the emptiness of t hi ngs oft en descri bed a s  t he union of empt i ness and knowledge. This knowledge is clarity, an activity that doesn’ t have any actual true nature because it i s empti­ness itself.8  It is just a function, but not an actual thing in itself. Clarity is like a quality or attribute, but there is no basis to that quality. T h ere is a process o f  k n o w ­ing, but there is no knower w ho knows. O ther than its nature, it is just emptiness. So one has this union of clarity and emptiness or this union of knowledge and emptiness. Atlsa in his meditation instructions says that normally we think of mind as being a combination of past, present, and future thoughts. We put these to­gether and think that it is mind. If we analyze it, however, we find that past thoughts don’ t exist, that they have gone and aren’t there any more, that is, they are nonexistent. Future thoughts have not yet been created so they are naturally empty. So what we have is just the present, which is a very brief period of time. Examining the present mind i s very difficult because we find nothing there w ith any color, shape, form , or nature. So we find present mind is not really anything either and is therefore also empty.Vipasyana: Insight Meditation
83

Having understood the nature of emptiness through analytic meditation, we now look to see who is know­ing, w ho has this understanding, and we find the knower doesn’ t exist. So we recognize this indivisibility of knowing and empt i ness.  Thi s i s  known a s  di scri mi ­nating wisdom or discriminating prajna.There are siddhas, that i s ,  accomplished vajrayana masters, who have said that when one looks directly at anger, the anger disappears. Anger has its own em pti­ness. It attains its own natural em pty state. Previously, it has been said that there is no direct rem edy that one can apply to anger that is correct in the context of hinayana and mahayana meditation. But in vajrayana meditation t here i s  the remedy of looking directl y into the nature of anger.9Categories o f VipasyanaThere are three main categories of vipasyana: the vipa- syanas of the four essences, t h e  v i p a s y a n a  o f  t h e  three doorways, and t he  vi pas yana of t he  six investigations.The four essences of vipasyana are described in the Explanation of the View s u t r a  a n d  i n  As a n g a ’ s  Compen­dium o f the Abhidharma. I n  t h i s  a n a l y s i s  t h e r e  a r e  t w o  categories of vipasyana— differentiation and complete differentiation. Each of these categories has two as­pects— examination and analysis— so that there are ac­tually four categories. Differentiation involves the un­derstanding or prajna that can distinguish between all the various kinds o f phenom ena. Com plete differentia­tion is the understanding that distinguishes the actual nature of all phenomena. Examination is the gaining of an understanding o f som ething on an obvious level.The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
84

Analysis is gaining an understanding on a  very subtle level.The vipasyanas of the four natures a r e :  (i) differentia­tion through examination, (2) differentiation through analysis, (3) complete differentiation through examina­tion, and (4) complete differentiation through analysis. But in the Explanation of the View s u t r a  e a c h  of  t h e s e  four categories is divided again to make sixteen catego­ries in all. T he first category (differentiation through examination) is divided into four degrees of examina­tion, nam ely (a) perfect examination, which means the examining is done very well, (b) definitive examination, in w hich a m ore com plete understanding results, (c) perfect evaluation, which is even more complete, and (d) essential exam ination, w hich is the m ost com plete. So each of these four essences of vipasyana has four degrees, making sixteen categories in all.In the Compendium of the Abhidharma As a nga  g i v e s  a  description of the vipasyana with four essences in terms of t hei r  e f f e c t ,  t hat  i s ,  i n t er ms of t hei r  act i vi t y.  Asanga describes the first two essences of vipasyanas, the differ­entiation of phenomena and the complete differentiation of phenomena, a s  remedi es for negat i ve propensi t i es (Skt. dausthulya, Tib. naga len) and the conceptualization of phenomena.  The l as t  t wo e s s e n c e s  of vi pasyana,  through examination and through analysis, eliminate what needs t o be el i mi nat ed,  s uch a s  t he mi st aken b e l i e f s  about phenomena. With these eliminated one can rest in an unm istaken understanding.In the Explanation of the View sutra there i s  a  descrip­tion of the vipasyana of the three doorways, or  e nt r a nc e s .  In this sutra M aitreya asks the Buddha, “H ow  m any kinds of vipasyana meditations are there?” The BuddhaVipasyana: Insight Meditation
85

replies that there are three kinds. First, there is the vipasyana that arises from conceptual characteristics. If one meditates, for example, on selflessness one doesn’ t simply think about selflessness but one contemplates the reasons, proofs, and characteristics o f selflessness. By going through these and thinking them over, one is able to develop a certain understanding o f selflessness. O ne develops the insight that arises from  contemplating the conceptual characteristics of something. The second of the vipasyanas o f the three doors is the insight that arises from  investigation. O nce one has developed the certainty of the first doorway, then one rests one’ s  mind in that certainty and this is the second doorway. The third doorway arises from  analysis. Because o f familiar­ization w ith and habituation to certainty, one rests directly within the understanding of selflessness.Next i s  the vipasyana of the six investigations into the characteristics o f things. Three kinds of understanding come from these six investigations. First is the investiga­tion o f meaning, in which one has to investigate the words of t he dharma and fi nd out what i s  t he meaning behind the words. Second is the investigation o f things o r  t h e  investigation o f external phenom ena and internal ob­jects, w hich refers to m ind and m ental events. The understanding of the mind is arrived at through the understanding of the eight consciousnesses. The under­standing of mental events is the understanding of the klesas— the negativities of the mind. The investigation of ext ernal obj ect s i s  the understanding of t he external sensory experiences o f sight, sound, smell, taste, and physical sensation. This is the understanding of the five aggregates of form, sensation, recognition, mental events, and consciousness, the twelve ayatanas, whichThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
86

are the source of perception and so on. Third is the investigation o f characteristics, w h i c h  i s  e x a m i n i n g  t h e  object in more detail; for example, discovering that the visual consciousness perceives a visual object, the ear consciousness perceives sounds, etc. One examines the actual characteristics of all the different aspects in m ore detail. O ne investigates, for example, the visual form  and identifies it as being the object of visual conscious­ness. Generally, there are two kinds of wisdom — the wi sdom of t he t r ue nat ur e of t hi ngs  and wi sdom of t he variety of things. First one has to examine all outer and inner objects to gain an understanding of their qualities. When one h a s  a t t a i ned t h i s  under s t andi ng,  t hen one  c a n  understand their true nature.The next three kinds of realization deal  with the actual nature of things. These are the investigation o f direction, investigation o f time, a n d  investigation through reasoning. W e  c a n  e a s i l y  U n d e r s t a n d  e m p t i n e s s  w i t h  t h e  investigation o f direction and time. We norm ally think that there is a north, a south, an east, and a west. We think of directions as having an actual existence. We also talk about “here” and “there” as if there really were a “here” and a  “there.” But on closer examination, for example, one could say the wooden table in front of me is on the east side o f the throne. W hen one moves the table a little, then one w ould say it is north o f the throne. Direction, in fact, has no solid reality. So the investigation o f direction leads to an understanding o f emptiness.The second investigation of the nature of things i s  the investigation o f time. O ne usually thinks that there is a past, a present, and a future or one thinks in terms of a day, a m onth, a year, and so on. But when one examinesVipasyana: Insight Meditation
87

this m ore closely, one finds that past does not really exist. W here is the present? One finds that other than being a conceptual projection on things, time has no reality o f its own.The third investigation of the nature of things i s  through reason. The Buddha said that his teachings should be examined and not taken on trust. For exam­ple, if one is buying gold, it wouldn’ t be correct to simply accept the seller’ s word that it is gold. One should test it by heating it with a flame to see whether it changes color. The gold m ight have a different metal inside so next one has to cut it open. Finally, there mi ght  b e  s ome f i n e  pa r t i c l e s  of nongol d i n  t he  l ump.  S o  one has to rub it against a stone to see if it is pure gold. In the same way, the Buddha said that his teachings should not be taken on trust, but one should engage in the process of investigation so that one can develop an understanding of the actual nature of things. Once one has gained this understanding, one can apply it to phenomena.There are four kinds of reasoning. The first two relate to som ething arising from  activity. The first is the reasoning o f dependence a n d  i s  i n v o l v e d  wi t h  c a u s e  a n d  effect. Using this reasoning, one can develop an under­standing of how one’s present life is due to events in a previous life. Since this is difficult to prove and under­stand, the Buddha taught cause and effect by reasoning, saying that if something exists, it is dependent and m ust have arisen from  previous conditions or a cause. For example, a flower does not appear by itself but is dependent upon the previous conditions of a  seed, soil, air, water, and so on. M any things have to com e to­gether for the flower to come into existence. So what­The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
88

ever exists is dependent upon previous causes and con­
ditions. This is true of one’ s  body and one’ s  mind, 
which are t he ef f ect  of previ ous caus es  and conditions 
in one’s previous lifetimes.
The second kind of reasoning i s  the reasoning o f func­
tion.  T h i s  i s  t h e  r e a s o n i n g  o f  d e p e n d e n t  e f f e c t ,  w h i c h  
means that an effect depends on a  particular cause.  By 
understanding the first kind of reasoning and this sec­
ond kind, one is able to avoid suffering by understand­
ing that every cause has an effect and every effect has a 
causal condition. For example, in the Guru Rinpoche 
practice the mantra om ye dharm a  het u  trab ow a , etc., 
can be translated as “All phenomena arise from causes.” 
The Buddha taught that a l l  phenomena are an effect  that 
had to arise due to a certain cause. The mantra says “All 
the causes have been explained by the Buddha.” T hat is 
the second sentence in the mantra. If one wishes to 
attain perfect happiness, one must be able to find the 
correct cause of this happiness. To stop suffering, which 
is the result o f causes, one m u st stop the causes o f  
suffering. Therefore, one can find out how to eliminate 
suffering and attain happiness in the Buddha’ s teachings, 
which i s  done through the t wo ki nds of reasoning—t he 
reasoning of a cause having an effect and the reasoning 
of an e f f e c t  bei ng dependent  on a  c a u s e .  Thi s means  
that whatever exists will create a result. Thus external 
objects or internal objects (such as the mind) will create 
results in the future. So the first reasoning of previous 
conditions proves previous lifetimes and the second 
reasoning of function proves future lifetimes.
The third kind of reasoning i s  the reasoning o f validity,  
or how one knows something i s  true. There are three 
subtypes of this reasoning. First, one may experienceVipasyand: Insight Meditation
89

something directly through seeing, hearing, or one of 
the other senses and this is called directly perceived 
validity. Second, there are things one cannot experience 
directly with the senses, but one understands them 
through logical deduction, or deduced validity. For 
example, the understanding of the emptiness of all 
phenomena or that a  previous life must exist are exam­
ples of this second kind of knowledge. The third kind 
of reasoning i s  scri ptural authent ici ty.  One gai ns under­
standing by studying the teachings of the Buddha and 
of schol ars and accompl i shed mast ers.  There i s  a  subj ect  
called pramana  in Sanskrit meaning “valid knowledge.”  
There were two great masters of this in India—Dignaga 
and Dharmakirti. Dignaga said there were three kinds 
of val i d knowledge: that which i s  percei ved di rect l y;  
that which is obtained through deductive reasoning; and 
that which is received through scriptural authority. But 
then Dharm akirti, the other great master o f the pra­
mana, said that there are only two kinds of knowledge, 
direct knowledge and deductive analysis, because scrip­
tural authority is understanding through exam ination 
and analysis, which is in fact the result of direct experi­
ence. So scriptural authority is encompassed by both of 
the other two kinds o f knowledge and is not a separate 
third category.
The fourth kind of reasoning i s  the reasoning o f intrinsic  
nature.  Th e r e  a r e  t w o  k i n d s  of  i n t r i n s i c  r e a s o n s :  r e l a t i v e  
intrinsic nature and absolute intrinsic nature. A n exam ­
ple of the relative aspect is the fact that fire is hot and 
burns. One may ask, “What is the reason that fire is hot 
and burns?” But there really isn’ t any reason except that 
this is the intrinsic nature o f fire. Similarly, one cannot 
ask, “W hy is water wet?” because water is just wet andThe P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsig ht
90

that is the intrinsic nature of water. Similarly, the nature of a l l  phenomena i s  empt y and t hat  i s  j ust  t he i nt r i nsi c nature of all phenomena. There i s no real reason why this is true, it is just som ething that has to be realized.For example, in the beginning one isn’ t certain of the absence of a self or of the nature of emptiness. Through a process o f  reasoning, one can develop a definite u n d er­standing of selflessness and impermanence using logic. By going through these four reasonings, one develops certainty from analytical meditation and through this one gains clarity. Sometimes by doing this analytic meditation too much,  one’ s  ment al  st abi l i t y decr e as e s .  If this happens, one does more nonanalytic meditation in which one just rests the m ind w ithout analyzing. This will bring about more stability.There are six kinds of investigations—investigation of meani ng,  t hi ngs ,  c har act er i s t i cs ,  di r ect i ons ,  t i me,  and reasoning— that can be used to gain an understanding of r el at i ve and absol ut e phenomena.  Vi pasyana can a l s o  be summed up into two types: preparatory vipasyana and actual vipasyana. Preparatory vipasyana, also known as discriminating vipasyana, i s  a preparation stage during which one investigates and analyzes in order to develop a definite understanding. In the actual stage, also called unwavering samadhi, one has gained definite understanding and the mind is able to dwell there.The vipasyana of the four essences,  six investigations, and three doorways are all analytical meditations. In general there are two kinds of meditation: the analytical meditation of t he pandi t a who i s  a  schol ar  and t he nonanalytical meditation or direct meditation of the kusulu, o r  s i m p l e  y o g i .  S o  t h e  a n a l y t i c a l  me d i t a t i o n  o fVipasyana: Insight Meditation

the pandita occurs w hen som ebody examines and ana­
lyzes som ething thoroughly until a very clear under­
standing of it is developed. Doing this, one gains a very 
definite and lasting understanding, so that there is no 
danger of making an error. However, this path of the 
pandita takes a long time. The meditation of the kusulu 
develops from knowing how to meditate, and then 
medi t at i ng ver y ext ens i vel y.  Thi s met hod i s  much 
swifter, but there is a danger of going astray and making 
a m istake. So one usually begins w ith an analysis and 
examination of the reasons and proofs so that a definite 
understanding i s developed. Then one familiarizes one­
self with this and develops an understanding and from  
this one begins the kusulu meditation.
In analytical m editation, for example, one m editates 
on selflessness, and in trying to identify the “self” one 
finds that it doesn’t exist internally, externally, or in 
between. It is similar to samatha meditation in that one 
focuses the m ind on an object, just as one rests the m ind 
on the in- and out-breath in samatha meditation. Simi­
larly, w hen resting on the absence o f self, the m ind is 
kept focused one-pointedly on this and just rests, and 
from this develops the experience of the certainty of the 
absence o f self. It is the same m ethod employed in 
samatha meditation so it is called the analytical medita­
tion on the absence o f self.
Analytic meditation i s  not just hearing, receiving, 
and contemplating the teachings. Instead it is the defi­
nite insight one has gained united with samatha medi­
tation. In sam atha m editation one focuses the m ind on 
breathing or focuses it on no object whatsoever. Here 
one has definite knowledge that is gained through ana­
lytic deduction. This knowledge is joined together w ithThe P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsight

the stability o f m ind in samatha and one meditates on the union o f these two. This is w hat is m eant by analytic medi t at i on.The direct, nonanalytical meditation i s  cal l ed kusulu medi t at i on i n Sans kr i t .  Thi s was  t r ansl at ed a s  tromeh in Tibetan, which means “without complication” or being very simple without the analysis and learning of a great scholar. Instead, the m ind is relaxed and w ithout apply­ing analysis so it just rests in its nature. In the sutra tradition, there are some nonanalytic meditations, but most l y t h i s  t r adi t i on u s e s  anal yt i c medi t at i on.Methods of VipasyanaThe basi s of vipasyana meditation i s  a  state of samadhi, a m editation state w ithout thoughts and concepts. Its primary quality i s that it cuts through all the misconcep­tions, inaccuracies, and m isunderstandings we m ight have. It says in the text that it is necessary to have the viewpoint of the absence of self and without this view­point we cannot develop genuine vipasyana meditation. Therefore, we have to develop this understanding of the absence of self. The text states that if we don’ t have an understanding of what the meditation should be di­rected at, we are like a person w ithout arms trying to hold onto the side of a  cliff. So the basis of meditation is the definite understanding o f the absence o f self. We need to first recognize this, then contemplate it until we have a definite understanding o f the absence of self. Once we h a v e  devel oped t hi s  underst anding,  t hen t he mi nd must  be  a b l e  t o r est  upon t h i s  underst andi ng— relaxed and completely unagitated. If we have the view, but just think intellectually about it, we will not be ableVipasyana: Insight Meditation
93

to properly develop our m editation because we w on’t be able to eliminate the obscurations. Hence the text says that even if we are learned and have studied and under­stood the view of the absence of self, but have not meditated on i t ,  we are l i ke a  miser with great wealth who can’ t  us e  any of i t  be caus e of hi s  st i ngi nes s.  Not only is all of the wealth of a miser of no use to him, but it is also o f no good to others because he doesn’t give it to anyone. Similarly if we have the understanding and view of the absence of self, without meditation we won’ t derive any benefit from  it because we are not able to develop wisdom  and eliminate the klesas. We also then cannot benefit others because we are not able to follow the path and gain enlightenm ent.To sum m arize, to develop the view o f the absence o f self, one has to m editate. O ne needs to study first the teachings o f selflessness, then analyze and contem plate them  so that one can develop a definite understanding of t hi s vi ew.  Then one rest s one’ s  mind on t hat, focused in that view but in a com pletely relaxed state. This resting is like the union of stability of m ind and insight, the union o f samatha and vipasyana. O ne m ust balance the analytic m editation that develops clarity o f m ind with st abi l i t y of mind.  Too much anal yt i c meditation will reduce one’ s  stability. Therefore, one must relax the m ind in a nonanalytic state of meditation. Too m uch nonanalytic meditation will diminish the clarity of mind and one begins to sink into dullness. So one then does repeated analytic meditation to regain one’s balance. Developing both clarity and stability will make the mi nd ver y power f ul .

having done this, to then rest the mind in nonanalytic medi t at i on.Emptiness i s  the essence of the dharma teachings because it is the way we eliminate all the mind poisons and faults. So selflessness and emptiness are very im por­tant. Emptiness can become an obstacle to our under­standing of karma and our practice of good actions because we may think, “Everything is emptiness, noth­ing exists, so I don’ t have to practice dharm a.” So there is d an g er involved in this teaching on em ptiness. N a g a r- juna said that we have to understand emptiness cor­rectly, otherwise it will have a bad effect. In India siddhas would pick up poisonous snakes. Through the power of their mantras on the snake they would be able to perform  miracles and increase prosperity by holding the snake. W ithout the power o f m editation and the power of the mantra anyone holding a poisonous snake would be bitten. In the same way,  if we ha ve  a  good understanding of emptiness, it helps to develop our meditation, but if we ha ve  a  mist aken i dea of emptiness and think there is no need to do good actions, we are in danger of developing an obstacle to our dharma practice.One h a s  t he  accumul at i on of mer i t  a nd t he  accumu­lation o f w isdom  in dharm a practice. The accumulation of wi sdom i s  samat ha and t he accumul at i on of mer i t  i s  vipasyana meditation. The accumulation of merit is done with a pure motivation. One has a  very special object for one’ s actions and for that object one develops faith and makes prayers of supplications and offerings. Sometimes one’ s  meditation will become very clear and it will develop. Som etim es one’s m editation will not go well and it will not make progress. At that time oneVipasyana: Insight Meditation
95

must  de vel op wisdom t o accumul at e mer i t .  S o  one develops faith and devotion and makes offerings, prayers of suppl i cat i on t o t he subl i me or sacr ed obj ect s ,  and a l s o  practices whatever good actions one can to accumulate merit, a  st at e of good karma. Through that one will increase the accum ulation o f w isdom .There i s  another approach that i s  the tradition of Ganden monastery—a  Gelug tradition. In thi s tradition even w hen resting in meditation, one thinks o f the knowledge one has acquired on egolessness and one maintains thi s knowledge by repeatedly thinking “This is like this” and “ T h at is like th a t,” and so on, bringing up the teaching again and again.As mentioned before, when one has developed sama- tha m editation, m any different kinds o f thoughts and images from  internal and external events appear in the mind. These are cal l ed unexamined images. This means that they are not actual external images, but are just the appearance of things, images that arise in the mind. In vipasyana meditation one takes these images and ana­lyzes them  to develop the conviction that they have no true existence of their own. In this m ethod the m ind is turned inward. For example, one doesn’t look at a pillar and think, “Well, this is a pillar and the pillar has no reality o f its ow n,” and so on. Instead one examines whatever appears in the mind and s ees that it has no existence of its own. W hat one needs in this meditation is discrim inating know ledge so that all things are seen as distinct from  each other. O ne needs discrim inating knowledge in meditation because one needs to be able to focus on particular objects in m editation. N othing becomes mixed or overlapping so things do not turn out to be vague, indistinct, or unclear.The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht

There are good mental events and bad mental events. There are al so event s that are continuously present in the m ind and events that are transitory. In fact, there are fifty-one different mental events, of which samadhi and prajna are just two (see table 3, pages 98-100). This means that everyone has samadhi and praj na,  but what differs between individuals is the strength of these two events. O ne m ust increase the power of one’ s samadhi so that one’s m ind becomes m ore stable. The m ental event of prajna is also present in all persons, but it m ust be developed and increased with samadhi so that one can develop a clear and definite understanding. O ne needs to have both of these to develop vipasyana, with samadhi giving the stability and prajna giving the ability to analyze the details o f everything and develop a thor­ough understanding of them.In the Compendium of the Abhidharma Asanga says that vipasyana possesses samadhi and prajna. There are two general kinds of phenomena: that which is perceived (a percept such as a sound) and that which perceives. The sixth consciousness contains things that are perceived. So what is perceived in the mind is also classified as a percept. There are six kinds of percepts (sight, sound, smell, taste, body sensations, and objects o f the sixth consciousness). Internally one has consciousness, which is the perceiver. For exam ple, a visual object is perceived by the sense organ and there is the perceiver, which is visual consciousness. There are five sensory conscious­nesses and a mental consciousness that identifies what is good or bad, remembers, and so O n .  Sometimes the mi nd f o c u s e s  on ext er nal  per cept s  and when t hey appear  not to possess any reality, this i s  known a s  the external indivisibility of appearance and emptiness. “E m pty”Vipasyana: Insight Meditation

For example, when one i s  dreaming of an el ephant ,  t he nature of that  elephant is emptiness because there is no reality to it. If someone asked whether you were dreaming of an ele­phant, you would say yes, and this demonstrates that the appearance o f the elephant was there. But the actual nature of the elephant is still emptiness.An example of meditating on the internal perceiver i s  anger. Anger arises and one examines it not with ordi­nary understanding, but with discriminating knowl­edge. O ne asks where does it come from  or w hat is its source? This is not in terms o f “this person did this to me and that made me angry/’  but in terms of whereioo

did the anger arise from. One looks for its origination and where it is now. Is it inside the body or outside the body or between these two? One analyzes with discrim­inating prajha and tries to discover its location and its nature— what is it like, what color, what shape? With awareness one finds that there is a clarity in the anger and at the same time it is empty of reality. W ith discriminating knowledge one discovers that it is the union of emptiness and awareness.1 0This same way of meditating i s  also used for the six principal mind poisons (klesas). The first mind poison is anger and second is attachment to things such a s  food, wealth, one’ s  body, and so on. When attachment i s  examined in the same way that anger was examined, one is unable to find any reality to the attachment and discovers that it is the union of emptiness and awareness. The third mind poison i s  pride o r  s e e i n g  o n e s e l f  a s  superior to others. O n closer examination, however, it is also the un io n  o f em ptiness and awareness. T h e fo u rth  mi nd poi son i s  ignorance, a n d  t h i s  i s  d i f f e r e n t  f r o m t h e  others because it does not arise so vividly and is more pervasive. There are two kinds of ignorance: mixed ignorance and isolated ignorance. If ignorance accom­panies one of the other mind poisons such as anger, so that one is not aware of the nature of the anger or does not realize that one i s  going to make a  mistake because of anger,  t hi s  i s  mixed i gnorance.  I sol at ed i gnorance i s  not understanding the nature of phenomena. On closer examination one finds that ignorance also has no solid reality and is the union o f emptiness and awareness. The fifth m ind poison is uncertainty, w h i c h  m e a n s  t h a t  w h a t ­ever one’s m ind is focused on, one can’t make a deci­sion. There are two kinds o f uncertainty: favorableVipasyana: Insight Meditation
IOI

uncertainty and unfavorable uncertainty. Favorable un­
certainty occurs when one thinks something probably 
is and unfavorable u n certain ty  is w h en  one thinks so m e­
thing probably isn’t. So in a decision a person w ith 
favorable uncertainty will think yes and a person w ith 
unfavorable uncertainty will think no. O n closer exam­
ination this m ind poison also is the inseparability of 
emptiness and awareness. The sixth mind poison is 
called the nature o f the view  and is the mistaken view that 
“I  exist.” So there i s  a  misconception i n what one 
believes and when one examines it closely w ith discrim­
inating understanding, one finds it also doesn’t have any 
reality and is the indivisibility o f em ptiness and 
awareness.
In vipasyana m editation one m editates on the m ind 
poisons as being the inseparability of emptiness and 
awareness. O ne can also meditate on neutral thoughts. 
Neutral thoughts are thoughts that are neither good nor 
bad. There are two kinds of neutral thoughts: creative 
neutral thoughts and thoughts of activity. Creative neu­
tral thoughts are som ething like “I w ant to m ake din­
ner” and neutral thoughts of activity are something like 
“I  must l e a ve ” or “I  want t o go t o eat.”  These thoughts 
are neutral but one can examine them  to see w ho is 
thinking the thought “I want to eat” and where this 
thought is located. O ne discovers that the nature of 
neutral thoughts is that they have no reality and are the 
indivisibility o f emptiness and awareness.
One t her ef or e exami nes  t he i nt er nal  underst andi ng of 
the indivisibility o f emptiness and awareness and the 
external understanding of the indivisibility of emptiness 
and appearance. The discriminating knowledge under­
stands this indivisibility, and one realizes that the dis­The P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsig ht

criminating knowledge also has no reality, so that the

standing of these two. For example, in the past one 
rubbed two sticks together to make a fire and when the 
fire was started, it burned up the two sticks as well. In 
the same way, the understanding o f the indivisibility of 
emptiness and awareness, and of emptiness and appear­
ance, also has the nature of emptiness. The practice 
instructions o f Atisa say the m ind of the past has ceased 
to exist and the m ind o f the future has not com e into 
existence. The present m ind is difficult to examine 
because it has no color, shape, or location. It is just like 
space— it is unborn and it is not one or m any things. 
Even though it is empty, the clarity of mind never 
ceases. There is this continuous clarity o f m ind and the 
mi nd ne ver  becomes bl ank or l i ke  a  s t one.  One a l s o  
can’ t locate where this clarity comes from.
The meditational state of vipasyana i s  described a s  
having no appearances, which means that there is the 
realization of the inseparability of emptiness and appear­
ances do not have any reality of their own. In spite of 
this emptiness, there is the unceasing clarity o f m ind 
that has no reality of its own so the m ind in meditation 
is free fro m  any com plications o r elaborations. It is n o t 
“existent” and it i s  not “nonexistent” and it i s  not 
“neither existent nor nonexistent” and it i s  not “both 
existent and nonexistent.” It is free from these four 
complications and is neither created or something that 
ceases. Because if it existed, then it m ust be born and if 
it is born then it m ust also die (cease to exist). But there 
is n o th in g  there to be b o rn  o r die. T h ro u g h  this reali­

clinging or grasping, the mind doesn’ t think “This is 
good and has to be kept” and “This i s  bad and has to be 
rejected.” This is w hat is meant by vipasyana medita­
tion.
The Accomplishment of Vipasyana
Gampopa sai d that to obtain the defi niti ve view,  one 
needs to look at the nature of the mind. There is no 
sense in looking elsewhere. A Tibetan story describes 
this. There was a m an nam ed Je, w hich means “strong­
man. ”  He  w a s  v e r y  s t r o n g  b u t  s t u p i d  a n d  h a d  a  j e we l  
embedded in his forehead. When he became tired, the 
skin o f his forehead sagged down and completely cov­
ered the jewel in his foriehead. W hen he put his hand up 
to feel the jewel, he could not feel it because the skin 
was completely covering it and so he thought that he 
had lost the jewel. He then went looking for the jewel, 
but couldn’ t find it anywhere. In the same way, it i s  
said that to obtain a definitive view, one has to look in 
the m ind itself and there is no point looking for it 
elsewhere.
When o n e  h a s  t he  r e a l i z a t i o n  of t he  mi nd,  i t  i s  s a i d  
there is no appearance, w hich means that w hen one 
looks at the m ind one can’t find that it exists as an actual 
thing. There is also the aspect o f clarity, which is the 
awareness of the absence of any true existence. This is 
an awareness that never ceases or is lost. Then there is 
the absence o f all elaborations or fabrications, which 
means there i s  no complication in one’ s  l i fe because one 
has realized that there is no actual thing. So one can say 
there isn’t a complication o f nonexistence because there 
is the aspect o f clarity. O ne can’t say that it is com pletelyThe P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsight

void, a vacuum, because there is the clarity of this awareness. Therefore, it has no existence nor is it non­existent, so it has no actual nature.The third Karmapa,.Ranjung Dorje, in hi s Mahdmudrd Prayer says th at the m in d  does n o t exist because it can n o t be seen by the buddhas. So the mind has no true existence as a thing because we cannot find it. Not only can’ t we find the mind, but the buddhas can’ t either. We may think that if the mind does not exist a s  a  thing, then it m ust be nonexistent. But the second line o f this verse says that m ind is not nonexistent because it is the basis of samsara and nirvana. So it is not nonexistent because of all the appearances of samsara and the way samsara arises in the mind. Therefore it can’ t be nonex­istent. Also the attainm ent o f nirvana, Buddhahood, the knowledge of the true nature and of the variety of phenomena develop from the mind. Therefore it is not nonexistent. The third line says there is no contradiction in saying that it is neither existent nor nonexistent. In fact this is not a contradiction. This is the M iddle Way, whi ch i s  f r e e  from t he ext remes of exi st ence and non­existence. So the meaning in this Mahdmudrd Prayer by the K arm apa is the same as has been given here. It says that this awareness is completely w ithout the mindful­ness o f thinking “There is this,” “There is that,” “This is g o o d ,” “ T his is b ad ,” and so on. T here isn’t any kind of ment al  act i vi t y or ment al  at t ent i on i n t hi nki ng.  Thi s is elim inated and the awareness is in a com pletely re­laxed state. We rest in m editation in this way and this is how Atisa describes the meditation and the way we should practice.Previously, being “well trained” was described as a characteristic of the accomplishment of samatha. TheVipasyana: Insight Meditation

The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insightaccomplishment of vipasyana is also the state of being “compl et el y t rai ned. ”  One ma y be  a b l e  t o medi t at e but  later not do so well because one loses one’s clarity, or one’ s  mind becomes dull, or one loses one’ s  wish to meditate. But when one has reached the state of the suppleness of being well trained, then the m ind natu­rally engages in vipasyana and this vipasyana brings clarity and understanding. So until one has accom­plished the suppleness of being well trained, one has not attained true vipasyana. The text says that the nature of this vipasyana and the way it is created has already been explained in the samatha section. In terms of the abhi- dharma one can say being “well trained” is a mental event and therefore all beings possess it all the time. But what di f f er s  between bei ngs i s  i t s  extent . Some bei ngs naturally engage in negative actions and some naturally engage in good actions. But since we haven’t been medi t at i ng from begi nni ngl ess t i me,  we  a r e  not “we l l  trained” in our meditation. We don’ t have this natural tendency, so we have to habituate ourselves to it as we did for samatha practice. The “well-trained” vipasyana will gradually develop by beginning with very little and then gradually increase. Samadhi, understanding, m ind­fulness, and awareness are all mental events that are naturally present, but must be increased. So first we develop samatha m editation and then we develop vipa­syana. The development o f the “well-trained” vipasyana is described in the Explanation of the View s ut r a ,  whi ch says that there are tw o kinds o f realization. T here is the realization o f the entire multiplicity of phenom ena, which i s  understanding the r el at i ve aspect  of phenom­ena. This is the understanding o f impermanence, the five aggregates, and the twelve links o f dependent orig­106

ination. To develop this we have to have a perfectly trained mind. Second, there is the realization of the true nature of phenomena and to have this, one also needs a perfectly trained mind. If one doesn’ t have a completely trained mind, then one will not have these two realiza­tions or genuine vipasyana. So the development o f the completely trained mind is the sign of the accomplish­ment  of vi pa s ya na.To summarize, there is the state o f being “well trained” in which one is able to do vipasyana meditation wi t hout  any di f f i cul t y or har dshi p;  i t  i s  ve r y pl eas ant  and easy to do. So when doing vipasyana meditation, there is no m ental or physical difficulty. This is the sign of t he accompl i shment  of vi pas yana medi t at i on.Vipasyana: Insight Meditation

Part Three
UNION [zung ’ jug)

5 The Uni on of SamathaAND VlPASYANÂOne can’ t achieve enlightenment with just sa­matha meditation. One a l s o  can’ t  achi eve en­lightenment w ith just vipasyanâ meditation. No one a c h i e v e s  wisdom of Buddhahood with just vipasyanâ meditation. What is necessary is to study samatha by itself, then study vipasyanâ by itself, and then practice the union of samatha and vipasyanâ to reach final enlightenment. The original text divides this chapter into three parts: the practice of the union of samatha and vipasyanâ, the timing of this union, and the different kinds o f samatha and vipasyanâ.The Practice of This UnionThe union of the stability of mind (samatha) a n d  o f  insight (vipasyana) o c c u r s  wh e n  t h e  mi n d  i s  a t  r e s t  a n d  still, not in the ordinary way, but at rest in the w isdom  of the dharmadhdtu. I n  t h e  s ü t r a  t r a d i t i o n  t h e r e  a r e  f o u r  different sets of instructions on how to do this, each of which i s  given by a  different Indian master. The instruc­tions vary, but they agree that one should practice the union of samatha and vipasyanâ. These four masters are Bhâvaviveka, Sântideva, Kamalasïla, and Chandrakïrti, who wer e a l l  Madhyamaka mast er s concer ned with ahi

thorough understanding of emptiness. There are two major schools in the Madhyamaka: the Svatantrikas and the Prasangikas. To simplify, the Svatantrika school says that on the level o f ultimate truth nothing has any true existence, whereas on the relative level things exist. So the Svatantrika school is concerned w ith concepts of existence and nonexistence. The Prasangika school, however, believes that things have no actual nature and phenomena are just appearances, that apart from these appearances they don’ t have any true nature. All things are just appearances. So the Prasangikas are not so concerned with concepts of existence and nonexistence.First, Bhavaviveka of the Prasangika school uses the method for  devel opi ng uni on,  of samat ha and vi pasyana,  which i s  that one first meditates on unpleasantness and love, etc. T his is described in the section on the rem edy for attachment where, for example, one meditates on love to overcom e clinging to anger. A person thus develops samatha meditation. Then one analyzes phe­nomena. In the analysis of external phenomena one develops an understanding of the inseparability of ap­pearance and emptiness. In the analysis of internal phe­nomena one gains understanding of the inseparability of emptiness and awareness of the percei ver.Second, Santideva in A G u i d e  t o  t h e  B o d h i s a t t v a ’ s  W a y of Li f e says that to develop samatha one needs to develop bodhichitta. T h e r e  i s  r e l a t i v e  a n d  a b s o l u t e  b o d h i c h i t t a  and in this practice one develops samatha through rela­tive bodhichitta by w ishing that all beings achieve hap­piness and be free from suffering. But beings do not know what causes suffering and so they remain in suffering. Therefore, one must develop the motivation to help all beings becom e free from  suffering. However,The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht
112

since one doesn’t have this ability, one practices dharm a because the dharma will teach one how to do this. One thinks that one is going to accomplish the goal o f helping all beings attain the state of Buddhahpod. This is the developm ent o f relative bodhichitta w ith  sam atha. After achieving the completely trained state of this samatha, one moves on to vipasyana. Through the development of vipasyana comes the realization of emp­tiness. This is the same as Bhavaviveka’s analysis o f outer phenomena and inner phenomena to develop the understanding of the inseparability of emptiness and appearance; and the inseparability of emptiness and awareness respectively.The third system, that of Kamalasil a, i s  widely prac­ticed and can be found in the second volume o f the Stages o f Meditation. One d e v e l o p s  s a ma t h a  t hr ough r e s t ­ing the m ind on an external object such as a statue of the Buddha, then on an internal object such as the breath and so on. This practice makes the mind still and calm. Having developed samatha this way, one then develops vipasyana by analyzing and examining that mind resting in samatha. O ne begins to realize that there is no m ind that can be identified and develops an understanding of the inseparability of awareness and emptiness. O ne rec­ognizes that when the mind is examined, there is noth­ing there that can be identified. O ne develops vipasyana meditation through the anal ysi s of the si x root mind poisons, as has been described in the tradition of Atlsa in the sam atha section.Chandrakirti, a  very great Madhyamaka master,  composed the text Entering the Middle Way, wh i c h  p r e ­sents m any kinds of reasoning and logical analyses of emptiness. Not only did he give reasons, but to elimi­The Union of Samatha & Vipasyana

nate his pupils’  clinging to phenomena he did a practical 
demonstration. At the entrance of most temples there i s 
a painting o f  the W heel o f E xistence.1 1  In the past arhats 
would go and visi t the si x realms, and when they 
returned, they would describe to others what it was like 
so that ordinary people could listen to these teachings 
and have these realms described to them. So the Buddha 
said that at the entrance to the temples there should be 
a painting o f  the beings o f  the six realm s for ord in ary  
people to see. Anyway, in the painting of the six realms 
there are depicted som e cows in the section o f the animal 
realm. O ne day Chandrakirti came up to the painting 
and began milking one of the cows in the painting. He 
was able to get enough milk for everyone to drink. He 
did this to demonstrate that whether it was a painting 
of a  cow or a n  a ct ua l  c ow,  nei t her  h a s  a ny t r ue r ea l i t y.  
So Chandrakirti was not only a great scholar, but also 
had great realization.
Chandrakirti’ s  method i s  di fferent  from the others.  
In this m ethod one listens to the teachings and then 
contemplates them so that one gains understanding of 
the true nature of things. By listening to and contem ­
plating the teachings, one develops the prajna or under­
standing of the true nature of all phenomena, which 
develops the view that comes from the analysis of the 
suchness of. things. O ne first develops this perfect un­
derstanding of the true nature of phenomena, and hav­
ing gained this, one develops samatha and vipasyana 
meditation. Thus they are practiced on the basi s of the 
view, the actual understanding of the nature of mind.
In these four systems there are slightly different in­
structions on how to develop samatha and vipasyana, 
but these are slight variations. They agree that we firstThe P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsight
114

need to stabilize the mind, then we will be able to develop the insight of vipasyanâ and that these two practices are not separate, but are a union. They agree that the practice of samatha is a causal condition result­ing in vipasyanâ, and that we practice the union of these two together. This means the m ind m ust be one- pointed and not distracted by other thoughts. This also means that we use the mind a s  the object of our medi­tation and do not think about som ething else. This one- pointedness comes when we are resting in meditation, not while we are analyzing phenomena.There i s  a  lama named Mendong Lama Sherab who is fro m  Lachi, a place w here M ilarepa m editated. T his is a very isolated place near the border o f N epal and Tibet. When the Chinese invaded, the border was closed and there was no passage through there, and so it became a very isolated place to which no one ever came. There was a  c a v e  there in which Lama Sherab meditated for three years. W hen I  was talking with Lama Sherab about his experiences, I  said, “You must have had a lot of real i zat i ons and experi ences there because there was nothing there to distract you.” Lama Sherab replied, “If you sit alone in a cave, your mind still becomes dis­tracted.” If you don’ t control your mind, your m ind will become distracted. It i s  important when meditating to have control over the m ind so that it w on’t becom e distracted. Therefore, the meditation has to be under firm control to protect it from arising thoughts.The text describes al l  the various kinds of samatha and vipasyanâ because it is a “T r e a s u r y ”  of Knowl e dge presenting all knowledge. The above practices are those that are taught in the sütra tradition. W hat is practiced in the vajrayâna tradition is the system o f KamalasilaThe Union of Samatha & Vipasyanâ

using an external, then internal object, etc. So samatha is generally developed by doing the practice o f  w atching one’ s  breath.Vipasyana i s  normally practiced using the different analyses of external objects and emptiness, internal emptiness and awareness, using the many different methods t hat ha v e  been descr i bed.  But  t he way fol l owed in the vajrayana tradition is the internal inseparability o f emptiness and awareness. W hen meditation is stable, the m ind rests in its natural stability. Som etim es thoughts arise and the mind is then in movement. One looks to see w hat is the nature o f the m ovem ent o f the mind. This i s  not using analyt ical reasoning and logic, but having a  direct experience of the nature of mind at rest and in movement. This is the usual m ethod followed for the development of vipasyana.One doesn’ t  h a v e  t o l ogi c a l l y a nal yz e  t he  mind t o f i nd out that it has no existence. One can just look at the mind and s e e  t hat  i t  i s  not t her e.  At  t he same ti me t her e is this process o f k n o w in g  o r awareness. T h e  w o rd  for “mind” in Tibetan i s  sem or  shepa, w h i c h  m e a n s  “ t h a t  which knows.”1 2  So there i s  this knowing, but if one tries to find out w hat it is that is knowing, one can’t find anything. The activity o f knowing is unceasing but one can’ t find anything that knows so one can say that this is selflessness. W hen there is no m ind, there is selflessness and there is emptiness so one can call this the inseparability o f clarity and emptiness. This selfless­ness, or egolessness, is something that we haven’t really thought o f throughout beginningless time that we have been in samsara because our attention has been turned outward. But turning inward, one sees this selflessness and the inseparability of clarity and emptiness. ThisThe Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insig ht
116

emptiness, however, is not emptiness meaning nothing whatsoever because there i s  the interdependence of phe­nomena, the awareness of what we experience, the forms we see, the sounds we hear, and so on.If our mind is not under control, then all the obscur­ations can arise in the mind. So all these things appear and their experience is something like watching a movie. There i s  nothing actually there in the theater, yet all these pictures, sounds, and emotions appear in our mind. So we have appearances arising in mind, but when we i nvest igate more cl osel y,  we s e e  that i t has no true existence, but is just the interdependence o f phe­nomena (such as the movie projector, the film, the screen, the speakers, etc.).The third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, described the nature of samatha and vipasyana in the vajrayana tradi­tion. In sam atha there are obvious and subtle waves o f thoughts that become naturally pacified. He said that these obvious and subtle thoughts becom e stilled; they are like the sea. There are sometimes large and some­times small waves on the sea. W hen these waves cease, then the sea is completely still w ithout movement. In the same way, one has sometimes subtle and sometimes obvious thoughts. If these become completely pacified, the m ind becomes totally still, calm, and unm oving like a calm  sea. Even w hen the sea is com pletely still, there can be some pollution, so one needs to have very pure and clear water running into the sea for it to be com­pletely pure. Likewise, even though the mind has been stilled, there can still be the defect o f dullness o f the mind. So correct samatha occurs when the defect of dullness is removed so that there is a state of calm and stability and also a state o f clarity.The Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
117

Rangjung Dorje also describes vipasyana a s  looking again and again at something that cannot be seen. So the nature o f m ind cannot be examined or analyzed. He says that one looks at the nature o f m ind again and again and nothing with true existence can be found. By looking at this and seeing the true nature o f the mind, one becomes free of doubt and uncertainty of what the mi nd i s  l i k e .  I ns t ead one de ve l ops  a  cert ai nt y through seeing the nature of the mind, and this is vipasyana meditation.To develop samatha and vipasyana you have to have diligence and apply yourself to meditation without go­ing from  one m ethod to another. But diligence alone is not enough without having the actual practice and es­sential instructions such as in guru yoga. In this practice you supplicate the guru and in this way you develop devotion to the guru. Following this supplication and development of faith and devotion to the guru, light beams of white, red, and blue come from the guru (who is visualized in fro n t o f  you) and m erg e into yourself; thus you receive the blessing from  the guru. W hen that occurs, a transformation in meditation can occur. If you hadn’ t been able to develop the insight of vipasyana meditation, then suddenly through guru yoga you can develop this meditation. If you have had the experience of samatha and vipasyana, guru yoga can help increase the intensity o f this experience. The purifications o f your bad karma and the accumulation of merit will also increase your samatha and vipasyana. The elimination of your bad karma and obscurations will al so remove obstacles to your samatha and vipasyana. Therefore, you do the practice of Vajrasattva for the purification of your bad karma and obscurations and do the practice ofThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
118

mandala offering t o help your experience and r eal i za­
tion. The four prelim inary practices are very im portant 
and the purpose of doing these practices is to increase 
your samatha and vipasyanâ. You need diligence to 
practice meditation, but diligence by itself is not 
enough, so you get help from the practice of the prelim­
inaries. The first prelim inary, prostrations, is taking 
refuge in the three jewels (of Buddha, dharma, and 
sarigha) and the development o f bodhichitta, which 
causes you to enter on the genuine path, and the other 
three preliminaries increase the development o f samatha 
and vipasyanâ. The primary cause for the development 
of samatha and vi pasyanâ i s  your own di l i gence and t he 
necessary conditions are the preliminary practices. Hav­
ing both o f these enables you to develop the union of 
samatha and vipasyanâ.
The Time of the Union
The text s a ys  that there are two kinds of union: samatha 
and vipasyanâ with a reference point and samatha and 
vipasyanâ without a reference point. Samatha with a 
reference point means that one’ s m ind is focused on 
something like a statue of the Buddha or the breath. 
Vipasyanâ with a reference point means that one analyt­
ically exam ines and differentiates between phenom ena. 
When t hat  vi pas yanâ’ s  r e a l i z a t i on a r i s e s  t oget her  wi t h 
nonconceptual samatha, there is the union of the two. 
Though t here i s  samatha and vi pasyanâ t hat  depends on 
a reference point, the m ain k in d  o f sam atha and vipasy­
anâ is nonconceptual samatha and vipasyanâ that is 
wi t hout  a  r e f e r e nc e  poi nt .  Thi s ki nd of s amat ha medi ­

119

the large and subtle waves becom ing stilled. This is the state where one rests in the nature o f the m ind w ithout any concepts. It is the state of stability. The vipasyana is seeing that the m in d  does n o t have any reality o r true existence. The presence of this state of peace and the realization of the nature of the m ind is the union of samatha and vipasyana. Samatha is an aid to the vipa­syana and the vipasyana is an aid to the samatha. So it is called the un io n  o f  sam atha and vipasyana.Nonconceptual samatha meditation i s  the mind just resting in its natural state. Nonconceptual vipasyana is understanding the inseparability of the appearances and emptiness of external phenomena and understanding the inseparability of the awareness and emptiness o f the internal perceiver. Both are necessary in order to have the nonconceptual samatha and vipasyana united as a single identity. So one can practice samatha alone or one can practice vipasyana alone but when they are practiced together they should be practiced in union. The union means that samatha and vipasyana are not coexisting with each other, but instead it is impossible to differentiate between them. So if there’s nonconcep­tual samatha, then there will be nonconceptual vipa­syana, or if there is nonconceptual vipasyana, then there will be nonconceptual samatha.The union of samatha and vipasyana i s  explained clearly by Kamalasila in the first volume o f the Stages o f Meditation. H e  s a y s  t h a t  w h e n  p r a c t i c i n g  m e d i t a t i o n  o n e  sees the absence o f the essence o f phenom ena. Being a Madhyamaka e xpl a na t i on,  t h e  s t at ement  me a n s  t hat  o ne  sees the em ptiness o f phenom ena, w hich m eans seeing the true nature o f phenom ena exactly as it is. This is described by the Buddha as being beyond words andThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
120

thoughts. Beyond words means that the state com ­pletely transcends the ability to be described by words. Being beyond thoughts means one cannot analyze it conceptually by thinking that it exists, or doesn’ t exist, or whatever. One also cannot say that phenomena are nonexistent because there is the awareness of mind. This direct insight into the clarity and the absence of any true essence is vipasyana— true insight.What  then i s  t he samat ha a s pe c t ?  Thi s i s  t he abs ence of dul l ness or agit at i on i n medi t at i on.  There i s  a l s o t he absence of the three obstacles of aggression and doubt and regret, which can hinder the development of a stable meditative state. If one has regret, one thinks, “Oh, I  wish such and such a  thing had happened” or “This thing didn’t turn out right,” which disrupts meditation. If one has doubt, one thinks, “Is this true or isn’ t it?” and this uncertainty disrupts meditation. If one has aggression, one feels anger toward someone and this will disrupt meditation. So in meditation one is free from dullness and agitation and the three obstacles of regret, doubt, and aggression; so there is no deliberate activity. “No deliberate activity” means that one rests in the natural state of concentration due to familiariza­tion. W ith this familiarization one doesn’t need to make a d elib erate effo rt to stay in m e d ita tio n . T h e  te x t says that w hen one is able to see the actual nature of medita­tion and phenomena and be free from  the defects of agitation and dullness, etc., and when one can rest effortlessly in meditation free from any deliberate ac­tion, then one has achieved the union of samatha and vipasyana.The way of practicing the union of samatha and vipasyana meditation was described by Milarepa in hisThe Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
121

songs, particularly the song to Nyim a Paldar Bum. Paldar Bum had a lot of faith and was very skilled in her dharma practice. She was also very good at asking sharp and intelligent questions. Milarepa met her one time when he was givi ng t eachi ngs t o a  number of peopl e.  She felt great faith in Milarepa and invited him  into her home. She told him that she was living in samsara and during the day she was busy preparing food and cloth­ing and in the evening she slept. But she wanted to practice the dharma and asked Milarepa what practice she could do that would lead her to attain Buddhahood.Milarepa then sang her a  spiritual song (doha) i n  which he used a  number of metaphors and exampl es. When I  wa s  young my t e a c he r  t ol d me  t he st or y of Milarepa l eavi ng hi s  homeland, having hi s house de­stroyed, and later returning to his hom e to see the ruins.I h e a r d  th e  s o n g  in  w h i c h  M i l a r e p a  d e s c r i b e d  h is  r u i n e d  house as a lion’ s  upper jaw and a neighboring house as being like a donkey’ s  ears. When I heard this song as a child, I thought it was some kind o f m etaphor. Later when I  returned t o Tibet and s aw a l l  the ruined build­ings, I thought, “This really does look like a lion’s jaw  and that’ s like a donkey’ s ears with bits of the buildings fallen dow n and pieces sticking u p .” M ilarepa’s m eta­phor perfectly described what the ruins looked like.Returning to our story, Milarepa gave Paldar Bum a  teaching in a song in which he used four m etaphors or symbols. He first said to her, “Look at the sky. The sky has no center that you can point to and you can’t determine where the edge of the sky is. In that same way rest in your mind without there being a center or lim it.” Second, he said, “Look at the mountain. It is completely stable and unmoving. In that way your mindThe Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insight

should be firm and steady.” Third, he said, “Look at the sun and moon. They don’ t fluctuate in brightness. They stay completely clear with the same intensity a l l  the time. In that way your m ind’ s clarity should not fluctuate.” And fourth, he said, “Look at a great lake that has no waves and is completely calm and still. In that way your m ind should be calm and still.” Milarepa did not mean that we should actually meditate on a mount ai n,  s un,  l a ke,  or t he s ky,  but t hes e wer e met a­phors for nonconceptual meditation we should have. Then Milarepa told Paldar Bum to meditate without concepts, which is the samatha aspect. Looking at the essence of the absence o f thoughts is the vipasyana aspect. So he instructed her to meditate with the union of samatha and vipasyana by telling her to meditate wi t hout  t hought s.  T o  medi t at e wit hout  t hought s i s  t he fifth instruction in this song.Nyima Pal dar  Bum meditated and came back t o Mi l arepa with quest i ons about  t he song gi ven her .  S h e  said that w hen she looked at the sky, she was able to meditate like the sky in a  completely rel axed st at e.  But clouds appeared in the sky, and what should she do about the clouds? She said that she was able to meditate on the mountains. But when doing this, she could see plants and trees growing on the mountains, and what should she do about them? She said that she was able to meditate l i ke the sun and moon, but sometimes the sun and m oon were eclipsed, and what should she do about the eclipse? She said she was able to meditate on a lake, but sometimes waves would appear, and what should she do about the waves?

but when she did this thoughts would arise, and how 
could she meditate on these thoughts?
Milarepa repl ied that i t  was very good that she could 
meditate l i ke the sky with the absence of any center or 
limit. W hen clouds appeared, one should not see them  
as being any different from  the sky because they are just 
a m anifestation o f  the sky. If one can realize and u n d er­
stand that the nature of these clouds is the sky, they will 
naturally disappear. If one is able to meditate on the 
mountain, that i s  good.  The pl ant s and t r ees growing 
on the mountain are not any different from the moun­
tain; they are sim ply manifestations o f the m ountain. If 
one is able to meditate on the sun and moon, that is 
good and an eclipse of the sun or moon is nothing other 
than the nature of the sun and moon. If one is able to 
meditate on a  great l ake,  wave s  are likely to occur, 
which i s  just the movement of the lake and therefore 
only a manifestation of the lake because there are no 
waves that are not a part of the lake. Then Milarepa said 
that if one is able to meditate on the mind, then som e­
times thoughts will appear. But these thoughts are just 
movements occurring in the mind. They are nothing 
other than the mind, a  manifestation of the mind. When 
one does not understand the nature of the thoughts, 
they are like waves upon the lake, but still part o f the 
lake. W hen one understands the nature o f thoughts and 
that they do not have any true essence, they will natu­
rally be pacified. So one needs to understand that 
thoughts are not separate from  the mind.
In this way M ilarepa taught the union o f samatha and 
vipasyana. Resting without thoughts is samatha medi­
tation and seeing that these thoughts are nothingThe P racti ce  of T ranqui lli ty  &  I nsight

other than a  manifestation of the mind i s  vipasyana 
meditation.
The Result of the Union
The union of samatha and vipasyana i s  greater than 
achieving either samatha or vipasyana, and this result is 
called genuine samadhi. W hen one has genuine sama- 
dhi, the meditative and postmeditative periods are 
blended. So one practices meditation, then one arises 
from the meditation session and through familiarization 
wi t h medi t at i on,  one c a n  cont i nue one’ s  d a i l y  a c t i v i t i e s  
while resting in this state of meditation. So this blending 
of meditation and postmeditation i s  genui ne samadhi — 
the union o f samatha and vipasyana.
The great translator Marpa brought teachings on 
meditation from Indi a to Tibet. Marpa had two princi­
pal teachers— Naropa and Maitripa. From Naropa he 
learned the path o f m ethods in which there are various 
methods t o be pract i ced t o gai n r eal i zat i on.  But  Maitrl- 
pa’ s  teaching emphasizes direct meditation, which i s  
also very im portant. This teaching can be found in the 
Commentary on the Ten Suchnesses.  I n  t h i s  t e x t  h e  s a i d  
that genuine samadhi will accomplish a result. This 
means that the union of samatha and vipasyana i s  the 
greatest thing one can achieve. There is nothing higher 
than this because w hat needs to be realized has been 
realized and w hat needs to be eliminated has been 
eliminated. The samadhi with the union of samatha and 
vipasyana fully developed will free one from the bond­
age of samsara so one attains a state of nonabiding 
nirvana, which is Buddhahood.
Some people are very fond of studying the dharmaThe Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
125

and practicing meditation, but are not interested in achieving Buddhahood. They believe Buddhahood is opposed to worldliness and that to achieve Buddhahood is to som ehow  depart from  this w orld and go to som e buddha-realm or paradise. But achieving Buddhahood is n o t that at all. T h e T ibetan w ord for “ B u d d h a” is sang-gye; sang means “clear,” and^ye means “increased” or “developed.” The main syllable of this word is gye, “developed,”  but the translat ors wanted to make the meaning of the Buddha r eal l y c l ea r ,  s o they added the first syllable, sang. T h r o u g h  t h i s  s a m a d h i  of  t h e  u n i o n  of samat ha and vi pasyana one i s  a bl e t o remove a l l  t he faults o f the klesas and develop complete understanding of the nature of phenomena. One therefore becomes clear o f these defects, which is the meaning o f the syllable sang. O n c e  a l l  t h e  k l e s a s  h a v e  b e e n  e l i m i n a t e d ,  all the w isdom  and positive qualities o f the B uddha develop and this is the meaning of the syllable gye. Buddhahood isn’ t  the act  of going to a  pure realm, but rather being in the ordinary world with the achievement of t he union of samatha and vi pasyana.The sutra of the Explanation of the View s a y s  t h a t  through samatha and vipasyana one becomes free o f the bondage of the negative propensities. We are now in the human realm, which i s one of the three higher realms (the god realm, jealous god realm, and hum an realm), but if the mind poisons are present this will result in accumulating negative karma, and accumulating nega­tive karm a will result in being reborn in one o f the lower realms (the animal realm, hungry ghost realm, and hell realm). When one becomes free of the klesas, one also becomes free from the bondage of conceptual designations. For the ordinary person, the mind graspsThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
126

at things and is so attached to phenomena that it doesn’ t 
see their true nature. So the bondage o f negative pro­
pensities prevents the development of meditation, the 
elimination of the klesas, the rebirth in a higher realm, 
and the attainment of liberation. The bondage of nega­
tive propensities and the bondage o f conceptual charac­
teristics (described in the Explanation of the View  s ut r a )  
are the obscurations of the klesas and the obscurations 
of knowl edge.  When t hes e obscurat i ons a r e  r emoved,  
all the positive, qualities such as w isdom , clairvoyance, 
and miraculous powers naturally appear. This is similar 
to when the clouds move away from  in front o f the sun 
so that the sun shines in its full brilliance w ithout 
anything new having to be created. In the same way, 
clearing away all the obscurations allows all the positive 
qualities to shine in their brilliance.
In brief, we sit in m editation and focus our m ind 
upon the external inseparability of appearance and emp­
tiness and the internal inseparability o f awareness and 
emptiness. Then if we allow our mind to become in­
volved in many different thoughts in the postmeditation 
state, we will not be able to make any progress in our 
meditation. So we need t o h a v e  mindfulness and aware­
ness in the postmeditation state. In the beginning this is 
difficult, but whatever we are doing we should use 
mindfulness to control our awareness s o that a  natural 
control of our actions is developed. When we are work­
ing, eating, going somewhere, or talking w ith som e­
one, we cultivate this natural self-control of mindfulness 
and awareness. The text says that in postmeditation we 
see all phenom ena as being illusory. This means that in 
postmeditation we retain whatever reality and under­
standing we have gained in our meditation and see allThe Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
127

phenomena as illusion so that we won’ t become attached to phenomena. This is w hat we should do in the post- meditative state.There are three kinds of behavior that one should practice in the postmeditative state: (i) making offerings to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, (2) developing com ­passion toward beings, and (3) dedicating all of one’ s  good actions and karma. One makes offerings to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas not because offerings make them happy and once happy they will help us. O ne makes offerings because the dharma i s  very important and the practice of dharma is special. The Buddha is the one who taught the dharma and the bodhisattvas are special beings w ho have been able to practice the dharm a without obs t a c l e s .  Maki ng of f er i ngs  t o t hes e s p e c i a l  beings increases one’ s own motivation to practice the dharma and to meditate. Without the development of genuine meditation one will remain in samsara and experience suffering, being continuously reborn. But if one has genuine meditation one will attain liberation. One must  d e v e l o p  compas s i on t owar d ot her  bei ngs  because they are suffering. They are suffering because they haven’ t been able to develop genuine meditation. So by m aking an offering to the Buddhas and bodhisatt­vas and developing compassion toward beings, this be­comes part o f one’ s own aspiration and interest in the development of samadhi. Through the development of one’ s  samadhi, one will be able to help other beings.One a l s o  makes  a  va s t  de di cat i on,  whi ch means  ded­icating to all beings whatever realization and experience one has acquired from one’ s  meditation or whatever good karma one has accumulated.1 3  Does this mean that when one does  a  good act i on,  t hen one can g i v e  i t  t oThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
128

someone else? No, because when one does a good deed, one receives the result of that action and can’ t give one’ s  good karma to others. But there is a dedication prayer dedicating one’ s actions to others, so isn’ t it rather pointless? Let us take an example. Say we wanted a flower to grow on this table before us. No m atter how hard we pray, no flower will grow there. To have a flower grow  on the table, we m ust get a flower pot, soil, water, and the proper seed. In the same Wa y ,  by making dedication prayers, we develop a strong motivation to help others, then through the good karma that we accumulate from this, we will be able to help beings. So if we dedicate our good actions, they will never be wasted because eventually our wish will be fulfilled. That i s  why we should do a  vas t  dedi cati on t o a l l  bei ngs in our postm editation.Different Kinds of SamathaThe next section of the Treasury o f Knowledge is a review of t he di f f er ent  ki nds  of samat ha and vi pa s ya na.  Begi n­ning with samatha, there is the samatha of the general yanas and then there is the samatha specific to the vajarayana. Samatha of the sutra method consists of samatha meditation on the nine kinds of unpleasantness as a rem edy for desire, on love and com passion as a remedy for anger, and on the breath as a remedy for too m any thoughts.The samatha of the vajrayana uses a  number of meth­ods. The vajrayana is often better because it has many different kinds of methods that make the path much easier to practice. Thus, there are a variety of methods such as the meditation oh love in which one developsThe Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
129

the wish that beings have happiness. If beings are w ith­out happiness, one wishes that they can become happy and can have the conditions that bring happiness. This is the m editation on love, w hich is directed at all beings. Through t hi s meditation on l o v e  one devel ops and i n­creases one’s samatha meditation, which itself increases one’ s  meditation on love. Then one meditates on those who a r e suf f er i ng and wi shes t hat  t hey be f r e e  from suffering and the causes of suffering. This meditation on compassion increases one’ s  meditation, which in­creases one’ s compassion. So in this way, developing love and com passion increases the stability and stillness of one’ s  mind.The method for developing l ove and compassion i s  to first meditate on the sameness o f oneself and others. One t hi nks t hat  ever yt hi ng one exper i ences that i s  pl ea­surable is what other beings also like. If one experiences things one does not like, it is the same for other beings. In this way one contemplates and realizes the sameness of onesel f and ot hers.  Next one medi t at es on cheri shi ng others more than oneself. There are actions one does for oneself. If one does this for other beings instead of acting just for oneself, it is of much greater benefit. So others are seen as more important than oneself. Finally, there is the practice of exchanging oneself for others, known as sending and taking (Tib. tonglen). T h r o u g h  this practice one’s m ind poisons becom e less and one’s love and com passion for others increase, and the stabil­ity of one’ s m ind increases.There i s  also the vajrayana practice of breathing used within the Kagyi i tradition cal l ed gentle breathing i n three phases. In norm al breathing, there is an in-breath and an out-breath. In this practice of breathing oneThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
130

counts the inhalation and exhalation of the breath to develop stability of mind. The Treasury o f Knowledge mentions t he in-breath, out-breath, and t he pause be­tween these w hen the breath remains in the body. This is G a m p o p a ’s “ gentle breath practice in three stag es.” This method i s  not like “vase breathing,” which is . a  stronger and more intense method, too strong for the beginner. In Gampopa’ s  method first there is the in­breath, then the breath is held at the abdomen for a while, and then there i s  the out-breath, making three different stages. The reason for holding the breath is that norm al breathing is done at the level o f the m outh and the breath does not spread throughout the body. However, if one holds the breath, then the air will spread throughout the body. If one holds the breath at the level of t he ches t ,  one does  not get  t he a i r  through t he body and it feels uncomfortable. If one holds the breath below the area o f the navel, the air will spread throughout the body.If one meditates just on inhalation and exhalation, it is possible to becom e distracted and forget o n e’s m ed i­tation. If one’s m editation is on inhalation, holding the breath, and exhalation, then if one loses one’ s mindful­ness one will forget to hold the breath and it will be obvious that one has lost one’ s  awareness. So doing breathing in three stages is more beneficial to develop stability of mind than just meditating on the in- and out-breath.The first method speci fi c to the vajrayana i s  the met hod c a l l e d  i ndi vi dual  wi t hdr awal  ( S k t .  prdtyahdra, Tib. sordu), w h i c h  i n v o l v e s  c u t t i n g  t h r o u g h  t h e  o b j e c t s  of mi nd.  There a r e  s i x  obs t a c l es  t hat  a r e  t he pr i nci pal  obstacles to samatha meditation. These are dullness,The Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
131

agitation, aggression, regret, uncertainty, and attach­ment. One has to recognize each of these obstacles individually. In meditation one can investigate each of these. O ne m ight think, for example, “I’m  feeling regret. This is an obstacle so I have to apply the remedy to it.” It is easier to take one particular kind o f thought or obstacle and deal with that, rather than deal with all thoughts as they come up. This is called the individual withdrawal because the “individual” refers to the indi­vidual obstacles that are cut through.The second samatha practice of the vajrayana i s  call ed the em pty structure o f channels (nadis). In the b o d y  there are three principal channels— the central channel (avaduti), t h e  l e f t  c h a n n e l  (lolana), and the rig h t channel (:rasana). In this practice one m editates on these three channels and the chakras.The third method i s  the practice of prana yoga or the practice of the vayus (subtle airs in the body). O ne’ s  meditation i s  on the subt l e channel s and one medi t at es on the subtle airs that flow through the channels. There are different yogas and practices for these subtle airs. There i s  a  practice for bringing long life and there’ s  a  practice for making the body feel blissful and there is the practice for increasing wisdom , and so on. Then there is the practice of the bindus or subtle drops where one makes the bindus permeate the body, creating physical bliss and the experience of the union of bliss and emptiness.In the vajrayana teachings there is also the practice of medi t at i on on t he yidam de i t i e s .  Somet i mes one imag­ines the yidam  above one’s head and som etim es one imagines oneself as the yidam deity. Sometimes to make one’ s  meditation on the deity clearer, one meditates onThe Practi ce of Tran qu i lli ty &  Insight
132

letters and syllables o f a m antra. They are at times imagined as very large and sometimes very small, but all this is in order to create stability o f mind. T hrough this visualization or development phase o f practice one is able to elim inate the im p u re  appearances o f  p h e n o m ­ena and develop pure appearances. By inviting the wis­dom deities one receives the blessing. The visualization practice is a special method for developing a stability of mind t hat  i s  not t oo t i ght  or t oo l oos e.  One just r es t s  i n the natural state of the mind. In general, the visualiza­tion (Tib. kyerim) s t a g e  of t h e  p r a c t i c e s  a c t  a s  me t hods  for developing samatha meditation. Some people do visualization practices with the hope of getting a very clear visualization. W hen this does not happen, they become disappointed and do not like to do the practice. It is n o t the purpose o f the visualization to get a clear visualization, but to meditate on the nature of the deity so one can develop its pure appearances and create stability of mind. W hen one becomes distracted, the deity will be forgotten and one will readily notice it. Therefore, visualization i s  a  special means to develop stability o f mind and awareness.Sometimes when we become tired of visualizing a  deity or meditating on our breath, we can then do mantra reci t at i on pr act i ce.  Reci t i ng mant ras can be done with a  sound or without a  sound.  When we  r eci t e a  mant ra wit hout  a  sound,  we  do i t  qui et l y s o  t hat  no one can hear it. It is traditionally described as reciting the mant ra “s o  t hat  t he sound onl y r e a c he s  one’ s  col l ar. ”  When r ec i t i ng t he  mant r a we  s houl d be  a wa r e  of e a c h  syllable of the m antra so the mind is aware of each of these syllables. If the m antra is om mani peme hung we don’ t just recite it without being aware of it, butThe Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
133

recite it very quietly, so that others can barely hear it, keeping the mind aware of the sound of the mantra without di st r act i on.  There i s  a l s o  t he ment al  r eci t at i on of t he mantra i n which we do not use our v o i c e .  W e  count the mantras with our mala and r e c i t e  t he mant r a fully in our mind. We usually do one hundred of these and there is no possibility of being distracted by men­tally reciting the m antra because we are counting on the mala. D o i n g  t h i s  m a k e s  o u r  m i n d  s t a b l e  a n d  i t  a l s o  makes the mind’ s  orientation to the mantra become much c l e a r e r .Then there i s  mantra recitation call ed recitation with cessation. The mental recitation is joined to the breath­ing so that it is not just a mental recitation. We recite one part of the mantra while inhaling, one part while holding the breath, and one part while exhaling. This does not involve actual sound. For example, with the Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) mantra, on the in­breath we recite om ah hung and with the held breath we recite bendza guru pema and with the out-breath siddhi hung. The reason t hi s i s  cal l ed recitation with cessation is that this m ethod stops all thoughts.There are the above methods that use a  reference point, and there is also the method of direct or naked recognition of the m ind’ s  nature. All these methods are means to develop supreme wisdom. There are many methods t o gai n t hi s wisdom and t he methods ar e gi ven in accordance w ith the individual’s capabilities and na­ture. Some m ethods are for individuals w ith strong devotion, some are for those with strong understanding, and so on, so one doesn’ t do every method of samatha and vipasyana described, but the one that is suitable to one’ s  capacity and nature.The Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insight
134

What  i s  d e v e l o p e d  by a l l  t h e  p r a c t i c e s  of s a ma t ha  i s  stability of mind. W ith this stability one can develop vipasyana. If the mind is stable and resting in its natural state, one can use sharp understanding to analyze and investigate the texts or understand the meaning o f the words of the texts. So with stability of mind, one can examine and understand whatever one focuses one’ s  mind on,  s o  t hat  one’ s  samat ha pr act i ce becomes vi pa­syana practice.Sometimes analytical meditation is done by itself and sometimes nonanalytic meditation is done alone. Some­times they are done alternately. If done correctly, either met hod c an l e a d  t o t he devel opment  of samat ha and vipasyana. In terms of a goal they are the same; in terms' of a  pat h,  however ,  t here i s  a  di f f er ence between them.Levels and Results of MeditationThe text gi ves  an added explanation of the three differ­ent levels of meditation (dhyana). T h e first level is o f ordinary beings and this is called literally the experience of a n  i mmat ur e  b e i n g . I n  t e r ms  of  p r a c t i c e ,  t h e  p e r s o n  a t  this level is able to recognize to a certain extent w hen a distraction occurs and is able to return to meditation. Through doing t hi s ,  vari ous experi ences of meditation occur. The second stage is the level of the bodhisattva and this is called the level of meditation that differentiates meanings. I n  t h i s  m e d i t a t i v e  s t a t e  t h e r e  i s  a  v e r y  c l e a r  understanding of the nature of phenomena such as dependent origination, the illusory nature of phenom­ena, and so on and w isdom  develops m ore and more. The third state i s  the ultimate stage o f a Buddha i n which the nature o f phenom ena is seen; this is know n as theThe Union of Samatha & Vipasyana
135

primordial nature of peace. It is not a new wisdom, but a realization that com es com pletely effortlessly. So these are the three kinds o f m editation in relation to “ thatness, the true nature o f phenom ena.”The Treasury o f Knowledge does not discuss the expe­riences that com e from  m editation in particular, so I shall offer m y own thoughts on this topic as a sum m ary.The result of practicing meditation i s  realization and experience. Meditation experiences are temporary and come rather quickly. Realization, however, is attained through the gradual process of meditation and is lasting. One h a s  t o work on at t ai ni ng r eal i zat i on,  wher eas one should have no attachment to the experience of medita­tion whether good or bad. If one has a good experience in m editation, one should think that it is just an appear­ance or manifestation of the m ind and have no joy that one has had it. If one does develop an attachment to meditational experiences, one will devel op pride, which will cause further obstacles to one’ s  meditation. If one has a bad experience, one should not be frightened because it also is just an appearance of mind.The different experiences of meditation are due to the differences of the subtle channels. Some people get experiences right away, others don’t get any particular meditational experience until their meditation becomes firm and stable. There is no reason to feel happy that one has had a good experience or think that one is not ) g e t t i n g  a n y w h e r e  b e c a u s e  o n e  h a s  h a d  n o  e x p e r i e n c e s .  There i s  also no reason to think that one has a  problem because one is having different experiences in medita­tion, or that one does not have stable m editation because one is having few or no experiences. There is no reason to be happy or sad because experiences in m editationThe Practice of Tranquillity & I n s i g h t
136

are just a creation of the m ind due to different kinds of channels and have nothing to do with meditation.There are three kinds of meditation experiences— bliss, clarity, and the absence o f thoughts. The experi­ence of bliss occurs when one is meditating and feels happy and has a  feeling of physical bliss. If this occurs, one should have no attachment to it or take it as a sign of good meditation. Inst ead one should just ignore i t  and keep on with the meditation. There is a very clear awareness in which one sees everything and knows everything with the experience of clarity and this is also just a fabrication of mind. O ne should not think that this is genuine m editation but should have no attach­ment  or i nvol vement  i n t h i s  exper i ence of c l a r i t y .  When one experiences the absence of thought, one may think that one has attained a state o f complete stability in meditation. But one shouldn’ t  stop there,  one should just continue unceasingly with one’ s practice of medi­tation.When one i s  pr act i ci ng t he  dharma and t her e a r e  no great obstacles, it is easy to develop internal obstacles to one’ s  practice. This occurs because one begins to think that one has a great practice and feels very proud. This pride itself is a great obstacle to one’ s  dharma practice and meditation. It is said in Tibet that “into the solid ball of pride the water of positive qualities cannot be poured.” This means that when one becomes proud, one is like a solid lump and this becomes an obstacle. Instead one should have humility, faith, and devotion to the dharma. Because pride is such a great obstacle, one should examine oneself to see if pride is there or not.When Gampopa f i r s t  hear d t he  name “Mi l ar epa, ”  he  felt great faith in M ilarepa and went to find him .

kept asking the way until he finally got very close to where Milarepa was st ayi ng.  The pupils of Milarepa came out to meet him, and one of his students, a woman, sai d she would take him to her house to st ay the night and the next day she would take him  to see Mi l arepa.  Sh e  sai d t hat s he had s een Mi l arepa that da y and Milarepa had told her that there would be a m onk confing from central Tibet who had good qualities and would be a  great pupil of hi s.  Milarepa had al so sai d that the one w ho introduced this m onk to M ilarepa would be very fortunate and would not be reborn in the lower realms. After hearing this, G am popa thought, “Oh, if Milarepa i s  a  great siddha,  he has great knowl­edge. From the way he talked I am very fortunate and will not have much difficulty with dharma practice.” Gampopa became s o proud t hat Mi l arepa sent  down a  pupil each day for two weeks saying, “D on’ t be upset, but you can’ t come to see Milarepa yet.” In this way, Gampopa’ s  pr i de wa s  el i mi nat ed.  So  we  s e e  how pr i de can be an obstacle to dharm a practice.Some individuals who practice in a very dark retreat (bardo r e t r e a t )  w i l l  s e e  a l l  s o r t s  o f  l i g h t s  a n d  w i l l  f e e l  their bodies shaking and so on during meditations. These are experiences that one must not become at­tached to because they are just appearances o f the mind. Good or bad, one just continues with one’ s  meditation wi t hout  becomi ng i nvol ve d wi t h t hem.  Si n c e  dr eams are expressions of the mind, the meditation will create all kinds o f dream s. B ut there is no need to becom e attached to a good dream or fixated upon a bad dream. For example, when Gampopa went to see Milarepa to tell him  about his various dream s, M ilarepa replied, “Abu were lying to me when you came and said thatThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht

you had done a lot of practice. If you had done a  lot of practice, you wouldn’t have all this attachment to dreams.”If one has a dream and thinks something good is going to happen but nothing actually happens in one’ s  practice, then one will lose the determination to prac­tice. Similarly, if one experiences bliss and clarity in one’ s  meditation and thinks, “Oh, I  have a  very good medi t at i on”  and becomes at t ached t o i t ,  but  t he next  time one does not experience it, one m ight then think, “Oh,  I  h a v e  l os t  my medi t at i on. ”  S o  one  shoul d not  b e  attached to these experiences, but realize that these experiences do not change the essence of one’ s medita­tion. Even if one doesn’t experience anything, one does not change one’ s  meditation but just practices with that state of m ind in meditation.Posture of the body is very important in meditation. For example, when Gampopa was practicing, he had the experience o f the whole valley outside his cave becoming filled with smoke. When the smoke cleared, he became very uncomfortable because he heard great shouting. He thought that he must have become afflicted by some kind of demon or spirit. When he asked Mi l arepa about  i t ,  Mi l ar epa r epl i ed t hat  hi s  post ure was  not correct and this was tightening his inner channels, which then caused t hese experi ences.  So  the s e ven a s ­pects of the Vairocana posture or the five aspects of dhyana posture are important. It is not essential to have one’ s  legs in the vajra posture, but it i s very important to have one’s body sitting very straight. This sitting up straight is important whether one is reciting a mantra, doing a visualization, or practicing any other kind of meditation.

ness, awareness, and attentiveness to one’s meditation practice and the vayus will flow correctly in the subtle channels.To m editate we need to have the great diligence called armor-like diligence. It is like armor because when we wear armor, we ' have great courage. The reason we need this diligence is1  because the vajrayana teaches how  to attain Buddhahood in one lifetime, and when people hear this they have the expectation of reaching the goal very quickly. W hen they don’ t get great results quickly, they then lose confidence. So we need to have great diligence w ithout the expectation of achieving quick results because first we have to eliminate all the m ind poisons to which we have become habituated through­out beginningless samsara. Then we have to attain all the qualities, w isdom , and omniscience o f the Buddha. In order to attain these positive qualities and eliminate all the negative m ind poisons, we need great diligence. So we m ust not think that there will be quick results to our practice. We can achieve Buddhahood within one lifetime in the vajrayana, but we need a great deal o f diligence^ like that o f Milarepa, which is difficult for most peopl e t o must er.We m ight think that we will achieve Buddhahood if we have great diligence like Milarepa and that nothing will happen by doing just a  little bit each day. We might think, “I don’t have M ilarepa’ s diligence, so it is im pos­sible for me to achieve any results.” We shouldn’t believe that w ithout great diligence it w on’t m ake any differ­ence if we practice dharma or not. The Buddha said that doing any meditation i s  very good. For example, he said that even if someone just has the thought o f where he is going to go and what he is going to do, evenThe Practi ce of Tranqui lli ty &  Insig ht

though he has not yet arrived there or done anything, it will bring a beneficial result. Similarly, a  result will come from just thinking of future practice. Generally speaking, just taking a couple of steps to where one is going to meditate has no benefit in itself but according to the Buddha it does eventually bring a beneficial result. So our meditation practice is very beneficial and we should not think that there is no point or purpose in doing meditation because we don’ t have the kind of diligence that Milarepa had.It is im p o rta n t to continue steadily w ith  o u r m ed ita­tion practice rather than have intense periods o f diligence and then give it up because there is no result. This kind of di l i gence i s  cal l ed unchanging, permanent di l i gence that enables us to maintain the continuity o f our prac­tice. We need this kind o f diligence. It is im portant both to have this diligence and not to have any attachm ent to meditation experi ences.The Union of Samatha & Vipasyana

Notes1. A ll  T i b e ta n  w o r d s are sp ell ed  p h o n e tic a lly . T h e  translitera­tions for these words are given in the table on pages 158-60.2. The word for “ meditation” in Tibetan is transliterated as sgom (Skt. bhavana) and pronounced gom. The word for “habituate” is goms (Skt. abhyasa), pronounced khom. These words are similar in Tibetan because the s is silent.3. This word is translitered as zhi gnas in Tibetan and is often spelled shi-ne in English. It is pronounced “she-mzy.”4. Some scholars believe that Hashang Mahayana’s teaching was connected with Zen Buddhism. I do not believe so. In the Tibetan texts there is no description of Hashang Maha­yana’s teaching. A number of Tibetans say it was the Chinese tradition that spread to China, but I  believe that it was something particular to Hashang Mahayana. Hashang Mahayana is an individual’s name, whereas Hashang is a general name of a person in the dharma tradition. The history of the sixteen arhats in Tibet says that they were together and did many miracles and that their patron was Hashang. Also, some scholars describe Hashang as a sym bol for the alaya, or ground consciousness. There are six con­sciousnesses, which can be compared to six children who are a bother because they are running around all the time. Imagine an old man sitting with six children jumping about, never giving him any peace. So you have Hashang sitting there with all these children climbing all over him, but he is sitting there smiling and peaceful. This is a symbol for the ground consciousness being unperturbed by the six con­sciousnesses. In this way Hashang is a symbol.There is also another Hashang in Tibetan history. He is143

Notescalled Hashang who is depicted iconographically as carrying a b ig  sack w i t h  h im . He was a teacher and an e m a n a tio n  o f Maitreya who spread the dharma in China. This Hashang Maitreya looks like the Hashang who is with the sixteen arhats. He is, however, completely different from the Ha­shang Mahayana monk who came to Tibet to teach medi­tation.5. There are several kinds o f  subtle airs or winds, called vayus in Sanskrit. There is the vayu of air or vayu of fire. It makes the body warm and provides the heat and well-being of the body. The vayu of the element fire provides the warmth of the body. The vayu of the element water keeps the body moist, pervades the whole body, and has the function of the element of water. The vayu of the element of air provides for the physical movement of the body. The ability to move and the suppleness o f the body come from the vayu (air) of the air element. The movements of both the mind and the body come through this vayu. The vayu of earth provides the stability o f the body and keeps the body from going into a state of change. It gives the body physical solidity. In this way the commentaries talk of the “air o f earth,” the “air of air,” and so on.In general there are four elements: earth, fire, air, and water. Earth is the ground beneath us, water is the material that flows downward, fire is what burns, and air (the Ti­betan word for which also means “wind”) is what moves around us. The earth element has the aspect o f solidity and durability. The fire element has the aspect of warmth and burning. The water element has the aspect o f moistness. The air element has the aspect of movement. These four qualities of solidity, warmth, moistness, and movement are what is meant by the four elements. The functions of the elements are, for example, that the earth makes something very solid and durable and the water element causes cohe­sion and keeps things together. For instance, a finger just doesn’ t disintegrate; it stays together in one piece, and this is the function o f the water element. The function o f the fire element is ripening, causing things to change. For example,144

Notesit is the aspect o f warmth that causes a flower to develop. Things develop, mature, and go into a  state of decline and aging, and the entire process of change is due to the activity of the fi re  element.6. Som e centers do walking meditation between sitting medi­tation periods. During walking meditation there is no par­ticular visualization. One should be aware of each foot as it goes up, then goes down, and so forth. One is simply aware of t he walking movement, a  p ro ces s  s i mi l ar  t o  res ti ng  on the breath. This method is used in the Theravadin tradition and is described in the vinaya texts. In Tibet, however, most meditation was traditionally done sitting down. I  think walking meditation can be very beneficial because it is good for the mind, is good for the body, and doesn’t hurt the knees.7. These times are purely illustrative and should not be taken literally.8. To be  m o r e  precise, e m p t i n e s s  is suriyata (Tib. tongpanyi), knowledge is vidya (rigpa), the union of emptiness and knowledge is vidyasunyasambheda (riktong yerme), and clarity is bhasvara (selwa).9. There is a difference in the understanding o f emptiness depending on whether one uses the hinayana or the maha- yana viewpoint. According to Chandraklrti, the only differ­ence between these two is the degree of realization and the greater number of practices that one does in the mahayana. The quality of the understanding of emptiness is the same. In the beginning o f his work Entering into the Middle Way, Chandraklrti writes that there is little difference. However, toward the end of the text he talks about the two kinds of selflessness: the selflessness of individuals, such as is realized by sravakas, and the selflessness of phenomena in the maha­yana. So there are two different viewpoints among the Tibetans on what this means. Some say that according to Chandraklrti the sravakas do realize the emptiness o f phe­nomena. Others interpret this to say that sravakas do not realize the emptiness of phenomena, only the selflessness of the individual. So there is a  difference on this point among145

NotesTibetan scholars. I  believe that sravakas do not realize the selflessness of phenomena. I  base this on studying the Ma- dhyamakdvatara u s i n g  t h e  c o m m e n t a r y  b y  L a m a  M i p a m , which says that the sravakas don’ t realize the selflessness of phenomena. For example, Tsongkapa disagreed with this view, while the eighth Karmapa, Mikyo Dorje, for exam­ple, says that sravakas do not realize the selflessness of phenomena.Once a  person has reached Buddhahood, he or she has clarity, knowing everything is emptiness. One can’t really look and find this wisdom, this clarity, but the power of the mind is still there. This wisdom is called jnana i n  S a n s k r i t or yeshe i n  T i b e t a n .  S o  t h e r e  i s  t h i s  j n a n a ,  o r  p e r f e c t  wi s ­dom, and then there is also love and power. The love has power because it is love with power, not like the love, for example, of a mother who has no arms and is trying to save her child who is being swept away by a strong current.One may ask if the dharma itself is also empty. The answer is that dharma teachings do not have the nature of true existence in themselves. When one receives dharma teachings, one benefits from them only if one puts them into practice. Receiving teachings without practicing is just hearing words, or if they are written down, it is just black ink on white paper. So they have no value by themselves. Taking another example, what makes a precious human existence valuable? The human body by itself has little value, but when it is put to use, it can have great value. The commentaries refer to the teachings as being like a boat. The boats in the old days were made out of leather, and these were not very valuable. But the value o f a boat is that with it one can cross over to the other side of a  river. In the same way, dharma and precious human existence are valu­able— they have no value in themselves, but one gains great value from them when one uses them.10. O ne might wonder about emptiness and awareness at the time of total liberation. Buddhahood is called liberation, and this is not like something one gets or achieves that one did not have before. Liberation is the realization o f the actual146

Notesnature o f phenomena without any contrivance. Because one doesn’ t realize the natural state of phenomena, one is in a state o f delusion believing in what doesn’t exist. Once one realizes this natural state, then one has attained liberation from samsara. To do this, one. first analyzes phenomena through reasoning. Through this analysis one attains the understanding of the true nature of phenomena. But even though one has this understanding, one still is not familiar­ized with or habituated to it. So one needs to become habituated to the true nature o f phenomena before one has attained complete liberation.Tilopa asked, “Where is the sesame oil?” The sesame oil is in the sesame seeds, but one doesn’t get any sesame oil by simply eating sesame seeds. To get sesame oil, one has to beat, grind, or crush the seeds. It is like that with Buddha- hood: it is within one, but in order to achieve liberation one has to apply oneself to meditation to realize it. Another example of liberation is the analogy of the rope and the snake. If there is a rope in a poorly lit room and one sees it, one might think that it is a snake, and the result will be great fear. This fear arises because of the illusion that the rope is a snake. To be free of that fear, one has to realize that the snake is really a rope, and no other solution such as getting a weapon or taking an antidote to the snake venom is going to work. When one does realize that the snake is just a rope, then all the fear naturally disappears. This happens even though there was absolutely no change in the rope either before or after. The only difference was that before one was deluded, and afterward one discovered the truth. So to achieve the complete peace of mind of Buddha- hood, one has to receive the teachings, follow the methods taught by the Buddha, and contemplate them, thereby removing the delusions and attaining the realization of the true nature o f the mind.ii.

Notes12. In more detail, there is the Tibetan term yeshe (Skt. jhana), which has been translated as “wisdom” in this book. In Sanskrit jhana is not a particularly special word and simply means “to know.” When the Tibetan translators translated jhana into Tibetan, they added the syllable ye to she because ye means “primordial knowledge that has always existed.” This word was then used for the knowledge of the Buddha, who knows a ll things in their ultimate and relative aspects. The Tibetan word sherab, or prajha in Sanskrit, has been translated as “understanding” in this book. The syllable she means “to know,” and the syllable rab means “the best, superior to everything, perfect” in Tibetan. The terms sherab and yeshe are often used interchangeably as “knowledge” and “w isdom .” But one can differentiate between them, because yeshe is the knowledge a Buddha or enlightened being has, which is the direct understanding of phemonena, whereas sherab is the understanding one gains through anal­ysis, examination, and reasoning. Sherab is related to the differentiation of phenomena. In one’s normal experience, all phenomena are merged together, and through the under­standing o f sherab all phenomena are differentiated so that one knows this is this, that is that, this exists, that doesn’t, this is good, that is bad, and so on. So all phenomena are differentiated from each other, and this is the special mean­ing of sherab. T h e  k n o w l e d g e  i n m e d i t a t i o n  w h e r e  o n e knows the true nature of things is rigpa in Tibetan or vidya in Sanskrit. So this clarity, the knowledge o f the true nature of t hings, i s  c a l l e d  rigpa.13. The dedication prayer is said by the lamas and their students usually at the end of each dharma teaching as well as at any sadhana practices:Through this merit may omniscience be attained;Thereby may every enemy [mental defilements] be overcome.May beings be liberated from the ocean of samsara,Which is troubled by the waves of birth, sickness, old age, and death.148

About the AuthorAbout five hundred years ago, the seventh Gyalwa Karmapa founded Thrangu monastery. He appointed as its abbot one of h i s most gifted di sci pl es,  t he f i r s t  Thrangu Rinpoche. More recently incarnations of Thrangu Rinpoche have spent much of their lives in retreat. The present ninth incarnation was recognized at the age of four in 1937 by the Gyalwa Karmapa and Palpung Situ Rinpoche, who prophesied the names of his parents and his place of birth.In the time from the age o f seven to sixteen Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche learned to read and write, memorized pujas, and studied their practice. He then began his formal studies in Buddhist philosophy, psychology, logic, debate, and scriptures with Lama Khenpo Lodo Rabsel. At the age of t went y- t hree h e  r e c e i v e d  t h e  Gel ong or di na t i o n al ong wi t h Garwang Rinpoche and Chôgyam Trungpa Rinpoche from the Gyalwa Karmapa.Following this, Thrangu Rinpoche engaged in a  period of intense practice and retreat and received further instructions from his lama, Khenpo Gyangasha Wangpo. At the age of thirty-five he was given the degree of Geshe Ramjam with honors and was appointed Vice Chancellor of the Principal Seat o f the Kagyii Vajra Upholder o f the Three Disciplines by His Holiness Karmapa. He is full holder and teacher of all the Kagyü vajrayâna lineages and has a special, very direct transmission o f the Shentong philosophical tradition. Being so gifted, he was chosen to educate the four great Kagyii regents.165
