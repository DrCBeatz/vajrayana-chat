THE TWELFTH T AI SITUPA 
Forewor{) 
THE GREAT INDIAN MAHAPANDITA Arya Asanga, due to 
his great aspiration and realization was able to 
communicate directly with Arya Maitreya, Buddha 
Shakyamuni's regent and the future Buddha. From this 
encounter, the Five Great Shastras of Maitreya came into 
this world, which I am delighted to know are being 
published by Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Publications under 
Venerable Lama Shedrup. 
These great teachings from Maitreya constitute one of the 
major foundations of the bodhisattva path, providing 
teachings on both the relative and ultimate truths and 
elucidating the second and third turnings of the Wheel of 
Dharma, the Prajnaparamita and Tathagatagarbha. 
In order to understand the profound and vast .q1eaning of 
these texts, one of my own philosophy teachers, the erudite 
Kagyu scholar and supreme abbot of the lineage, Khenchen 
Thrangu Rinpoche, through his greaf wisdom and 
compassion has elucidated these texts with profound clarity 
and simplicity. 9 
10 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
I pray that these publications, which give a clear 
understanding of the Teachings of Lord Buddha, guide 
limitless sentient beings swiftly to Supreme enlightenment. 
Yours in The Holy Dharma

IT IS WITH GREAT JOY that Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal now offers 
this first edition in our series on the five great works of Arya 
Maitreya- The Changeless Nature (The Uttaratantrashastra), a 
treatise on Buddha-Essence; The Ornament of Clear Realization 
(Abhisamayalankara), a text on the Prajnaparamita; Differentiating 
the Middle from the Extremes (Madhyantavibhaga), a text on the 
Middle-way school; Differentiating Dharma and Dharmata 
(Dharmadharmatavibhaga), a text also discussing the Buddha­
essence; , and The Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras 
(Mahayanasutralankara). 
These works, transmitted from Arya Maitreya -the fifth 
and future Buddha of this fortunate age -to Arya Asanga 
sometime in the 3'd century, comprise one of the major 
foundations of Mahayana Buddhism, the unbroken transmission 
and practice of which continues today. 
This first edition, The Uttaratantra, elucidates the Third 
Turning of the Buddha's teachings on Buddha-essence -the 
inherent qualities and potential for Buddhahood present in all 
beings. The elucidation of this potential, emptiness and 
luminosity inseparable, is the bridge between the Sutra and 
Tantric paths, the view of Vajrayana and the ground of 
Mahamudra, thus it is an essential text for all practitioners. 
12 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The root verses of the text are in prose and thus require 
an oral transmission and commentary to explain their vast 
and profound meaning. In addition to the theoretical 
transmission is the meditative approach to this text, the lineage 
ofwhich has continued through the Kagyu tradition, received 
first by the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje and continuing 
unbroken to the present day. This is what is transmitted here 
through the great wisdom and compassion of Khabje 
Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, the supreme abbot, scholar and 
highly realized master of the Kagyu lineage. 
Through the great blessing of the Kagyu lineage, in particular 
through His Eminence Tai Situ Rinpoche, an emanation of 
Maitreya, and Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche we have produced 
these works for publication in order that they be available world 
wide for dharma students. We pray that through this all beings 
swiftly accomplish·enlightenment and that it be a cause for the 
long life and the flourishing activity of the great masters.

KHENCHEN THRANGU RtNPOCHE (b. 1933) 
A Brief Bioerapb~ 
THE LINEAGE of the Thrangu Rinpoche incarnations began 
in the fifteenth century when the Seventh Karmapa, 
Chodrak Gyatso visited the region ofThrangu in Tibet. At this 
time, His Holiness Karmapa established Thrangu Monastery 
and enthroned Sherap Gyaltsen as the FirstThrangu Rinpoche, 
recognizing him as the re-established emanation of Shuwu 
Palgyi Senge, one of the twenty-five great siddha disciples of 
Guru Padmasambhava. 
Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche is the ninth incarnation of 
this lineage and was born in Kham, Tibet in 1933. When he 
was four, His Holiness the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa and 
Palpung Situ Rinpoche recognized him as the incarnation of 
Thrangu Tulku by prophesying the names of his parents and 
the place of his birth. 
Entering Thrangu monastery, from the ages of seven to 
sixteen he studied reading, writing, grammar, poetry, and 
astrology, memorised ritual texts, and completed two 
preliminary retreats. At sixteen under the direction of Khenpo 
Lodro Rabsel, he began the study of the three vehicles of 
Buddhism while staying in retreat. 
At twenty-three he received full ordination from the 
Karmapa. When he was twenty-seven, Rinpoche left Tibet for 
India at the time of the Communist invasion. He was called to 
14 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Rumt~k, Sikkim, where the K:umapa had his seat in exile. At 
thirty-five, he took the geshe examination before 1500 monks 
at Buxador monastic refugee camp in Bengal, and was awarded 
the degree of Geshe Lharampa. On his return to Rumtek he 
was named Abbot of .Rumt~k Monastery and the Nalanda 
Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies at Rumtek. He has been 
the personal teacher of the four principal Karma Kagyu tulkus: 
Shamar Rinpoche, Situ Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
and Gyaltsab Rinpoche. 
Thrangu Rinpoche has travelled extensively throughout 
Europe, the Far East and the USA. He is the abbot of Gampo 
Abbey, Nova Scotia, and of Thrangu House, Oxford, in the 
UK. In 1984 he spent several months in Tibet where he 
ordained over 100 monks and nuns and visited several 
monasteries. He has also founded Thrangu Tashi Choling 
Monastery in Boudhnath; a retreat centre and college at Namo 
Buddha east of the Kathmandu Valley, and has established a 
school in Boudhnath for the general education of lay children 
and young monks. He also built Tara Abbey in Kathmandu. In 
October of 1999 he consecrated the college at Sarnath which 
will accept students from the different traditions of Buddhism 
and will be open to Western students as well. 
Thrangu Rinpoche, a recognised master of Mahamudra 
meditation, has given teachings in over twenty-five countries 
and is especially known for taking complex teachings and 
making them accessible to Western students. More recently, 
because of his vast knowledge of the dharma, he was appointed 
by His Holiness the Dalai Lama to be the personal tutor for 
the recently escaped Seventeenth Karmapa.

PREFACE 
r-rHE BUDDHIST TRADITION did not remain frozen at the time 
.l of the passing away of the Buddha in the sixth century 
before our era, but rather remained a living tradition, changing 
depending upon the time and place of the practice. To greatly 
simplify, the first five hundred years of Buddhist teachings were 
a time of preserving the teachings by memorizing and reciting 
the words of the Buddha because it was a world where there 
was little reading and writing. Buddhism flourished primarily 
·in India and emphasized the preservation of the great monastic 
tradition. The ideal at that time was the arhat who memorized 
and recited the Sutras, the words of the Buddha, and who 
practiced perfect discipline and purity and meditated on the 
Four Noble Truths. This great tradition is still carried on in the 
southern countries of Asia such as Thailand, Sri Lanka, Burma, 
Vietnam, and Cambodia. It is also practiced in temples as 
diverse as the high Himalayan monasteries of Tibet and the 
Zendos of California. 
Around the beginning of our era another great Buddhist 
tradition arose in India -the Mahayana. This tradition 
emphasized the bodhisattva path and began mainly in the 
northern monastic universities of India, spreading north to 
Nepal, Tibet, China, Japan, and Korea. A bodhisattva was a 
person who did not concentrate solely on his or her own 
enlightenment, but was primarily concerned with bringirig all 
16 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
sentient beings to enlightenment by cultivating compassion 
and the understanding of emptiness. This was elaborated in a 
cannon of Buddhist literature known as the Prajnaparamita. 
In the first few centuries of our era there existed a large 
collection of Prajnaparamita literature which was concerned 
with the inherent emptiness of self and of phenomena and with 
the two truths of ultimate and conventional reality. 
Understanding emptiness can be done either by studying the 
logical arguments of great scholars such as Nagarjuna, or by 
the examination of mind, as is done in both the Dzogchen and 
Mahamudra meditation. 
Along with the Prajriaparamita literature, there developed 
the tathagatagarbha literature which was concerned with the 
existence of Buddha-essence or Buddha-potential which exists 
in all sentient beings. This Buddha-essence is important because 
if all sentient beings didn't have it, then the path of the 
bodhisattva, who tries to help all beings reach enlightenment 
by realizing their own Buddha potential, would be useless. 
The Uttaratantra is the foremost example of this 
tathagatagarbha literature and was written by the great Indian 
Buddhist scholar Asanga with the inspiration from the 
bodhisattva Maitreya. Of the five works of Maitreya, Thrangu 
Rinpoche has given English commentaries on four of these. 
This text, originally written in Sanskrit is known as the 
Ratnagotravibhaga and has been published in Sanskrit by E. H. 
Johnson. This work was also taken to Tibet and translated into 
Tibetan in the eleventh century and is the cornerstone of 
Tibetan Buddhist studies. The Tibetans called this work the 
Uttaratantra. The Tibetan text has been translated into English 
three times-first by Obermiller in 1931; secondly by Ken and 
Katia Holmes in 1979 as The Changeless Nature and again in 
1999 as Maitreya on Buddha Nature, and most recently Buddha 
Nature: The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra translated by 
Preface 17 
Rosemarie Fuchs. We are pleased ·to publish not only a 
translation of the rqot verses done by Ken and Katia Holmes, 
but also to include Thrangu Rinpoche's extensive commentary 
on the meaning of this valuable work. 
Typically, the students in a monastic college in Tibet would 
memorize the 404 root verses of the Uttaratantra. Then they 
would go through these verses line-by-line for several months 
with their lama who would be not only a great scholar, but 
would also have practical meditational experience with Buddha­
essence and would elucidate the meaning of this text for them. 
We are fortunate to have this text by Thrangu Rinpoche 
which essentially allows Western students who do not know 
Tibetan to go through this traditional process.

The Uttaratantra 21 
THE ULTIMATE MAHAYANA TREATISE ON THE 
CHANGELESS CONTINUITY OF THE TRUE NATURE 
Homage to all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. 
1. The entire body of this treatise can be condensed 
into the following seven vajra abodes. 
Buddha, dharma, sangha, Buddha-nature, 
enlightenment, qualities and Buddha-activity. 
2. These are in a natural order and one should know 
the first three abodes to be deriving from the introductory 
and the latter four from the Wise and Victors' Qualities 
chapters of the Dharanirajesvarasutra 
3. From the Buddha comes the dharma, 
from the dharma comes the realized sangha, 
from the sangha, the presence of the jnana nature, the 
essence. 
Ultimately, when this jnana has been made manifest, 
there will be supreme enlightenment, powers and so forth, 
endowed with every ability to accomplish 
the good for each and everyone.

shows the fearless, permanent path, 
to bring realization to those with no realization 
and which, wielding the supreme sword and vajra 
of knowledge and compassionate love 
hews down the seedlings of sufferings 
and destroys the walls of doubt 
surrounded by the dense forests of mistaken views. 
5. Buddhahood is endowed with two-fold value. 
It is uncreated, spontaneous and 
not to be realized through external causes. 
It possesses knowledge, compassionate love and ability. 
6. It is the uncreated because its nature 
is without beginning, middle, or end. 
It is said to be spontaneity since it is peace, 
possession of the dharmakaya. 
7. Its realization is not due to any external cause 
since it has to be realized through pure apperception. 
It is knowledge since it has realization of these three. 
It is great compassionate love because it shows the way. 
8. It is ability because it removes 
suffering and defilements by jnana and compassion. 
Through these first three there is value for oneself 
and through the latter three there is value for others. 
THE DHARMA 
The Second vajra Point 
9. I bow down to the sun of dharma, 
which is neither existence nor non-existence 
nor a combination of existence and non-existence, 
nor something other than existence and non-existence: 
the unexaminable, beyond all verbal definition, 
self-cognizant, peace, stainless, brilliant with the light of

jnana, which completely destroys craving for 
aversion to or dullness towards mental objects. 
10. The dharma is that imbued with 
the intrinsic characteristics of the two truths: 
that which is and that which causes freedom from bondage. 
Inconceivable, not two and concept-free, 
Purity, clarity and the remedy. 
11. 'Freedom from bondage' applies to 
the truth of cessation and the truth of the path. 
Each of these has qualities three, for each, respectively: 
12. It is inconceivable (because it cannot be examined by 
thought, it is inexpressible and it is the knowledge of the 
realized), without the two and concept-free, peace. 
It is purity and so forth, these three being like the sun. 
THE SANGHA 
The Third Uzjra Point 
13. I bow down to those whose mind is no longer obscured, 
the deeply realized who have joana's perception, 
awareness of the total purity present in limitless beings. 
As the true nature of mind is lucid clarity, 
they see the defilements to be without essence 
and hence truly realize ultimate no-self-
peace within all beings. Thus they know 
the all-pervading presence of perfect Buddhahood 
in each and every one of them. 
14. The sangha of the wise, who never regress, 
possesses unsurpassable qualities through pure perception: 
thusness, all-encompassing and the inner. 
15. They have thusness (jnana) 
because they realize the peaceful nature of all beings,

their absolute purity by nature, and that all defilements 
have been non-existent from the very beginning. 
16. They have the all-encompassing, because their 
intelligence, which understands the ultimate object of 
knowledge, perceives that all beings have the nature of 
omniscience. 
17. Such understanding is the seeing of self-cognizant jnana. 
It is completely pure because the 'stainless space' 
is free from hindrance and desire. 
18. The never-regressing deeply-realized are a refuge 
for all beings because of their unsurpassable Buddha-jnana 
since they have exceedingly pure perception, through jnana. 
19. The refuges are presented as three, 
through the aspects of teacher, teaching and those who learn, 
in relation to three yana and to three kinds of activity. 
20. Neither both aspects of dharma nor the deeply-realized 
sangha constitute a supreme refuge which will last forever: 
because they are to be abandoned, one is inconstant 
and one is nothing whatsoever and they (the sangha) fear. 
21. Ultimately, only the Buddha constitutes a refuge for 
beings because the great Victor is the embodiment of dharma 
which is the ultimate attainment of the sangha. 
22. 'Rare and Supreme' because their occurrence is most rare, 
they are stainless, powerful, the ornament of the world, 
the best possible thing and changeless. 
23. That these three rare and supreme arise from tainted 
suchness, untainted suchness, the qualities of immaculate 
enlightenment and the deeds of the Victorious Ones 
is precisely the domain of those aware of the ultimate.

The Uttaratantra 29 
24. The potential for the rare and sublime 
is the domain of wisdom of the omniscient. 
In respective order, there are four reasons why 
these four aspects are inconceivable. 
25. It is pure yet accompanied by defilements, 
and completely undefiled yet to be purified, 
it has truly inseparable qualities 
and is total non-thought and spontaneity. 
26. Since there is that to be realized, 
the realization, the attributes of realization 
and that which brings realization, then respectively, 
the first point is the prime cause, that to be purified, 
and the remaining three points constitute conditions. 
BuDDHA- EssENCE 
The Fourth Vtzjra Point 
27. The Buddha-essence is ever-present in everyone because 
the dharmakaya of perfect Buddhahood pervades all, 
the suchness is without differences and they have potential. 
28. It is taught that all beings possess the essence of Buddha 
because Buddha-joana has ever dwelt _in them, 
the immaculate nature is non-dual and 
the Buddha-potential is named after its result. 
29. The meaning intended by 'ultimate domain' 
should be known through its essential character, 
cause, result, function, endowments, approach, 
phases, all-pervasiveness, unalterability 
and the inseparability of its qualities. 
30. Like the purity of a jewel, space, or water, 
it is always undefiled in essence.

The Uttaratantra 31 
It emerges through aspiration for dharma, 
highest prajna, meditation, and compassion. 
31. Its qualities resemble those of a valued gem 
because it is powerful, of space because it is unalterable, 
and of water because it moistens. 
32. Hostility towards the dharma, 
the view that self-entity exists, 
fear of samsara's sufferings and 
disregard for the benefiting of beings 
are the four sorts of obscuration. 
33 .... of the desire-bound, the mistaken, 
shravakas, and pratyekabuddhas respectively. 
The causes of purification are four: 
strong aspiration for the dharma and so on. 
34. Those whose seed is aspiration for the supreme yana, 
whose mother is prajna, originator of Buddha qualities, 
for whom meditative stability is a comfortable womb, 
and compassion of a nanny-these are born as Buddha's 
offspring. 
35. Its result has the transcendent qualities 
of purity, identity, happiness, and permanence. 
Its function is revulsion for suffering 
accompanied by an aspiration, a longing, for peace. 
36. In brief the result of these 
constitute the respective remedies to both 
the four ways of straying from dharmakaya 
and their four antidotes. 
37. This is purity because its nature is pure 
and all impurities of karma have been removed.

The Uttaratantra 33 
It is true identity because all of the complications of 'self' 
Or 'no-self' have been absolutely quelled. 
38. It is happiness through the demise of the five aggregates, 
which are of a mental nature, and their causes. 
It is permanence since the sameness 
of samsara and nirvana have been realized. 
39. Those of compassionate love have, through prajna, 
completely severed all self-cherishing. 
They will not want to enter a personal nirvana 
because they dearly care for every being. 
Hence, by reliance upon these means to enlightenment 
i.e. wisdom and compassion, 
the deeply-realized abide neither in samsara 
nor the quiescence of a personal nirvana. 
40. Were there no Buddha-essence 
there would be no discontent with suffering 
nor desire, effort and the aspiration for nirvana. 
41. Awareness of samsara's shortcomings, suffering 
and nirvana's quality, happiness, 
are due to the existence of this potential. 
Why is this so? Without such potential 
they would not be present. 
42. It is like a great ocean -an inexhaustible abode 
containing precious substances of inestimable qualities. 
It is like a lamp-flame because this essence 
is endowed with inseparable qualities. 
43. Because it contains the essence of dharmakaya, 
the jnana of the Victors and great compassion, 
it has been taught as being similar to an ocean 
through being an environment, its gems and its waters.

The Uttaratantra 35 
44. Since direct cognition, jnana and freedom from stain 
are inseparable within the immaculate ground, 
they are compared to the light, heat and color of a flame. 
45. Suchness is approached in different ways 
by ordinary beings, the deeply realized 
and the completely-enlightened. 
This is how those who see the true nature 
have taught beings about this heart-essence of the Victors. 
46. Ordinary beings distort, 
those who see the truth correct the distortion 
and tathagatas (approach it) just as it is, 
undistortedly and without conceptual complication. 
47. The impure, those both pure yet impure 
and those absolutely, perfectly pure 
are known respectively as ordinary beings, 
bodhisattvas, and tathagatas. 
48. Buddha-essence, summarized by the six points, 
essence and so forth, 
is explained through three phases 
and by means of three terms. 
49. Just as space, concept-free by nature 
is all-embracing, so also is the immaculate space, 
the nature of mind, all-pervading. 
50. This, the general characteristic of all, 
permeates the faulty, the noble and the ultimate, 
just as space permeates all forms 
whether lesser, mediocre or perfect. 
51. Since the faults are only incidental whereas 
its qualities are part of its very character,

it is the changeless rea}ity, 
the same after as it was before. 
52. Space pervades all yet remains absolutely uncorrupted 
on account of its extreme subtlety; likewise this, present in all 
beings, remains absolutely taint-free. 
53. Just as universes always arise 
and disintegrate in space, 
likewise do the senses arise 
and disintegrate in the uncreated space. 
54. Just as space has never been consumed by fire, 
likewise this is never consumed 
by the fires of ageing, sickness and death. 
55. Earth is sustained by water, water by air and 
air.is sustained by space, but space 
is sustained by neither air, water nor earth. 
56. In a similar way, the aggregates, elements, and entrances 
are based upon action and the defilements. 
Action and the defilements are always based 
upon an erroneous way of using the mind. 
57. This aberrant way of using the mind is based upon 
the purity of the mind, yet mind's true nature 
is based upon none of the multitude of phenomena. 
58. The aggregates, entrances, and elements 
should be known as being similar to earth. 
The karma and defilements of beings 
are to be known as similar to water.

The Uttaratantra 39 
59. The improper way of using the mind is similar to wind 
whereas the true nature is like the element of space, 
having no basis and no abiding. 
60. The improper way of using the mind abides 
within the true nature of mind. 
This improper way of using the mind gives rise 
to the defilements and to action. 
61. From the waters of action and the defilements 
arise the aggregates, entrances and elements, 
occurring and disintegrating just like 
all things that have beginning and end. 
62. The nature of mind is like the space element: 
it has neither causes nor conditions 
nor these in combination, 
nor arising, abiding or destruction. 
63. This true nature of mind, clarity, is, like space, 
unchanging, never defiled by desire and so forth, the 
incidental ills which arise from an improper use of the mind. 
64. It is not produced by the waters 
of karma, defilements and so forth, 
nor will it be burnt by the cruel fires of 
aging, sickness and death. 
65. One should know the three fires 
of death, sickness and aging to be similar, respectiv:ely, to 
the fires which blaze at the end of time, 
hellfire and ordinary fire. 
66. Free from birth, aging, sickness and death, 
they 
have realized the true nature, just as it is.

The Uttaratantra 41 
have awakened compassion for beings and, 
even though free from the sufferings 
of birth and so forth, they demonstrate them. 
67. The deeply-realized have radically removed 
the sufferings of aging, sickness and death. 
They are without them because their birth 
is not brought about by karma and what is defiled. 
68. Since they have seen the truth, just as it is, 
their compassionate nature shows 
birth, aging, sickness, and death, 
even though they have transcended birth and the rest. 
69. Those blinded by ignorance see the Victors' children, 
who have realized this changeless true nature, 
as though they were born and so forth. 
This is indeed a wonder! 
70. Those who have reached the domain of realization 
appear within the experience of the immature. 
Thus the skills and compassion of these friends for beings 
are truly excellent. 
71. Even though they have transcended everything worldly, 
they do not leave the world, acting within the world for the 
world but unblemished by worldly impurity. 
72. A lotus, born of water, by water remains unblemished. 
Similarly, even though they are born in the world, 
by worldly beings they are unblemished. 
73. In order to accomplish their task, their brilliant 
intelligence is like a fire blazing incessantly. 
They are at all times profoundly immersed 
in meditative union with peace.

The Uttaratantra 43 
74. Due to previous impetus and being concept-free, 
no effort need be made to bring beings to maturity. 
75. They know precisely the ways and means 
to train anyone and whichever teaching, 
physical form, mode of conduct or action 
would be most appropriate. 
76. In this way, those of unhindered intelligence 
excellently engage themselves in benefiting 
beings as limitless as the sky, 
continually and spontaneously. 
77. The way in which these bodhisattvas act in the worlds, 
to help beings, during the post-meditation phase, 
is the same as the tathagatas' way of truly liberating beings. 
78. Although this is true, the differences 
between these bodhisattvas and the Buddhas 
are like those between the Earth and an atom 
or between an ox's hoof-print and the ocean. 
79. Because it has inexhaustible qualities, 
its nature is not to alter. 
It is the refuge of beings 
because it has no limits in the future. 
Right to the very end, it is always non-dual 
because it is non-conceptual. 
It is also of indestructible character 
because it is non-compounded, by nature. 
80. This has no birth because it is permanent, 
no death because it is enduring, 
no ailment because it is peace and 
no aging because it is unchanging.

81. It has no birth in a mental form because it is permanent. 
It has no inconceivable death and transmigration, 
because it is everlasting. 
82. It is unharmed by the disease of the finer imprints of 
karma because it is peace. 
It has no aging produced by untainted karma 
because it is immutable. 
83. This uncreated space has the attributes ofpermanence, 
etc., which should be known respectively 
through the first pair of verses, and likewise the next pair 
and the next pair and the last. 
84. Being endowed with inexhaustible qualities, 
it has the attribute of permanence, the quality of not altering. 
Because it equals the furthest end, 
its attribute is everlasting, the nature of a refuge. 
Because its very character is not to conceptualize, 
it has the attribute of peace: the non-dual true nature. 
As its qualities are not things fabricated, 
its attribute is immutability- the changeless nature. 
It is the dharmakaya. It is the tathagata. 
It is the highest truth. It is the ultimately-true nirvana. 
Like the sun and its rays, these aspects are inseparable: 
thus there is no nirvana apart from Buddhahood itsel£ 
85. In brief, since the meaning of this untainted domain 
is classified into four aspects, dharmakaya and so forth, 
the latter should be known as four synonyms for it: 
86. that inseparable from the Buddha qualities, 
the achievement of the potential, just as it is, 
the true nature, neither false nor unreliable and 
that having, from time immemorial, the very nature of peace.

87. Buddhahood is every aspect of true, perfect 
enlightenment. 
Nirvana is total removal of impurities and conditioning. 
In the true sense, these are not different. 
88. The characteristic ofliberation 
is to be inseparable from its qualities -
replete, numberless, inconceivable and stainless. 
This liberation is the tathagata. 
Compare this to artists specialized in drawing, 
one part or another of the body. 
However, whichever part one knew, 
the others had not fully mastered. 
89. Their king and ruler gives them a canvas, with the order, 
'All of you must now paint my picture.' 
90. Having received the command, 
they commence the painting as best they can. 
However, one of them departs, 
leaving for some far and foreign land. 
91. Since this man was missing, 
through having gone to another land, 
the portrait, in all its parts, could not be finished. 
This is the example. 
92. The artists are generosity, right conduct, patience, 
and so on. 
Voidness, endowed with every finest aspect 
is said to be like the royal portrait. 
93. Prajna, jnana, and perfect liberation are like 
the sun's light, beams, and orb, 
because respectively bright, radiant and pure, 
and being inseparable.

94. Therefore, until the achievement ofBuddhahood, 
nirvana is never achieved, just as without sunlight and 
sunbeams, the sun could never be seen. 
95. Thus has the Victors' essence been described 
through a tenfold presentation. 
One should understand, from the following examples, 
its presence within the confines of the defilements. 
96. Similar to a Buddha in a decaying lotus, 
honey amidst bees, grains in their husks, 
gold in filth, a treasure under the ground, 
shoots and the like piercing through fruits, 
a Buddha statue inside tattered rags, 
97. a monarch in a poor and wretched woman's womb, 
or a precious image inside some day, 
this nature is present within all beings 
but obscured by the impurity of passing defilement. 
98. The impurities correspond to the lotus, the insects, the 
husks, filth, the ground, the fruit, the tattered rags, 
the woman severely affiicted by burning sorrows, and clay. 
The Buddha, honey, grains, gold, treasure, a mighty tree, 
precious statue, supreme ruler of the continents and precious 
image correspond to this supreme, immaculate nature. 
99. Someone endowed with pure divine vision, upon seeing 
a tathagata shining and adorned with a thousand signs, 
within a decaying lotus, would remove him from the prison 
formed by the petals of the 'water born.' 
100. Similarly 
the sugatas, with their Buddha eyes, 
see their own true nature even in those in the worst of hells. 
Their nature being compassion present until the very end, 
they bring freedom from all those veils.

The Uttaratantra 51 
1 01. Once the sugata within the closed, decaying lotus 
had been seen by one with divine vision, 
the petals were sliced asunder. 
Likewise, when the Buddhas see 
the essence of perfect Buddhahood in beings, 
yet obscured by an impure shell of desire, hatred and so on, 
these Victors, through compassion, destroy such obscuration. 
102. A clever person trying to get the honey amid the swarm 
would, having spotted it, employ skillful means 
to separate that honey from the host of bees 
and then actually take hold of it. 
103. Likewise, the great sages with their omniscient vision, 
upon seeing the honey-like causal basis, the essence, 
bring total radical relinquishment of bee-like obscurations. 
104. The person trying to get honey surrounded by myriad 
bees disperses them all and procures the honey just as 
planned. 
The untainted intelligence in all beings is like the honey. 
The Buddhas, skillful victors over bee-like defilements, 
are like the person. 
105. Humans cannot use kernels of grains still in their husks. 
Whoever wants them as food must de-husk them. 
106. Similarly, while Buddhahood, present in all beings 
but combined with defilement impurities, 
has not been freed from the defilements, 
Buddha activity in the three realms will not be accomplished. 
107. Incompletely-threshed kernels of rice, buckwheat and 
barley that are not fully de-husked still have husks and beards. 
Just as these are not usable, tasty food for humans 
likewise the 'lord of all qualities,' present in living beings,

The Uttaratantra 53 
and whose form has not yet been freed from defilements, 
will not give the taste of dharma joy 
to beings afflicted by the hunger of defilements. 
108. The gold of a man on a journey fell 
into a place containing much rotting filth. 
Being itself of incorruptible nature 
the gold remained there for many a century 
in that same place yet quite unchanged. 
109. A god with great divine vision, upon noticing 
it there, 
told someone, 'There is gold here. Once you have cleansed 
this most prized thing, do what can be done 
with such a precious substance.' 
110. In a similar way, the Victors see the quality of beings, 
which has sunken into the filth-like defilements 
and shower upon them a rain of true· dharma 
that they may be purified of defilement's mire. 
111. Just as the gold fallen into the place rotting with garbage 
was seen there by a god who, with great insistence, 
showed the man that most beautiful of things so that it might 
be completely cleansed, so also do the Victors perceive 
that most precious perfect Buddhahood 
within all beings has fallen in defilement's great mire. 
Therefore they teach them all the dharma 
in order that they may be purified. 
112. Were there an inexhaustible treasure underground, 
beneath a poor man's hovel, 
neither would he know of its presence 
nor could the treasure tell him, 'I am here.' 
113. Similarly, as they have not realized 
the very precious treasure contained within their mind,

The Uttaratantra 55 
the immaculate nature to which nothing need be added 
and from which nothing need be taken, beings 
continually experience many varied sufferings of deprivation. 
114. The jewel treasure contained in the poor man's house 
cannot tell him, 'I, the precious treasure, am here' 
and the man would never know it to be there. 
All beings, who possess the dharmakaya treasure 
within the mansion of their mind, resemble the pauper. 
Hence the Great Sages have taken worldly birth, perfectly, 
so that those beings may obtain the treasure. 
115. Just as, in the seeds of mangoes and other fruits, 
the imperishable quality of germinating 
meeting the presence of prepared soil, water and so forth, 
will gradually produce the body of a regal tree, 
116. so also, within the 'rind' confine of beings' ignorance 
and the like, is contained the pure dharma nature. 
When this is sustained by virtue it will gradually attain 
the very substance of a 'King of Victors.' 
117. Just as a tree grows from within 
the skin of a banana or mango fruit, 
due to conditions -humidity, sunlight, air, soil, space and 
time, likewise is the seed and germ of perfect Buddhahood 
contained within the skin of that fruit: sentient beings' 
defilements. 
Due to the condition, virtue, this true nature 
will be seen and augment. 
118. A god, having discovered a precious image of a tathagata 
by the road, yet wrapped in smelly, tattered rags, 
would tell someone about it lying there, on the roadside, 
in order that it be recovered.

119. Similarly, whet} those of unhindered vision, the 
Buddhas, see the very substance of the tathagatas (present 
even in animals), but wrapped within the envelope of 
defilement, they also show the means by which it may be set 
free. 
120. A god with divine vision who had perceived the image 
of the tathagata, precious by nature, yet wrapped 
in smelly rags and lying by the roadside 
would point it out to people, that it might be freed. 
Just like that, the Victors see Buddha-essence (even in 
animals) lying by samsara's road, wrapped in defilements' 
tatters, and they teach the dharma in order that it be 
liberated. 
121. A wretched woman, having no one to whom to turn 
and living in a pauper hostel, may hold the glory, 
of a future king within her womb 
yet not know this ruler of men to be present within her. 
122. Worldly existence is like the pauper hostel 
and impure beings are like the pregnant woman. 
Having this being within her, she has a protector 
and the embryo is like the immaculate nature. 
123. The woman is dressed in dirty clothes, 
her form is unpleasant and she must endure, 
in the pauper home, the worst of sorrows 
even though a ruler dwells within her womb. 
Similarly, even though a protector resides within, 
beings believe themselves undefended and never find 
peace of mind. By defilements overpowered, 
they remain in 'the ground of suffering.' 
124. Upon seeing a complete and peaceful statue, 
cast in gold yet still within its clay mould, externally like clay,

those who know remove the outer covering 
to expose the gold that lies within. 
125. The perfectly enlightened perfectly see tha~ the nature of 
mind, luminous clarity, is covered by transient impurities. 
Hence, they cleanse beings, who are like mines 
of precious gems, of their obscurations. 
126. Just as an expert removes all the clay, knowing the nature 
of the peaceful statue contained in the bright, stainless gold, 
likewise the omniscient know mental peace, 
like cleansed gold. 
Chipping away, by means of dharma explanation, 
they clean away each and every obscuration. 
127. Within the lotus, bees, husk, filth, ground, fruit skin, 
tattered rags, woman's womb and the clay mould are 
128. the Buddha, honey, kernel, gold, treasure, great tree, 
precious image, universal monarch and golden figure. 
129. Similarly it is said that the shell of defilement 
covering the nature of beings is beginningless 
and unconnected with it and that the stainlessness 
of that nature of mind is beginningless. 
130. Desire, aversion and ignorance and these in active state 
or as latent imprints to be abandoned through insight, 
or to be abandoned through cultivation (of insight)-
the impurities present in the impure 
and the impurities present in the pure-
131. are nine things illustrated by 
the example of the lotus 'shell' and so forth. 
The 'shell' of subsidiary defilements 
divides into infinite categories.

The Utta,ratantra 61 
132. Summarized briefly, the nine impurities, desire, etc., 
have been well illustrated through nine examples, 
the lotus 'shell' and so forth respectively. 
133. The impurities cause, respectively, 
the four impurities of ordinary beings, 
one of arhats, two of beings training in dharma 
and two impurities of the wise. 
134. The mind is delighted by the 'mud-born,' the lotus, 
but later becomes disappointed: such is desire's happiness. 
135. When irritated, bees sting. Likewise, anger arises 
and brings suffering to the heart. 
136. Just as kernels of rice and other grains are covered 
outwardly by husks and skins, 
so is the vision of the very essence 
obscured by the 'shell' of ignorance. 
137. Filth is something unpleasant. Akin to it is the active 
state, causing those who are involved to indulge in 
gratification 
138. When the wealth was covered over, they did not know 
and could not obtain its treasures. 
In a similar way, the spontaneously-arising 
is concealed by ignorance's latent traces. 
139. Just as the germ and so forth split 
the husk of their grain, through a gradual growth, 
likewise insight into thatness dispels 
the obscurations to be abandoned througltJ.nsight. 
140. Those who, by following the path of the realized, 
have overcome the very pith, beliefs

that the destructible and multiple is a self, 
still have obscurations to be abandoned, The Uttaratantra 63 
through the primordial wisdom of the path of cultivation. 
These have been illustrated as being like tattered rags. 
141. The impurities which remain in the seven profound 
levels are compared to the impurities in the confines of a 
womb. 
Release from them is like freedom from that womb 
whereas non-conceptual jnana is like final maturation. 
142. The impurities related in the three profound levels 
should be known as similar to the traces of clay. 
These are the ones to be eliminated by 
the vajra-like samadhi of the 'Great Sel£' 
143. Thus nine impurities, desire and so forth, 
correspond to the lotus and other (examples). 
Buddha-essence corresponds to the Buddha and so on, 
being the union of three natures. 
144. Its three natures are the dharmakaya, tathata and gotra, 
to be understood respectively 
through three, one, and five examples. 
145. The dharmakaya should be known as two: 
the perfecdy immaculate dharmadhatu 
and the favorable conditions for it -
the teachings in their profound and manifold aspects. 
146. As it transcends the world, there is no example for it 
manifestation within the world, thus it has been represented 
by representing the essence to the form of a Tathagata. 
147. The teachings in their subtle and profound aspect 
should be known to be like the unique taste of honey.

The teachings in their manifold aspect 
are like the various grains in their husks. The Uttaratantra 65 
148. Thatness is said to be similar to the substance of gold 
because this essence is immutable, perfectly pure and noble. 
149. One should know the potential as having two aspects, 
similar to the treasure and the tree grown from the fruit: 
that naturally present since begiriningless time 
and that perfected through proper cultivation. 
150. From this twofold potential comes achievement 
of the three Buddhakayas: the first through the former 
and the other two through the latter. 
151. The embodiment of the magnificent essence 
should be known as being similar to the statue 
made of precious substances, being natural and non-created 
and a treasure of jewel-like qualities. 
152. The perfect expression is like the chakravartin, 
being endowed with the greater dharma's majesty. 
Like the golden image are the emanations, 
having the very nature of a representation. 
153. This ultimate truth of the spontaneously born 
is to be understood by faith alone: the orb of the sun may 
shine but it cannot be seen by the blind. 
154. There is nothing whatever to remove from this 
nor the slightest thing thereon to add 
Truly beholding the true nature, 
when truly seen, complete liberation. 
155. The element is devoid of transient things to be purified, 
that have a character separable from it.

It is not devoid of the ultimate qualities 
of character indiffereritiable from it. The Uttaratantra 67 
156. He had taught in various places that every knowable 
thing is ever void, like a cloud, dream or illusion. 
Why therefore did the Buddha declare the essence of 
Buddhahood to be present in every sentient being? 
157. There are five mistakes: faint-heartedness, 
contempt for those oflesser ability, belief in the false, 
slandering the true meaning and self-cherishing. 
So that those in whom the above exist may rid themselves 
of these, thus it was declared. 
158. The ultimate and true nature is always devoid 
of any compounded thing. 
Therefore it is taught that defilements, actions 
and their full maturation are like a douds and so forth. 
159. The defilements are taught to be like douds, 
karma is likened to the experience in dreams 
and the full ripening of karma and defllements, 
the aggregates, are likened to conjurations. 
160. Thus was it presented previously and then 'the element 
exists' was taught ultimately as this continuum in this way 
so that these five faults could be abandoned. 
161. Not learning this, some people are disheartened, 
through mistaken self-contempt; 
bodhichitta will not develop in them. 
162. Some people, through pride, think, 'I am better,' 
because bodhichitta has dawned in them. 
They dwell insistently in the notion that 
those in whom it has not dawned are inferior.

163. Right understanding cannot arise 
in those who think like this. 
Thus, since they misinterpret the true, 
they will not understand the truth. 
164. Beings' defects are not truly real, The Uttaratantra 69 
as they are but a fabrication and incidental. 
In reality, these faults are not entities 
whereas the qualities are naturally pure. 
165. If one clings to the faults, the untrue, 
and disparages the qualities, the true, 
one will not have the loving kindness of the wise 
which sees the similarity between oneself and others. 
166. Through learning in such a fashion, there arises 
enthusiastic diligence, respect (as for a Buddha), 
prajna, jnana, and great love. 
167. Due to the growth of these five qualities, 
unhealthy aspects will be absent and similarity will be seen. 
Through faultlessness, innate qualities and loving kindness 
which recognizes the similarity of self and other, 
Buddhahood will be swiftly achieved.

The Uttaratantra 71 
170. That which has been described as 'its nature is lucid 
clarity' is like the sun and space, obscured by the thick veils 
of those multitude of'douds' which are merely incidental; 
the defilements and the cognitive obscuration. 
Buddhahood has no stain, is endowed with Buddha-qualities, 
and is permanent, everlasting and without change. 
Its achievement depends upon non-conceptual jnana 
and analytical jnana regarding all phenomena. 
171. Buddhahood is indivisible yet one can categorize it 
according to its qualities of purity-
the two qualities of jnana and freedom, 
comparable to the sun and to space. 
172. This luminous clarity is uncreated. 
It is that which pervades without any differentiation, 
possessing all Buddhahood's qualities, far greater in number 
than the sand grains in the river Ganges. 
173. The defilements and cognitive obscurations ar~ said to 
be like covering clouds, since they are, by nature, non­
existent, they spread everywhere and are but incidental. 
174. The two jnana, considered as non-conceptual ensuing, 
cause freedom from these two veils. 
175. Like a lake of purest water gradually overspread by 
lotuses, like the full moon set free from Rahu's mouth 
and like the sun liberated from the banked defilement douds, 
this is radiantly manifest; stainless and bearing all qualities. 
176. Such Buddhahood is like the Victor, the best of all, 
like the honey, the 'kernels, the gold, so valuable, 
the treasure, the great tree, the image of the Sugata, 
made that which is precious and pure, 
like the king of the worlds and like the statue of gold.

The Uttaratantra 73 
177. Purity, as absence of incidental defilements, desire and 
so on, is like the waters of the lake and so forth. 
In brief, it is described as being the fruit of non-conceptual 
jnana. 
178. Authentic attainment of the Buddha-kaya, 
endowed with the finest of all qualities, 
is taught as being the fruit of ensuing jnana. 
179. This is like the lake of pure waters and so on 
because the silt of desire has been removed 
and because it causes the waters of meditative stability 
to sustain the 'lotus' beings who are to be trained. 
180. It is like the unblemished full moon since, 
freed from hatred's 'Rahu,' it embraces all beings 
with its light of great compassion and loving kindness. 
181. Buddhahood is like the immaculate sun because, 
completely free of ignorance's douds, it dispels beings' 
darkness with the radiance of its primordial wisdom. 
182. Because it has peerless qualities, gives the taste of true 
dharma and is free from the shell of ignorance, 
it is likened to the Sugata, to honey and to the kernel. 
183. Because it is naturally pure, 
because it dispels beings' poverty by its own wealth of 
qualities and because it gives the fruit of total liberation, 
it is likened unto gold, a treasure and the great tree. 
184. Because it is the 'embodiment of jewel qualities,' 
because it is the 'supreme lord of bipeds' and because its form 
is an image precious in its composition, it is likened to the 
bejeweled object, the king and what is golden.

The Uttaratantra 75 
185. Enlightenment, untainted and all-pervading, 
is of an indestructible nature because it is everlasting, at 
peace, permanent and undying. 
It is the ground for benefiting beings. 
The tathagata are like space, the basis for the objects of the six 
sense faculties to be experienced by those who are excellent. 
186. It is the condition for form beyond the four elements to 
be seen, for the good and pure sound to be heard, 
for the pure fragrance of the Sugatas' perfect conduct to be 
smelled, for the taste of the dharma of the great 
and of the deeply-realized to be savored, 
187. for the bliss felt in samadhi to be experienced 
and for the very essence, the profound nature, to be realized. 
Therefore, when considered 
in a very fine way, 
the Tathagata, who give birth to true bliss, 
are like space, devoid of reasons. 
188. The function of the two jnana, put concisely, is to be 
known as the perfect fulfillment of the vimuktikaya and 
the accomplishment of dharmakaya. 
189. Since they are untainted, 
all-embracing 
and the uncreated ground, 
the vimuktikaya and the dharmakaya should be known 
as having two attributes and one attribute. 
190. It is untainted because the defilements, 
along with their accompanying conditioning, have ceased. 
J nana is considered as all-embracing 
since it is unattached and unimpeded. 
191. They are uncreated since their nature 
is at all times indestructible, 
mentioned and explained as everlastingness and so on.

192. Destructibility is to be known through the following 
four aspects, since they are the counterparts of everlastingness 
and so forth: decay, drastic change, interruption and 
the inconceivable change of death. 
193. Since enlightenment is free of change, it should be 
known as everlasting, at peace, permanc:mt and deathless. 
This intelligence, so stainless is 'the ground' 
because it is the foundation for all virtuous qualities. 
194. Just as space, which is without cause, is the cause 
for the seeing, hearing, and so forth of 
forms, sounds, odors, sensations and mental data, 
195. Likewise, this is the condition for the untainted qualities 
to arise as objects of stable beings' sense faculties, 
through their unimpeded connection with the two kaya. 
196. Buddhahood is inconceivable, permanent, everlasting, at 
peace, immutable, perfectly at peace, all-embracing and 
concept-free. 
Like space, it is uninvolved, completely unhindered, free of 
coarse sensation, invisible, imperceptible, wholesome and 
immaculate. 
197. One's own fulfillment and benefit for beings are made 
manifest through the vimuktikaya and the dharmakaya. 
These two foundations, of own-benefit and benefit for others, 
have the above qualities of inconceivability and so forth. 
198. Buddhahood is the domain of omniscient jnana 
and not within the scope of the three forms of prajna. 
Therefore the jnanakaya should be understood 
as being inconceivable for beings.

199. Being so subtle, it is not an object of study. 
Being the ultimate truth, it is not contemplation's domain. 
Being the profound universal essence, it falls outside the 
scope of the mundane sorts of meditation and their like. 
200. This is because the immature have never seen this 
before, just like those born blind confronted with visible 
form. 
Even the deeply realized are like the newly born 
seeing sunlight from within their room. 
201. It is permanent, as it has no origination, 
everlasting, as it has no cessation, 
at peace, being free from both 
immutable, since it abides in the true nature, 
202. perfectly at peace, since it is the truth of cessation, 
all-embracing, since all has been understood, 
concept-free, since it does not dwell, 
non-clinging, since all defilements have been dispelled, 
203. always unhindered, since obscurations to knowledge are 
purified, free from coarse sensations, being without two and 
highly-suited, 
204. invisible, since it is formless, 
imperceptible, because it has no characteristic, 
wholesome since its nature is pure and 
immaculate, as all impurities have been removed. 
205. Beginningless, centerless and endless, completely 
indivisible, free from the two, free from the three, stainless 
and concept-free such is the dharmadhatu. Understanding of 
its nature is the vision of the yogin who abides in meditation.

206. Unfathomable, greater in number than sand grains in 
the Ganges, inconceivable and unequalled are the qualities 
of the immaculate space of the tathagata, 
purged of every defect and related conditioning. 
207. By various facets of the true dharma, 
through its radiant embodiments and diligence 
in accomplishing the aim of liberating beings, 
its deeds are like those of a king of wishing-gems. 
Although it takes different 'substantial' forms, 
it is not really of such a character. 
208. The form aspects are the cause, establishing worldlings 
on the path to peace, bringing them to maturity and 
predicting. 
Moreover, their presence always graces these worlds 
just as space is the constant abode of the element of form. 
209. That called 'the self-existent,' 'omniscience,' 
'Buddhahood,' 'supreme nirvana,' 'inconceivability,' 
'victory over the enemy' and the 'self-nature.' 
210. is categorized according to its qualities 
of profundity, vastness and magnanimity, 
through the essence-kaya and so forth. 
211. Of these, the Buddhas' essence-kaya should be known as 
having five intrinsic characteristics and, in brief, five qualities. 
212. It is uncreated and indivisible, 
utterly purged, purified of the two extremes, 
definitively liberated from the three obscurations -
defilements, ideas and hindrances to mastery in meditation -

213. it is stainless, completely beyond concepts and 
it is luminous clarity, through being the domain of the yogin 
and through the dharmadhatu being quintessentially pure. 
214. The svabhavikakaya is truly endowed with the qualities 
of inestimability, incalculability, inconceivability, 
incomparability and ultimate purity. 
215. It is respectively immeasurable and so forth 
because it is vast, unquantifiable, beyond the scope 
of intellectual speculation, unique and rid of even 
conditioning. 
216. It takes the form of perfect expression because 
it perfectly uses the various dharmas, it manifests real 
attributes, it has uninterrupted activity which benefits beings, 
as it is the natural outflow of pure compassion, 
217. it fulfills aspirations, completely, exactly, spontaneously 
and without conceptual agitation, and because it has 
miraculous abilities, like those of a wish-fulfilling gem. 
218. It is shown here in five facets, those of uninterrupted 
speech, emanations and deeds, and through the fact that 
these are not at all contrived and do not manifest its true 
identity. 
219. Just as a gem is not really the various hues it can assume, 
so likewise is the all-embracing not as it appears to be 
through the circumstances of various beings. 
220. Through greatest compassion knowing all wo,rlds, 
having seen all worlds, while never leaving the dharmakaya, 
through various forms, apparitional by nature, 
the one excellently born into the highest birth

221. descends from the 'Realm ofGreatJoy,' 
enters the royal womb and is nobly born in Jambudvipa. 
Perfectly skilled in each science and art, 
222. delighting in his royal consorts' company, then 
renouncing, 
practicing the path of hardship and difficulty, 
going to the place called 'Enlightenment's Very Heart,' 
he vanquishes the hosts of evil. 
223. Then, perfect enlightenment, the turning of the wheel of 
dharma and passing into supreme nirvana. 
In all these places, so impure, 
the nirmanakaya shows these deeds as long as worlds endure. 
224. Knowing the means (through such terms as 
'impermanence,' 'suffering,' 'no-self' and 'peace'), 
the nirmanakaya instills weariness with the world 
in beings of the three dimensions, thus causing them 
to apply themselves to the transcendence of suffering. 
225. To those e~ellently established on the path of peace, 
who believe that they have already attained nirvana, 
it teaches the thatness of all phenomena, 
in the 'White Lotus' and other (sutra). 
226. Through this, they turn away from their former belief 
and are inspired to properly adopt wisdom and skillful means. 
It brings them to maturity within the highest yana 
~d predicts their enlightenment supreme. 
227. Being profound, the very .best of all powers and 
the most clever guidance for the immature, 
according to their individual needs, these are known, 
respectively, as 'deep,' 'vast,' and 'great by nature.'

228. The first of the above is dharmakaya and the latter the 
form kaya. 
Just as forms abide in space, the latter abide in the former. 
229. Through infinite causes, an inexhaustible number of 
beings, compassionate love, miraculous powers, perfect 
knowledge, having the 'best possible' and mastery over all 
qualities, through having vanquished the evil of death, 
insubstantiality and being the 'protector of the worlds, they 
are permanent. 
230. They are permanent because they uphold the true 
dharma, having devoted their body, life and resources to it, 
because they completely fulfill their promise to benefit 
beings. 
231. because the stainless and pure compassion of the 
Buddhas permeates each and every being, 
because they manifest through the bases of miraculous 
powers, by which they display abiding. 
232. because, having perfect knowledge, they are freed 
from believing in a samsara-and-nirvana duality, 
because they have the very best of bliss, 
of constant and unimaginable samadhi, 
233. because even though they act in the world, 
by worldly qualities they are unblemished, 
because, being immortal and having attained the state of 
peace, there is no opportunity for the evil of death, 
234. because the Victors, whose nature is uncreated, 
have been for ever perfectly at peace 
and because they are most suited as a refuge and so forth 
for those without a refuge.

235. The first seven reasons show the permanence of the form 
kaya and the last three show the permanence of dharmakaya. 
236. Since it is ineffable, consists of the ultimately true, 
is not the object of intellectual investigation, 
is beyond simile, is peerless and is comprised of 
neither compounded existence nor 'peace,' 
it is the domain of the Buddhas, 
inconceivable for even the deeply realized. 
237. Inconceivable because it is ineffable, 
ineffable because it is ultimately true, 
ultimately true because it cannot be investigated intellectually, 
unable to be investigated by the intellect 
because it cannot be deduced, 
238. non-deducible because it is peerless, 
peerless because it does not comprise, and 
non-comprising because it does not abide, 
since qualities and faults are not contemplated. 
239. For five reasons is the dharmakaya inconceivable, 
and through them it is extremely subtle. 
Through the sixth reason are the form kaya inconceivable, 
as they are non-substantial. 
240. Through their attributes of insurpassable jnana, 
great compassion and the like, the Victors have perfected 
every quality and are inconceivable. 
Therefore, this final point, the spontaneously present, 
is not even understood by great sages

The Uttaratantra 91. 
THE QUALITIES OF BUDDHAHOOD 
The Sixth l&jra Point 
241. Fulfillment for oneself and benefit for others are 
the ultimately true kaya and its dependent relative kaya. 
The fruits of freedom and perfect maturity 
are their sixty-four qualities. 
242. The ground for acquiring fulfillment for oneself 
is the embodiment of the ultimate truth. 
The symbolic embodiments of the great sages 
are the ground for the greatest possible altruism. 
243. The first kaya is endowed with the qualities of freedom, 
powers and so forth, and the second with those of maturity, 
the marks of a perfect being. 
244. Counteracting ignorance's veils, the powers are like a 
vajra and fearlessness in any situation is like a lion. 
The Tathagata's distinctive qualities are like space 
and the two aspects which Victors manifest 
are like the moon in water. 
245. To know the possible and the impossible, 
the full maturation of action, faculties, temperaments, 
wishes, the paths which determine each and every state, 
246. meditative stability and so on -
that unblemished by defilement, 
memory of former states, divine vision and peace: 
these are the ten powers of perfect awareness. 
247. Such powers- the appropriate and inappropriate, 
full maturation, temperaments, beings' aspirations, 
their various paths, the defiled and the perfectly pure, 
the groupings of faculties, remembrance of former states,

divine vision and the way to exhaust impurity-
are like a vajra because they penetrate the armor of ignorance, 
shatter its walls, and fell its tree. 
248. In everything being perfectly enlightened, 
in bringing a definitive end to obstacles, 
in teaching the path and in stating cessation, 
they have four kinds of fearlessness. 
249. Because they themselves know and help others know 
every aspect of that which is to be known, 
because they have eliminated and help others eliminate 
those things which must be eliminated, 
because they teach and aid others to teach and 
because they have attained and help others to attain 
the utterly stainless highest attainment, 
they truthfully tell others of their own realization 
and, in so doing, are unhindered in any way. 
250. Just as, in every part of the jungle, 
the king of wild animals is ever fearless, 
moving intrepidly among all other beasts, 
so likewise is the 'lion,' the king ofVictors, 
teaching the noble doctrine to the fortunate. 
251. Buddhas are never mistaken and do not chatter noisily 
Their mindfulness is impeccable and their mind 
is never not in meditative equipoise. 
They do not harbor ideas of various kinds. 
252. Never is their indifference something unaware and 
their mighty aspiration is never subject to degradation; 
nor is their diligence, their memory, their prajna, 
their perfect liberation and perception: the jnana of liberation.

253. Their activities are preceded by jnana and this jnana 
is not prone to any deterioration with time. 
These eighteen qualities and others 
are those teachers' attributes alone. 
254. For great sages there are no mistakes, chatter, 
unmindfulness, mental agitation, various forms of ideation 
or casual indifference. 
Aspiration, diligence, recollection, perfectly pure and 
immaculate prajna, constant, perfect liberation and jnana of 
perfect liberation, which is aware of all aspects of the 
knowable -these are theirs and these never suffer from any 
deterioration. 
255. All three activities, whatever they may be 
are preceded by, accompanied by and followed by jnana. 
Their perfect awareness constantly and extensively 
penetrates the three times without hindrance. 
These having been made real, the Buddhas, 
the Victorious Ones with compassion's.magnificence, 
achieve a perfect and fearless turning 
of the great wheel of true dharma for beings. 
256. Earth and so forth have properties of specific character; 
their nature is not that of space. 
The intrinsic character of space, non-obstruction 
is absent in matter. 
Earth, water, fire, wind and space are equally common to all 
of the worlds but not even so much as an atom of the 
distinctive attributes of a Buddha is common to any of the 
worlds. 
257. Perfectly level and marked with wheels, 
his feet are broad and his ankles are not protruding. 
Long 
are his fingers and his toes, webbed.

258. Soft is his skin and fine his youthful flesh, 
his body having seven elevated parts. 
Like an antelope's are his calves 
and like an elephant's are his private parts recessed. 
259. His torso is like a lion's 
and his clavicles not hollow but well-filled. 
His shoulders are elegantly rounded; 
rounded, soft and even are his arms. 
260. His arms are long and his perfectly pure body 
is surrounded by an aura of light. 
His neck, like a conch, is rounded and without blemish 
and his cheeks are like those of the king of beasts. 
261. Equal are his forty teeth. They are very pure, closely set, 
immaculate and evenly aligned; 
the eye-teeth are perfect and excellently white. 
262. His tongue is long, unending and inconceivable, 
possessing the most perfect faculty of taste. 
The spontaneously born has a voice 
like the song of the kalavinka bird or like Bhrama's melody. 
263. The supreme of beings has beautiful eyes, like blue 
lotuses, and like an ox's are his eyelashes. 
With its immaculate white treasure-hair, 
his face is handsome to behold. 
His head bears a mound 
and his skin is pure, fine and golden. 
264. The hairs on his body are exceedingly fine and soft, 
one from each (pore) and curling to the right and to the top. 
His hair is impeccable and like a deep-blue gem. 
As well-rounded as a perfect nyagrodha tree

265. the ever-good and incomparable great sage has the 
strength of Narayana in his firm body. 
These two and thirty marks, 
vividly brilliant and beyond any concept's grasp 
are taught by our Teacher as those of a lord of men. 
266. Just as the form of the autumn moon in a cloudless sky 
is seen in the azure waters of a lake, 
so also are the form kaya of the All-Embracing 
seen by the Victors' Sons in the perfect Buddha mandala. 
267. One should know that these sixty-four qualities 
and their respective causes here follow their order 
in the 'Jewel Discourse'- the Ratna Sutra. 
268. Being invulnerable, undisheartened, peerless and 
unmoving, they are illustrated by the examples of a vajra, 
a lion, space and the clear moon in·water. 
269. Of these, the six, three and one powers 
have completely dispelled, respectively, 
what is cognitive, meditative balance and those 
accompanied by latent conditioning. 
270. Thus they have pierced, destroyed and felled 
those which are like armor, walls, and trees. 
Being firm, enduring, steadfast and invulnerable, 
these powers of the sages vajra-like. 
271. Why firm? Because they are enduring. 
Why enduring? Because they are steadfast. 
Why steadfast? Because they are invulnerable. 
Why invulnerable? Because they are like a vajra. 
272. Being fearless, unconcerned and stable, 
and possessing skill supreme, the lion of humans,

The Uttaratantra 10 I 
the triumphant one, is likened to a lion because 
he is fearless in. the midst of any gathering. 
273. Having definite knowledge of everything, 
the Enlightened remain absolutely fearless of anyone. 
Seeing clearly that even purified beings 
are not their peers, they remain uninfluenced. 
274. Since their noble mind is constantly attentive, 
to each and every phenomenon, it has stability. 
Having transcended the state of latent ignorance, 
so difficult to transcend, they possess skillful mastery. 
275. Worldlings, shravakas, those one-sided, 
the wise and the spontaneously arising, 
have progressively subtler understanding, 
as exemplified by the elements five. 
276. Buddhas are like earth, water, fire and wind, 
being sustenance for all the worlds. 
They are like space, being beyond the characteristics 
of both worldly existence and that which transcends it. 
277. Thus as two and thirty qualities are fashioned 
these aspects of dharmakaya. 
Even so, they are as inseparable 
as the color, brilliance and shape of a gem. 
278. These attributes which, when seen, inspire contentment, 
are known as the 'two and thirty' founded in kayas two: 
nirmanakaya and sarnbhogakaya 
which makes dharma perfect. 
279. Those further from purity and those closer see these in 
two ways: as being in the world or as the mandala of the 
Victors, like the form of the moon, beheld in water or in space.

The Uttaratantra 103 
BUDDHA ACTIVITY 
The Seventh Wljra Point 
280. Ever spontaneous are the All-embracing One's actions, 
regarding the temperaments of those to be trained, 
the means for training them, 
the trainings suited to their dispositions 
and their own movements in terms of time and space. 
281. Endowed with a jnana ocean, 
filled with a multitude of gem-like qualities 
and with the sunlight of virtue and jnana, 
the Buddhas have achieved all yanas. 
Without middle or end, exceedingly vast, 
Buddhahood is all-pervading, like space. 
Perfectly seeing that this treasure of unsullied qualities 
is in every being, without the slightest variation, 
the wind of their perfect compassion dispels 
the complex cloud banks of defilements and false knowledge. 
282. Since thoughts of 'for whom,' 'by what means,' 
'through which training,' 'where' or 'when' do not arise, 
these masters of wisdom are spontaneous at all times. 
283. 'for whom' -the temperaments of those to be trained, 
'by what means' -which of the many training methods, 
'through which training,' -which actions to use to train them 
or 'where' or 'when' -on which occasion. 
284. Buddha activity is unceasing, being devoid of concept 
regarding true freedom, freedom's support, the result of 
freedom, authentic possession of that result, the obscurations 
which veil it, and the necessary conditions for breaking 
through them.

285. Genuine release is the ten levels, 
its cause is the two accumulations, 
its result is supreme enlightenment The Uttaratantra 105 
an enlightenment which beings truly possess. 
286. Its obscuring veils are the endless defilements, 
subsidiary defilements and latent tendencies. 
Great compassion is the condition for destroying these. 
287. These six points should be known as being respectively 
like an ocean, the sun, space, a treasure, 
clouds and the wind. 
288. The levels are like an ocean of jnana waters. 
Possessing the qualities of its ocean's gems. 
The two accumulations are like the sun, 
since by them all beings are sustained. 
289. Enlightenment is like space, 
being vast, centerless and without end. 
The core character of beings is like a treasure, 
being the very nature of utterly pure enlightenment. 
290. The covering defilements are like hosts of douds, 
being transient, pervasive and not entities. 
Compassion is like a mighty wind, 
being ever-present to dispel them. 
291. Since their release is for others' benefit, 
since they see the equality of themselves and beings 
and since their deeds have not been fully completed, 
their activity is unbroken until samsara ends. 
292. Like Indra, the drum, clouds, Brahma, the sun, 
a wish-fulfilling gem, an echo, space and earth 
is the Tathagata.

293. Had the ground here the quality of flawless vaidurya, 
one would see apparent in it, through its clarity, 
the King of the Gods accompanied by hosts of young 
goddesses. 
294. 'Perfectly Victorious' -his resplendent palace, 
the divine abodes, other places with various wonders 
and all the many kinds of enjoyment that the gods possess. 
295. Seeing these appearances, multitudes of men and 
women, living on the surface of the Earth, would exclaim: 
296. 'Oh! May we also, before long, become like this divine 
king!' Having sincerely made such a prayer, so that it be 
realized they would truly adopt vinue and persist in it. 
297. Though they may not appreciate that these are just 
appearances, they would, nevertheless, through virtue, be 
reborn as gods once they had departed from the surface of the 
Earth. 
298. These appearances are absolutely unintentional. 
They involve no movement. Nevertheless, 
their presence on Earth is accompanied by great benefit. 
299. In a similar way, beings with faultless faith and other 
(virtues), will, through practicing these qualities, 
see the perfect Buddha manifest in their minds, 
300. endowed with the marks and meaningful signs. 
They will see him walking, standing, sitting, sleeping and 
enacting all the modes of conduct, 
301. proclaiming the teachings of peace or, without speaking, 
remaining in meditation, performing various sorts of miracle 
and filled with 
magnificence and sple'ndor.

302. Having seen this and felt aspiration for such 
Buddhahood, they apply themselves to it most excellently. 
Through properly adopting its causes, 
the desired state is reached. 
303. These appearances are completely concept-free 
and involve no shift. 
Though this be so, they bring great benefit to the world. 
304. Ordinary beings are believed not to understand the fact 
that these are the manifestations of their own mind, yet 
to see such forms nevertheless brings them benefit. 
305. Progressively, through what is seen, established in the 
yana, they will see the inner true dharmakaya through eyes of 
jnana. 
306. If all Earth were rid of fearful places 
and became flawless vaidurya, 
lustrous and beautiful with all that jewel's qualities, 
free from impurity, magnificent and of smooth, even surface, 
there would appear, on account of such purity, 
the various divine abodes and the form of the King of Gods. 
By the gradual disappearance of such a ground's qualities, 
these things would once again no longer be apparent. 
307. In order to obtain such a 
state, 
many men and women would turn to the 'precepts 
of mindfulness,' true generosity and so forth, 
scatter flowers and do other similar deeds, 
their minds full of aspiration. 
In a similar way, in order to become 
the mighty Victor King, who had appeared in their mind, 
comparable to pure vaidurya 
bodhisattvas develop their 'mind' perfectly, 
their spirit being filled with great joy.

308. Just as the reflection of the King of Gods 
appears in the clear vaidurya ground, 
so also does the reflection of the King of Sages' form 
appear in the clear ground which is beings' minds. 
309. For beings, the appearance and disappearance 
of these reflections occur through their minds' condition, 
polluted or unpolluted. 
Similar to such manifestations of form in the worlds, 
these should not be taken as existing or extinct entities. 
310. Through the power of the gods' former goodness 
the dharma drum in the divine realms, 
without effort, location, mental form or concept, 
311. exhorts all the uncaring gods over and over again 
with its throbs of 'impermanence,' 'suffering,' 
'no-self and 'peace.' 
312. Like this, the all-pervading is also without effort and the 
like, yet Buddha speech reaches all beings, without 
exception, teaching the noble doctrine to the fortunate. 
313. Just as the divine drum beats for devas, 
through their former karma, so also does the Sage's dharma 
speech arise in the world, due to karma. 
Just as its sound, without effort, source, form or mind, 
brings peace, so also is peace procured by dharma 
without effort or the other things. 
314. The sound of the drum in the celestial citadel is the 
cause which both ends divine play and also bestows 
fearlessness, to vanquish asura armies when, through 
defilement, war occurs. Like this, that arising from such as 
formless meditation proclaims, in the worlds, the way of the

insurpassable path of peace, to defeat, totally, sentient beings' 
defilements and sufferings. 
315. Universal, joyously beneficial and having threefold 
miracles, the Sages' melody is superior to the celestial 
cymbals. 
316. The mighty sound of the divine drum cannot reach 
Earthling ears, yet the sound of Buddha speech is heard in 
samsara's underworld. 
317. In the heavens, tens of millions of celestial cymbals 
resound to reinforce desire's fire, yet those whose identity is 
compassion give forth a single melody to extinguish, totally, 
suffering's fire. 
318. The beautiful and pleasant music of cymbals in the 
heavens brings increased mental agitation. 
The speech of the tathagatas, whose nature is compassion, 
turns the mind towards samadhi and stimulates reflection. 
319. In brief, it is said that the cause of happiness 
for those in each and every universe, in heaven or on Earth, 
depends entirely upon that very melody, 
all-pervasively manifest in every world. 
320. Just as those with no hearing cannot experience subtle 
sound and even those with divine hearing cannot hear every 
sound, so likewise is the subtle dharma, the domain of very 
finest jnana, to be heard by only those few whose mind is 
undefiled. 
321. In the rainy season, clouds continually and effortlessly 
pour down vast amounts of water onto the earth 
and are the cause for good and bountiful crops.

322. Likewise, clouds of compassion, without any 
conceptualizing, rain down the waters of the Victor's noble 
teachings and cause a harvest of virtue for sentient beings. 
323. Provided that the world is engaged in virtue's ways, 
the wind-borne clouds will cause a fall of rain. 
Likewise the wind of compassion causes Buddha clouds 
to cascade their rain of true teachings 
to increase virtue in beings. 
324. In the world, through great compassionate love and 
knowledge, the clouds of the Lord of All Sages abide amid 
space unblemished by either that which changes or the 
changeless. 
As their unspoilt essence, they have samadhi and dharani 
waters, which are the very cause for the harvest of virtue 
there. 
325. Cool, delicious, soft, light water fallen from the douds 
acquires many different tastes, 
by contact with salty and other grounds. 
Likewise the rain of the eightfold water of the sublime, 
falling &om the heart of that vastest cloud 
of compassionate love, assumes many a flavor, 
according to beings' various mentalities. 
326. Those of appreciative faith, the middling 
and those with animosity form three groups comparable to 
·humans, peafowl and pretas. 
327. In the cloudless end of spring, men and these non-flyers 
suffer. 
In the summertime, when it rains, the pretas suffer. 
This example is drawn upon to illustrate how, 
depending upon whether there is a rain of dharma or not, 
worldly beings will either aspire to it or feel animosity.

328. Making a deluge of mighty raindrops, hurling down 
hailstones or thunderbolts, clouds do not consider the small 
fauna or those who run to the hills. 
Similarly, clouds of perfect knowledge and compassionate 
love, with their very fine or larger drops, do not mind that 
some will purifY their defilements while others tend to believe 
in sel£ 
329. In this samsara ofbeginningless birth and death, 
there are five sorts of sentient being. 
Just as there is no pleasant smell in excrement, 
there is no true contentment among those five. 
Their sufferings are like the incessant pain 
of burns, wounds, chemical scalds and so forth. 
The clouds of compassion cause a mighty rain 
of true dharma, which will soothe all these. 
330. Those endowed with prajna have no longing 
for even the highest celestial or human sovereignty, 
having understood that divine death and transmigration 
or humanity's constant searching are all 'misery.' 
They have'also seen, through prajna and through following, 
with faith, the Tathagatas' excellent teaching: 
'This is suffering,' 'this is its cause,' 
and 'this is its cessation' through' understanding.' 
331. Just as a disease needs to be diagnosed, its cause 
eliminated, a healthy state achieved and the remedy 
implemented, so also should suffering, its cause, its cessation 
and the path be known, removed, attained and undertaken. 
332. Without effort and without departing from his Brahma 
heaven, Brahma can manifest his presence in any divine 
realm.

333. Likewise, never departing from dharmakaya, the great 
Victor effortlessly manifests emanations in any sphere, to the 
mature. 
334. Without leaving his palace 1 
Brahma manifests in the sense realm. 
Seeing him there makes its gods 
abandon pursuit of the sensorial. 
Similarly, the Sugatas, while never leaving the dharmakaya, 
are perceived in every world sphere by those who are ready. 
The vision constantly causes them to relinquish impurity. 
335. Due to the power of his former prayers, 
and the gods' own vinue, Brahma appears effortlessly. 
Forms of the Spontaneous appear similarly. 
336. Descent, entering the womb, going to his father's palace, 
enjoyment, solitary practice, the subjugation of negativity, 
attainment enlightenment and teaching the path 
to the city of peace, having demonstrated these, the Great 
Sage became invisible to those of insufficient maturity. 
337. When the sun shines, lotuses and similar flowers open. 
At the same time, the kumata flowers dose up completely. 
The sun has no opinion of'good' or 'bad' that these, 
the 'water-born' flowers, be either open or closed. 
Also like this is the Sun of Beings- the Perfectly-Realized 
One. 
338. The sun, without ideation and by its own light's 
radiation simultaneously makes lotuses bloom and other 
things ripen. 
339. Similarly, without ideation, the Tathagata sun pours 
forth rays of true dharma on those 'lotus' beings to be 
trained.

The Utta'ratantra 121 
340. Through the dharma and form kaya, the sun of 
omniscience rises in the firmament of the essence of 
enlightenment, to send forth its sunbeams of jnana into 
sentient beings. 
341. Due to this, the Sugata sun appears at one and the same 
time in countless reflections in all the 'water vessels' 
which are sentient beings to be guided. 
342. Continually, from amid the sky of all-pervading 
dharmadhatu, in a manner determined by the power of their 
own merit, shine forth the Buddha sun on the mountaip-like 
disciples. 
3.43. Just as the risen sun, with thousands of magnificent rays, 
illuminates the universe, shedding its light in turn 
on first the highest summits, then the lower, then the plains, 
likewise does that sun, the Victorious One, shed his light 
progressively upon the multitudes of beings. 
344. The sun cannot radiate to the depths of space in every 
realm nor show the meaning of what is to be known 
to those obscured by the darkness of ignorance. 
The one identical with compassion shows beings the 
significance of that which should be known, clarity, 
through spectra of radiant multiple color. 
345. When the Buddha goes to cities, the eyeless see. 
They experience, through that seeing, the meaningful, 
free from the various aspects of what is not beneficial. 
Their intelligence illuminated by the light of the Buddha sun, 
those .blinded by ignorance, fallen into the ocean of existence 
and veiled by the darkness of preconceived ideas, 
see the essence they had not previously seen.

The Utta.ratantra 123 
346. A wish-fulfilling gem, though not thinking, 
fulfills simultaneously all the wishes 
of those within the sphere of its activity. 
347. Likewise, Buddha does not think, 
though those of varying aspiration hear various teaching, 
when turning to the wish-fulfilling Buddha. 
348. Such a precious gem bestows the desired wealth on 
others, perfectly, effortlessly and without any concept. 
Similarly, effortlessly and however appropriate, 
the Great Sage remains constantly in the world 
to help others for as long as it persists. 
349. Just as it is difficult for beings here desirous·of such a 
gem to find one, because it lies underground or in the oce<ln's 
depths, so should one know it to be difficult 
for beings here to see a Sugata, since they are poorly fated and 
in the grasp of defilements. 
350. The echo's sound arises due to others' faculties of 
cognition. 
Concept-free, it is effortless, and abides neither without nor 
within. 
351. Likewise Tathagata speech arises due to others' cognitive 
faculties and is concept-free, effortless and neither without 
nor within. 
352. Even though space is nothing whatsoever, non-manifest, 
not a mental object, without foundation, completely 
invisible, without form and not demonstrable, 
353. it is seen as being 'up' or 'down,' yet space is not like 
that. Likewise nothing seen in relation to Buddha 
is like Buddha at all.

354. Everything which grows from the ground develops, 
becomes firm and grows through depending upon the 
thought-free earth. 
355. Likewise, every root of beings' virtue, without exception, 
increases through dependence on the.thought-free Buddha 
ground. 
356. Since ordinary beings do not perceive action without 
effort, these nine examples were taught to annihilate disciples' 
doubts. 
357. These nine examples have been excellently and fully 
taught in a sutra of a name which explains their purpose. 
358. The Wise, adorned with the great light of wisdom, 
born of such study, will swiftly enter all Buddha domains. 
359. The point has been taught through nine examples 
such as Indra's reflection in vaidurya. 
The meaning they illustrate excellently are: 
360. Manifestation, speech, all-pervasiveness, emanations, 
the radiance of jnana, the 'mysteries' of body, speech and 
mind and possession of a compassionate nature. 
361. All channels of effort have been pacified totally, because 
their mind is free of ideation, just like Indra's reflection and 
so forth appearing in the stainless vaidurya. 
362. Here, 'pacification of effort' is the proposition, 
the 'mind free of ideation' is the logical justification. 
The examples, Indra and so forth, help establish naturalness.

363. The point being made is that the Shower of the Way, 
who is beyond birth and death, manifests effortlessly these 
nine; appearances and so forth. 
364. Effortless altruistic action, for as long as existence 
endures and like that of Indra, the drum, clouds, Brahma, the 
sun, the majestic wish-fulfilling gem, an echo, space or the 
earth, is understood by the Great Yogin alone. 
365. Similar to Indra's jewel appearance is manifestation, 
like the divine drum is the perfect bestowing of instruction, 
and like the hosts of clouds are perf~ct knowledge and 
compassion with which the All-Embracing pervades limitless 
beings, up to the summit of conditioned existence. 
366. Similarly to Brahma, they manifest many an emanation, 
without ever departing from their untainted domain. 
Like the sun, they radiate universally their jnana light 
and like the wish-fulfilling gem, perfectly pure is their mind. 
367. Like an echo, devoid of any verbalizing, is the Victor's 
speech. 
Like space, all-pervading, formless and permanent is their 
body and like the earth, the universal ground for all 
medicinal herbs that are beings' virtues, is the state of 
Buddhahood. 
368. One sees the Buddhas in this mind, comparable to pure 
vaidurya, through mind's purity, development of the faculty 
of irreversible faith. 
369. Since this virtue appears and disappears, 
the forms of the Buddha may also appear and disappear. 
However, like lndra, the Great Sage's dharmakaya 
is beyond such arising and destruction.

370. Like him, in a way which is effortless 
and &om this dharmakaya, which is without birth or death, 
Buddhas engage in activity, such as manifestation, 
for as long as conditioned existence continues. 
371. Here follows a summarized meaning of the examples 
taught in which, in order, dissimilarities are eliminated 
from the former to the latter. 
372. The Buddha is like that reflection, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it does not have his melody. 
He is like the celestial drum, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it is not universally beneficial. 
373. He is like that vast cloud, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it cannot remove useless seeds. 
He is like Mahabrahma, but not the same, 
inasmuch as the latter does not engender lasting maturity. 
374. He is like the form of the sun, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it cannot vanquish darkness forever. 
He is like the wish-fulfilling gem, but not the same, 
inasmuch as its appearance is not that difficult to encounter. 
375. He is like an echo, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it arises through conditions. 
He is like space, but not the same, 
inasmuch as that is not the basis for goodness. 
376. He is like the mandala of the earth, being the supportive 
ground for absolutely every single goodness in sentient life, 
be it mundane or supramundane, because the supramundane 
path arises on the basis of the Buddha's enlightenment, 
as do the paths of virtuous actions, concentrative meditation, 
the limitless contemplations and the formless ones.

THE BENEFITS OF THE TEXT 
377. Buddha-essence, the Buddha's enlightenment, 
Buddhahood's qualities and enlightened activity 
are inconceivable things, even for purified beings, 
as they are the domain ·of experience of their Guides. 
378. The wise who trust this domain of the Buddhas 
become vessels for multitudes of Buddha qualities. 
Genuinely delighting in a host of inconceivable qualities, 
they surpass the virtues of every sentient being. 
379. One who hears but one word of this 
and, having heard, has faith, 
will attain greater virtue than another who, striving for bodhi, 
offers golden lands adorned with jewels, equal in number 
to all the atoms in the Buddhafields, 
to the dharma king, daily. 
380. One who hears but one word of this 
and, having heard, has faith 
will attain greater virtue than that of the right conduct 
practiced by the wise, longing for highest enlightenment 
and maintaining proper conduct of body, speech and mind, 
be it even for many cosmic eons. 
381. One who hears but one word of this and, having heard, 
has faith, will attain greater virtue 
than that of the meditative stability of others 
whose dhyana rids the three worlds of defilements' fires 
and brings achievement of the divine state 
of Brahma's paradise, even if practiced as a way 
to supreme, immutable enlightenment. 
382. Generosity brings affiuence, 
right conduct leads to higher states,

meditative stability removes defilements but prajna removes 
all defilements as well as what is cognitive. 
Therefore this prajna is a most excellent thing: 
its cause is to study such as this. 
383. The presence, what it becomes, its qualities and 
accomplishing that which is good: these four points are the 
domain of Buddha's perfect knowledge, as has been 
explai~ed. 
384. Through faith in these, the fact of this presenc;e, 
it being the power and with qualities endowed, 
the wise are quickly ripe for tathagata achievement. 
385. Through faith, one believes this inconceivable domain 
present, attainable by 'someone like me' and, once attained, 
to have such qualities and such endowments. 
386. Therefore bodhichitta is ever present in them, as a vessel 
for the qualities of earnest aspiration, joyful endeavor, 
mindfulness, meditative stability, prajna and the others. 
387. As this is constantly present, the Victor's offspring do 
not deviate. 
The paramita they establish, through virtue, 
are perfected to become immaculate. 
388. Virtue, as the first five paramita, is brought to perfection 
by an absence of any triplistic thought concerning them. 
They are completely purified by removal of their opposites. 
389. Virtue born of giving is generosity. 
Virtue born of correct action is right conduct. 
Forbearance and meditative stability 
are both born of meditation. 
Joyous diligence is a companion for all.

390.'Triplistic thoughts' are considered to be the cognitive 
obscuration; avaricious thoughts, and the like, the defilement 
obscuration. 
391. Other than prajna, there is no means for removing these. 
Therefore prajna is the best of all the paramita. 
Its basis is study such as this; such study is supreme. 
392. Thus, on the basis of the trustworthy words of Lord 
Buddha and of reason, I have given this teaching 
in order to purifY myself alone and, further, to nurture 
intelligent beings -those having faith and virtue. 
393. Just as when, aided by a lamp, lightening, a gem, the sun 
or moon, those with eyes can see, so likewise, by relying on 
the Great Sage, who radiates the light of meanings, terms, 
dharma and dharani, I have now properly expounded this. 
394. Whatever has significance and is well-connected with 
dharma is a teaching removing the three worlds' defilements, 
showing peace's benefit: such is the Truthful One's teaching. 
What is contrary to this is something other. 
395. Whatever those of perfectly undistracted mind have 
expounded, solely in accordance with the teaching of the 
Victorious One and conducive to the path for attaining 
liberation, should also be placed on the head, like the 
Buddha's own words. 
396. Since no one of this world has more dharma skill than 
Buddha, the Omniscient One who properly knows all 
'Yithout exception as being the supreme suchness, which 
others ignore, whatever sutra were expounded by the Great 
Sage in person should not be adulterated; such would harm 
the true dharma through destroying the way of the Mighty 
Victor.

397. Those who are, through defilement, by nature ignorant 
revile the deeply-realized and despise their teachings; 
all of which occurs through opinions. Therefore the mind 
should never be confined in the impure prison of 
preconception. 
Clean cloth may be dyed with color; never cloth stained by 
oil. 
398. Through lesser understanding, lack of aspiration for 
virtue, indulging in wrong pride, 
a nature veiled by neglecting the dharma, 
mistaking the expedient meaning for the absolute -thatness, 
greed's thirst, ideology's grip, the influence of truth despisers, 
staying far from holders of the teachings and lower aspiration, 
thus is the doctrine of 'the defeaters of the enemy' abandoned. 
399. More than fire, cruel poisonous snakes, 
murderers and lightning should the wise fear the loss of these 
profound teachings. 
Fire, snakes, enemies and thunderbolts only bring life to an 
end. 
They do not take one to the fearsome state of worst torment. 
400. Even one who, through repeated association with evil 
friends, has had harmful intentions towards the Buddha 
or who commits the most heinous acts of killing 
father, mother or an arhat or who creates divisions in the 
noble sangha will be quickly rid of such things once sincerely 
reflecting upon this true nature: how could there be liberation 
for one whose mind hates dharma! 
DEDICATION 
401. Whatever virtue I acquire through having properly

through it, may beings see the Sage of Boundless Life, 
he endowed with limitless light. Having seen him, 
once their stainless dharma eyes are opened, 
may they then achieve supreme enlightenment. 
402. On what basis, for which reasons, in which way, 
that which has been explained and those things in harmony: 
these have been taught by means of the stanzas four. 
403. Two have shown the means for purifYing oneself, 
then the causes for the loss and, through two stanzas, 
an explanation of the result. 
404. In brief, the twofold result has been explained 
in what is said in the last one: the surrounding mandala, 
forbearance and the attainment of enlightenment. 
The Uttaratantra was composed by Maitreya. 
The Uttaratantra was translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan by the 
great scholar Sadzana who was a grandson of the Brahmin 
Ratnavajra, who was born in the "City of Glory, which we believe 
is the city ofShrinagar (Kashmir). It was also translated in that 
same "City of Glory" by the Tibetan monk Loden Sherab.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
'""T1HE BUDDHA gave many teachings. These teachings were 
.l presented as the three turnings of the wheel of dharma. 
$: The subject matter of the first turning of the wheel of 
dharma is the Four Noble Truths. These truths are: the truth of 
suffering; the truth of the origin of suffering; the truth of the 
cessation of suffering; and the truth of the path. The teachings 
of this first turning were aimed at individuals who did not have 
the sharpest intelligence. They needed teachings that were easy 
to comprehend. In this turning the Buddha stated there was 
suffering, that the defilements were the cause of suffering, and 
that it was possible to be liberated from all of this. Everything 
in this turning was phrased in terms of something tangible and 
in terms of conventional reality or relative truth. 
$: In the second turning the Buddha assumed a different 
perspective when he explained that everything that appears to 
exist actually does not exist in the way that it appears. In this 
turning the Buddha said in the Heart Sutra, "There is no form, 
no sound, no smell, no taste ... " etc., demonstrating that all the 
objects of the senses and all the forms of appearance are simply 
illusory. He explained that they have no ultimate reality, that 
the actual nature of all phenomena is emptiness. 
$: In the second turning the Buddha established that all 
phenomena are empty but he did not provide further 
elucidation. However, in the third turning, the Buddha revealed 
142 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the ultimate nature of phenomena and explained that this 
emptiness was not a total absence, a total void of everything, 
but was a manifestation of the qualities of the ultimate nature 
of phenomena. He also taught that all beings possess the essence 
of the Buddha and that anyone who enters the path and 
continues to practice will be able to develop the perfect 
knowledge of the Buddha. The Uttaratantra explains that this 
essence of Buddhahood is present in the mind of all beings. 
Mter the teachings of the third turning were presented 
learned teachers composed many works that pertained to this 
same subject matter. For example, the bodhisattva Maitreya 
composed five teachings on this topic: Ornament of Mahayana 
Sutras, Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata, Distinguishing 
the Middle from the Extremes, Ornament of Clear Realization 
and the Uttaratantra Shastra (see pg 479). 
This Commentary 
The Uttaratantra, one of the five teachings ofMaitreya, is related 
to the third turning. This explanation 1 of the Utiaratantra is 
based on the commentary by jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye and 
consists of two main parts. The first part, which is reviewed in 
this chapter, is a general introduction that covers seven topics: 
the nature of the text, the source, the author, its propagation, 
transmission of the text, subject matter and styles of explanation. 
The second part of the commentary explains the actual text 
and is divided into eight points: the Buddha, the dharma, the 
sangha, Buddha essence, enlightenment, qualities, activity and 
benefits of the text. 
General Introduction 143 
1: The Buddha's Own Teachings or a Shastra 
The first point of the introduction explains that there are 
two kinds of Buddhist teachings -the words of the Buddha 
(Skt. sutras) and the commentaries on the Buddha's works 
composed by others (Skt. shastrasY. One might think the 
Uttaratantra is composed from the words of the Buddha because 
Maitreya is a representative of the Buddha. 3 However, as this 
work is related to the subject matter taught in the third turning, 
it is more appropriate to consider it as an explanatory text 
composed by someone other than the Buddha. 
2: The Source ofThis Work 
The second point contains a discussion of the source upon 
which the Uttaratantra relies. Some claim this teaching is related 
to the Mind-only (Skt. Chittamatra) school, but this is not so 
because this teaching relates direcdy to the teachings on absolute 
truth. The Uttaratantra derives its subject matter from all the 
sutras of the three turnings -it is like a quintessence of all 
these sutras and it has a particularly close connection to one 
sutra, the Dharanirajesvara, taught at the request of King 
Ishvara. 
3: The Author 
The third point examines the authorship of this work. In 
general, authors who have one of three qualifications produce 
shastras: the best qualification is a direct understanding of the 
absolute truth of phenomena. If the author does not have this 
understanding, then the second best qualification is a personal 
experience with a deity such as Manjushri. The poorest 
qualification is a good education that includes a thorough 
knowledge of the five branches of the sciences. 4 Texts written 
144 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
by someone who does not possess one of these three 
qualifications would not be considered a Buddhist commentary. 
Maitreya, the author of the Uttaratantra, is even more qualified 
than the most qualified of authors because he not only possesses 
the realization of absolute truth, but he is a bodhisattva of the 
highest level. 
4: Propagation of the Text 
The fourth point discusses how those teachings ofMaitreya 
are propagated. Buddha Shakyamuni had actually predicted that 
there would be a set of teachings given by one of the highest 
bodhisattvas which would relate to the highest possible meaning 
and that these teachings would be given to men and-propagated 
among them.5 
The Story of Asanga 
The story of the propagation of the Uttaratantra begins at the 
famous Buddhist University ofNalanda in India. A fire started 
by heretics caused serious damage to the university and many 
precious teachings were lost. Most of the Abhidharma teachings 
were destroyed. At that time a nun called Salwai Tsultrim (Ethic 
of Clarity) became concerned that the teachings would be lost. 
For this reason she decided to have sons who would help enable 
the teachings to grow and spread again. Her two sons were 
Asanga, who became a proponent of the Mahayana teachings, 
and Vasubandhu, who became an outstanding proponent of 
the Hinayana or Theravada teachings and later the Mahayana. 
Asanga began by meditating very diligently on Maitreya. 
He practiced for three years and did not seem to be getting any 
results. He became very depressed because he had not 
accomplished anything in his meditation. He then left his 
General Introduction 145 
retreat and on leaving saw a pigeon leaving its nest in a rock 
face. He noticed how the entrance hole had been worn smooth 
by the feathers of generations of pigeons. Seeing this example 
of continued application he was inspired to diligence and 
returned to his retreat. After a further three years without result 
he again became depressed and left his retreat hermitage. This 
time he encountered a man who was removing dirt from the 
top of a high hill. Asanga discovered that the man was removing 
the dirt because the hill was blocking the sun, which he hoped 
would shine on his house. Asanga was so impressed by this 
man's perseverance that he decided to enter retreat again. 
Depressed after another three years without result, Asanga 
again left his retreat. This time he met a man rubbing an iron 
bar with a cloth. Intrigued by this, Asanga asked what he was 
doing and was told he was making a sewing needle. Again, 
inspired by such diligence and forbearance for such a small 
return, Asanga returned to his retreat. 
Having meditated for twelve years he still did not feel he 
was getting anywhere with his meditation and became depressed 
again. He left his retreat and on the way he saw a dog that was 
very sick and thin. The dog was very angry and ready to bite 
him. Suddenly, Asanga felt strong compassion for the dog 
because he noticed that the dog had worms in its wounds. He 
wanted to remove the worms to help the dog, but realized that 
if he pulled the worms off, he would kill them. It was a choice 
between killing the worms or leaving the worms on the dog 
which would eventually cause the dog to die. Asanga, 
overwhelmed by a strong compassion for both, felt that he must 
find a way to get the worms out of the dog's wounds. He 
thought, "If I take the worms off with my tongue, then the 
worms will not be hurt and the dog will get better." He leaned 
down and stuck out his tongue. Instead of touching the dog 
Asanga touched the ground and then Maitreya appeared before 
146 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
him. Seeing Maitreya he exclaimed, "How is this possible! I 
have been practicing this meditation for twelve years and haven't 
been able to meet you. You really don't have much compassion 
for me." Maitreya said, "It wasn't my lack of compassion. I was 
there the whole time but you couldn't see me because you had 
too many obscurations. After twelve years of practice your 
obscurations had become so slight that when you saw the dog 
your compassion enabled you to see me." To prove the point, 
Maitreya suggested that Asanga go into the nearby village with 
Maitreya on his shoulder and ask people what they could see. 
Most of the villagers saw nothing and thought him crazy except 
for one old lady who asked why he was carrying a wounded 
dog on his shoulder. 
Maitreya and Asanga then went to the Tuihita Buddha-field 
and there Maitreya taught Asanga the teachings on the second 
turning, especially the teachings of the Prajnaparamita from 
which Asanga composed The Ornament of Clear Realization. 
Maitreya also taught Asanga many of the third turning 
teachings, some of which were related to the relative truth and 
some that were related to the absolute truth of the dharma. 
Three teachings pertained to the relative truth: the Ornament 
of Mahayana Sutras, Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata, 
and Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes. The teachings 
related to the absolute meaning of reality were the Ornament 
ofClear Realization and the Uttaratantra Shastra. Maitreya gave 
Asanga these five teachings that were transmitted to human 
beings of our world. 
5: Transmission of the Text 
In the fifth point the line of transmission of the Uttaratantra 
Shastra is discussed. The teachings ofMaitreya were transmitted 
in two forms -that of the words and that of the meaning. The 
General Introduction 147 
Uttaratantra was given to Asanga, which he in turn transmitted 
to his brother Vasubandhu. Later, Asanga wrote commentaries 
on each of the five transmissions from Maitreya. In this way, 
Maitreya's teachings became more accessible to everyone. 
Asanga's brother Vasubandhu also wrote commentaries on two 
of the five works of Maitreya. He wrote a commentary on 
Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata and Distinguishing the 
Middle from the Extremes. 
Among these five teachings, three were disseminated quite 
widely. These three were the Ornament of Clear Realization, 
Distinguishing the Middle .from the Extremes, and the Ornament 
of the Mahayana Sutras, which were transmitted by Vasubandhu 
to his disciple Dignaga. Dignaga passed them to his disciple Lodro 
Tenpa who was responsible for the extensive dissemination of 
these three teachings. The other two sets of teachings, the 
Uttaratantra and Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata, were 
more profound and were given to only a few pupils. 
In Tibet there were two periods of history in which the 
Buddhist teachings were widely spread. The earlier period, 
during the eighth century, has been called the "time of the 
three," "the three" being Mahapandita Shantarakshita, King 
Trisong Detsen, and Guru Padmasambhava. During this time 
these first three teachings of Maitreya were translated into 
Tibetan and disseminated widely. The two profound works (the 
Uttaratantra and Distinguishing Dharma .from Dharmata) were 
hidden treasures (Tib. terma). Because they were hidden, these 
texts were not known during this first period. Much later 
Maitripa, one of Marpa's gurus, discovered these two texts in a 
cracked stupa from which a brilliant light emanated. Becoming 
curious, Maitripa found the two texts inside the crack. When 
he read these texts, he found that their true meaning was very 
profound. Because Maitripa was not sure that he understood 
these texts, he prayed to Maitreya who appeared to him and 
148 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
provided him with the reading transmission of these texts. After 
he had been given the reading transmission, Maitripa could 
understand the texts clearly. These teachings were then passed 
on to many great Indian scholars. 
Later these deeper teachings were disseminated 
throughout Tibet. There were two main lines of transmission 
-the explanation lineage and the meaning lineage. The 
explanation lineage was transmitted mainly by Ngog Loden 
Sherab. He was a translator who traveled to a predominately 
Muslim part of India where he received the teachings of the 
Uttaratantra and Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata. He 
then translated them into Tibetan. His approach followed that 
of the Mad,hyamaka school. At the same time, another lama, 
Tsen Kawoche, received meditation instructions of the 
Uttaratantra from the Inclian teacher, Guru Sajjana. He 
meditated on this text in an attempt to understand its 
profound meaning and as a result, the meditation transmission 
of the Uttaratantra was created. 
The main difference between the scholarly and the 
meditative approach is that in the meditative approach 
"emptiness" is not understood as the absence of everything, 
but as containing the essence of Buddhahood. In order to 
understand this approach one meditates on emptiness as 
~ontaining the essence of Buddhahood. This tradition 
combined the theoretical material of the Uttaratantra with the 
meditation practices of Mahamudra. This tradition, based on 
the five teachings of Maitreya, was passed on to the third 
Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje. He wrote a short summary of the 
Uttaratantra and through him the Uttaratantra was transmitted 
to all the main lamas of the Kagyu lineage. For example, this 
teaching was transmitted to the Eighth Shamarpa Rinpoche, 
Choji Dondrup, the Eighth Tai Situpa Rinpoche, Choj"iJungne, 
and to Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye. 
General Introducti<m 149 
6: Subject Matter 
The sixth point concerns the subject matter of the 
Uttaratantra. As mentioned before, the Buddha presented his 
teachings as three turnings of the wheel of dharma. All his 
teachings, however, have a similar root, the essential point being 
the absence of a "self." Some religions believe that if one does 
what pleases God or the gods, they will be rewarded and will 
obtain greater happiness. They also believe that if one does 
something that offends God or the gods, one will encounter 
misfortunes and fall into a lower realm. There is no such belief 
in the Buddhist teachings. What happens to any particular being 
is not the result of pleasing or displeasing a god. The Buddha's 
teachings are based on the study of the true nature of things. 
Only when the nature of phenomena is completely understood, 
will one attain Buddhahood. If one does not understand the 
nature of things, one continues to live in conditioned existence 
(Skt. samsara). 
The key to all Buddhist teachings is the twofold absence of 
self and of phenomena. 6 Normally, we believe that we are a 
separate "self" and this belief in a "self" arises from the idea of 
"I." As soon as we think "I" or "myself," the wish to keep this 
"I" happy and com'fortable develops, which in turn gives rise 
to desire. We want to provide that "I" with all the happiness 
that we can find. When this "I" feels threatened, the threat 
generates anger. This "I" also believes that it is superior to, and 
has better qualities than others. This will generate pride. If this 
"I" fears there are others who are as good or better, jealousy 
will be generated. To summarize, as soon as the belief that the 
individual self exists as a real entity arises, all the five negative 
disturbing emotions (Skt. kleshas) of desire, anger, aversion, 
pride, and jealousy are generated. The belief in the existence of 
phenomena is a direct consequence of the belief that the self is 
150 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
real. When we believe we exist, we also believe that all 
phenomena we experience also exists.? 
The main point of Buddhist practice is to eliminate the 
belief in the reality of self and therefore of phenomena. The 
best way to eliminate the belief in the reality of a self is to 
investigate the location of the one who thinks "I am." Thinking 
"I," one asks "who is thinking 'I'?" Then one tries to find this 
"I" somewhere. If one meditates on this and investigates it 
closely, one will not find anything that can be called the "I." 
Through this process one will understand that the self has no 
objective existence. 8 The belief in the existence of real 
substantial phenomena is more difficult to eliminate. However, 
when one considers the nature of what appears to us more 
closely, one will begin to see that phenomena are very much 
like a bubble in water or a dream. None of these things are 
solidly real. 
To summarize, the principal purpose of all three turnings 
of the wheel of dharma is to explain the emptiness of self and 
of phenomena. The absen:ce of a "self" is emptiness (Skt. 
shunyata), but this emptiness is not to be understood as 
blankness, a complete void. It is not like empty space because 
empty space is frozen. No change can manifest from it. Shunyata 
has a different quality. This emptiness is by nature luminous 
clarity (Tib. salwa). 9 Having the nature of luminous clarity 
means that when beings are still impure, all the various 
appearances of phenomena can manifest within this luminous 
clarity. When individuals have eliminated their impurities, 
within this same luminous clarity Buddhahood can manifest. 
Within this luminous clarity the forms (Skt. kayas) of the 
Buddha and the activity of the Buddha manifest. 10 This 
emptiness is filled with all of these possibilities. In order for 
everything to manifest in the impure and the pure phase, this 
emptiness must be indivisible from luminous clarity. Luminous 
General Introduction 151 
clarity represents the very vivid wisdom aspect of Buddha­
essence. In this way luminous clarity and emptiness are 
completely united. The union of these two is the essence of 
all Buddhas and is present within the mind of all beings. If 
one can experience the unity of luminous clarity and 
emptiness, one can reach Buddhahood. This essence of 
Buddhahood is present in all beings. There is no difference 
in this respect between a man and a woman or between people 
of different races or social classes because everyone possesses 
this essence of enlightenment. 
The reason one does not recognize the essence of 
enlightenment is that it is obscured by defilements. One can 
distinguish three stages of defilements. In the impure phase, 
the stage of ordinary beings, Buddha-essence is totally 
obscured by defilements. In the second phase, that of the 
bodhisattvas, the impurities are slightly purified, the 
obscurations have partially dissolved. Finally, in the phase of 
total purity, one is a Buddha. 
The concept ofBuddha-essence is central to the Buddhist 
teachings and is someti.mes referred to by the Sanskrit word 
gharba, which means "the inner core of something." For 
example, if one has a grain with a husk, the essential part of 
the grain is called the "gharba." In the same way, human beings 
contain the essence of Buddhahood but fleeting impurities 
cover it. This kernel, Buddha-essence, is the main topic of 
the Uttaratantra. 
7: Styles of Explanation 
In this point the different ways of presenting the teachings 
are discussed. As has been mentioned before, there are two 
different ways in which Buddha-essence can be understood. 
The tradition of Loden Sherab, based on the more intellectual 
152 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
approach is connected with the Madhyamaka tradition. The 
second approach, developed by Tsen Kawoche, involves the 
immediate apprehension of the subject matter through 
meditation. This latter approach is the more direct approach, 
in which one meditates on the Mahamudra and the actual 
meaning of the nature of phenomena. 
Part One 
THE GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED: 
THE THREE RARE AND 
PRECIOUS REFUGES 

INTRODUCTION TO THE TEXT 
Name of the Text 
In Sanskrit, Mahayanuttaratantrashastra, 
in Tibetan, thek pa chenpo gyu lama tan cho 
in English, 'The Ultimate Mahayana Treatise on 
the Changeless Continuity of the True Nature.' 155 
MOST TIBETAN TEXTS that have been translated from Sanskrit 
provide both the Sanskrit name and the Tibetan name 
in the title. Ordinarily, they also contain a salutation by the 
translator, addressed to an emanation of the Buddha, 
requesting that the blessing of the Buddha will enable the 
translator to go forward without any obstacles. Following the 
title and salutation, the Uttaratantra begins with the actual 
words of Maitreya. 
The Uttaratantra was originally written in Sanskrit, which 
is called "the language of the gods." This work was then 
translated into Tibetan in order to make it accessible to Tibetans 
who could then read, contemplate and meditate on its contents. 
The title of the text includes both its Tibetan and Sanskrit name 
to honor both the memory of the translators through whose 
kindness the work was made available to the Tibetan people, 
and to indicate that the work was an original Sanskrit source 
taught directly by the Buddhas or bodhisattvas. The Sanskrit 
name, the Mahayanuttaratantrashastra is provided first. It is then 
156 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
translated into Tibetan as thek pa chenpo gyu lama tan cho, which 
in English would literally be rendered "the Ultimate Mahayana 
Treatise on Continuity." Taking each word, "thek pa" literally 
" " "l"ft "r·h. d" "h d"fi'C means to carry or 1 . 1s wor carry as two 1 rerent 
aspects: the process of carrying and the result of carrying. The 
path of the bodhisattva represents the process of carrying. The 
result is reaching the state of Buddhahood. The word "thek 
pa," or "yana" in Sanskrit, can be either small or great and here 
it refers to the great yana. "Mahayana'' in Sanskrit means "great 
yana'' or "great action of carrying." It is considered to be great 
for seven different reasons, some of which are as follows: the 
aim of the path is great (or very wide), the diligence which the 
path demands is great, the jnana or knowledge which develops 
on the path is very great. 
The Sanskrit word for "gyu lama" is "Uttaratantra." This is 
the short name given to this work. "Uttaratantra" can be 
explained in terms of the literal words or in terms of the meaning 
of the terminology. 
The meaning of the terminology is as follows: the first word 
"gyu" means "continuity." There is a continuity represented by 
the words and the continuity of these words creates a clear 
understandable meaning that constitutes the import of the 
work. To this word "gyu" is added the qualifier "lama," which 
means "ultimate," "superior," "higher" or "excellent." This is 
added to "continuity" because the continuity of this text 
contains the deepest meaning. 
In this work, the word "gyu" means "continuity'' but in 
particular it indicates the continuity of the essence of 
Buddhahood which never changes whether it is the ground as 
it is present in all beings, the path when beings are practicing 
the attainment of enlightenment, or the fruition of the path 
when one becomes a Buddha. Throughout all these phases the 
nature ofBuddhahood remains the same. There is an unbroken 
Introduction to the Text 157 
continuity throughout its development. The word" lama" here 
means "ultimate" or "highest" because the type of practice that 
develops out of this text is not ordinary Buddhist practice, but 
is superior to the practice of Hinayana. It is a superior form of 
practice because it points to the ultimate nature of all 
phenomena. Also a very great bodhisattva taught it, which is 
another reason for describing it by the qualifier "ultimate." 
Finally, the word "ultimate" is in the title because the 
Uttaratantra explains absolute truth and thus functions as a 
bridge between the sutras and the tantras. 
The last word "tan chi/' or "shastra" in Sanskrit literally 
means "a teaching which brings remedy'' or a remedial teaching. 
These teachings, which are an elucidation of the Buddha's 
teachings, constitute a remedy for all the defilements. In this 
way, they enable one to abandon the suffering 11 of the three 
realms of existence.12 
The names of Buddhist works generally contain an analogy 
or an example of its subject matter. Here the name "gyu" refers 
to the subject matter of the work, which is the essence of 
Buddhahood. This continuity refers both to the subject matter 
and also to the function of the work. The function of this work 
is to help beings enter the Mahayana path. 
The Salutation 
Homage to all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. 
The salutation to the Buddhas by the translator is as follows: 
"Homage to all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas." The Tibetan 
word for Buddha is sang gye. These syllables indicate that the 
Buddha possesses two qualities: the quality of gurity because 
he has eliminated all negative impurities and the quality of 
158 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
realization because once the impurities are gone, the full 
understanding of all phenomena manifests. The first syllable 
sang means "totally purified" or "awakened," awakened from 
the sleep of ignorance. A Buddha has completely eliminated 
all impurities; all the things that had to be removed have been 
remoyed. The second part of the word gye means "fully 
blossomed" referring to the fact that once every obscuration 
has been fully removed, . the pure intelligence of a Buddha 
comprehends the nature of all phenomena with full luminous 
clarity. This word gye is also used to describe what happens to a 
lotus flower when it opens up completely. So the word sang 
gye, in this context, means awakened and fully blossomed. 
The next word in the salutation is "bodhisattvas" or chang 
chub sem pa. This word was translated from the Sanskrit into 
four Tibetan syllables. The literal meaning of"this term is "those 
who have enough cpurage to strive for enlightenment." The 
first word is chang chub or "enlightenment," which is composed 
of the first syllable chang, which means "completely purified." 
This has essentially the same meaning as sang in Tibetan. It 
means purified of all ignorance. The second syllable chub means 
"internalized" or "assimilated." This means that once all the 
obscurations have been removed, all knowledge has been 
realized. The Tibetan word chang chub is the word for 
''enlightenment" in general, but in this particular context it is 
the name for bodhisattvas. It means "almost completely 
purified" or "has almost completely assimilated the meaning 
of everything." The second word sem pa means "those who have 
the courage to embark on the path of enlightenment." 
Therefore, in the salutation, the translators prostrate to the 
Buddhas and bodhisattvas in order to receive the blessings of 
the lineage, which will enable their work to be accomplished 
properly and without difficulties. 
Introduction to the Text 159 
Divisions of the Commentary 
Following the salutation, the text by Maitreya begins. 
Buddhist commentaries usually present the work in three main 
divisions. Each chapter begins with one verse which is a 
condensed summary of the whole chapter, followed by a set 
of verses giving detailed explanations of each of the points 
mentioned in the first part, and a third set recapitulating the 
meaning of the verses. 
This first introductory section has three parts. The first 
verse describes the work as composed of seven points called 
"indestructible" or vajra points because, like a vajra, they are 
very profound. The second verse indicates that this work is 
connected with the sutras and is based on Buddha's teachings. 
The third verse is an explanation of the order of the seven 
vajra points. 
As mentioned, all beings want to find sorrl.e kind of 
happiness and eliminate their difficulties. In this respect 
everyone is the same. The difference between individuals lies 
in the way in which they go about attaining this happiness. 
Some people seek material happiness and some try to find 
happiness through the dharma. Those who pursue worldly 
happiness might believe happiness will come to them by 
achieving fame or success or wealth. If they try to achieve 
happiness in this way, they will not be successful. The only 
way to find true happiness is to achieve Buddhahood. When 
one is a Buddha, all the negative tendencies that could create 
unhappiness have been relinquished and everything that is to 
be realized has been realized. Only then can eternal happiness 
be achieved. All other attempts will bring only temporary 
happiness. For this reason, the first points examined in the 
Uttaratantra relate to that goal, the attainment ofBuddhahood. 
160 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Outline of the Work 
1.13 The entire body of this treatise can be condensed 
into the following seven vajra abodes:14 
Buddha, dharma, sangha, Buddha-nature, 
enlightenment, qualities and Buddha-activity. 
The first three points of the Uttaratantra relate to the Buddha, 
the dharma, and the sangha because these three enable us to 
reach the goal of enlightenment. * The first vajra topic is the Buddha who shows the way 
to enlightenment. * The second vajra topic is the dharma which are the 
teachings given by the Buddha and which show us how to attain 
our goal. * The third vajra topic is the sangha, or our companions 
on the path, who help keep us from wandering off of the path. 
These three vajra points are external factors. We also need 
something within oursel£ If we do not possess anything within 
that makes it possible to reach enlightenment, we cannot do so. * Therefore the fourth vajra topic is the essence of 
Buddhahood, called Buddha-essence, which is present in all 
beings. 
Once we know that Buddha-essence is present in the mind 
of all beings, we know that whoever strives for enlightenment 
can attain it. We cannot say that this person can reach 
Buddhahood but that some other person cannot because all 
possess the seed of enlightenment. However, it is not enough 
to possess the seed of enlightenment; we must cultivate that 
seed in such a way that it develops fully into Buddhahood. * In order to achieve this goal, we must exert ourselves 
to remove all impurities. This effort is the fifth vajra topic -
enlightenment. 
Introduction to the Text 161 
* The good qualities achieved after obtaining 
enlightenment make up the sixth vajra topic. 
Why is it important to reach enlightenment? It is important 
because enlightenment is the state in which all of our qualities 
reach ultimate fulfillment, as do all of the perfect qualities that 
are not just of value for oneself, but automatically have great 
value for all other beings that are trapped in conditioned 
existence. * The seventh and last vajra point, then, is the activity of 
a Buddha. This activity, which benefits all other sentient beings, 
flows naturally from Buddhahood. 
Connection to the Sutras 
2. These are in a natural order and one should know 
the first three abodes to be deriving from the introductory 
and the latter four from the Wise and Victors' Qualities 
chapters of the Dharanirajesvarasutra 
These seven vajra points were not arbitrarily concocted by 
Maitreya, but were taught by the Buddha in the sutras. The· 
Buddha explained this subject as seven vajra points because 
there is an inner connection between them, between their 
intrinsic characteristics. The Buddha taught this relationship 
at the request of King Ishvara in the Dharanirajesvara sutra. In 
the introductory chapter of that sutra there is a teaching on 
the Three Jewels (the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha). 
The Buddha is shown to be the one who has reached full 
realization of the true nature of all phenomena. From this 
realization springs the dharma. Once this teaching concerning 
the Buddha has been preserved, individuals begin to accompany 
162 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the Buddha, learn his teachings, and train their mind. They 
become the sangha. 
The other four vajra points are explained in the 
Dharanirajesvara sutra, beginning with an explanation of the 
way in which bodhisattvas can learn to purify the obstacles 
blocking the way to realization. Bodhisattvas must purify 
emotional afflictions and the dualistic thinking which block 
true wisdom. 15 The sutra explains the ways in which one can 
eliminate these obscurations. If the essence of Buddhahood is 
purified, it,can then manifest. This sutra explains sixty different 
ways in which the essence of Buddhahood can be purified and 
made manifest. The fifth vajra point, enlightenment, is 
introduced by explaining the sixteen aspects of the compassion 
of a bodhisattva. When Buddhahood is attained, all of the 
qualities inherent in enlightened mind are revealed, such as 
the ten powers of the Buddha and the four fearlessnesses. The 
sixth vajra point enumerates the qualities of enlightenment. 
The seventh vajra point explains the activity of the Buddha or 
the natural" outflow of the activities ofBuddhahood. The seven 
vajra points are arranged in this particular order so as to indicate 
the intimate connection between them. The sey:en vajra points 
are also taught in several other sutras, but there is no other 
sutra in which the sequence and the connection between the 
points is discussed. 
The Order of the Vttjra Points 
3. From the Buddha comes the dharma, 
from the dharma comes the realized sangha, 
from the sangha, the presence of the jnana nature, 
the essence. 
Ultimately, when this jnana has been made manifest, 
Introduction to the. Text 163 
there will be supreme enlightenment, powers and so forth, 
endowed with every ability to accomplish 
the good for each and everyone. 
When the Buddha enters the world, he is the root of all the 
good qualities, of all the forms of true happiness. The first step 
in the logic of the seven vajra points must be the Buddha from 
whom all the good qualities and happiness spring. Once a 
Buddha has entered the world in order to help other beings, he 
turns the wheel of dharma. From the Buddha springs the 
dharma. Once the dharma has been taught, it spreads because 
in this way beings become ready to understand the dharma. 
They practice it according to their ability and the aspect of the 
path that suits them. By practicing on the path, these beings 
then develop signs of realization and become known as the 
"realized sangha." This is the third vajra point. 
When the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha have come 
) 
into being, the possibility that Buddha-essence can be realized 
also exists. Although everyone possesses Buddha-essence from 
the beginning of time, the presence of the Three Jewels makes 
it possible for individuals to learn about Buddhahood and in 
this way they can begin to manifest Buddha-essence. They learn 
how to purify the obscurations that hide it. Gradually this 
essence ofBuddhahood is more and more clearly revealed until 
wisdom (Skt. jnana) manifests completely. In order for this to 
occur, four conditions must be present: the external conditions 
of the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha and the inner 
condition, which is the Buddha-essence within our own mind. 
When this combination of external and internal conditions is 
present, it is possible to remove all the impurities that obscure 
the essence of Buddhahood. Once all of these impurities have 
been removed, one achieves Buddhahood, and Buddhahood is 
the connection between the fourth and the fifth vajra points. 
164 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Once Buddhahood is achieved, the qualities of enlightened 
mind emerge. In the sixth vajra point, these qualities are 
explained. When Buddhahood is achieved, not only are our 
own qualities fulfilled in a powerful way, but also the emergence 
of Buddha-essence becomes very useful to others. The qualities 
of enlightenment are related to both mind and body. The 
qualities of the body will be explained in terms of the two kayas 
of the Buddha: nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya. The qualities 
of the mind are all the qualities of the dharmakaya. 
Once the qualities ofBuddhahood are present, great benefit 
for all other beings automatically springs from them. The 
seventh vajra point concerns the activities of Buddhahood 
because from these qualities emerge the activities of the Buddha, 
which benefits all beings. This activity is totally effortless, 
continuing until samsara has been completely eliminated. 
The above· three verses were an explanation of the central 
structure of the text which in Tibetan is referred to as the "body" 
of the text. What follows are the different parts or what Tibetan 
scholars call the "limbs" of the text. The detailed explanation 
of the seven vajra points is actually divided into two sections: 
the goal one is aiming for, which covers the fi.rst three vajra 
points plus a summary, and the tools for reaching 
c;:nlightenment, which comprise the remaining four vajra points. 
THE. BUDDHA 
Tbe l'irst Vajra Poi11t 165 
THE EXPLANATION of the Buddha is divided into three 
sections: a description of Buddhahood in the salutation, 
the qualities of the Buddhas, and a more detailed explanation 
of these qualities. 
The Salutation 
4. I bow down to the beginningless, centerless and infinite, 
to perfect peace, Buddha, 
folly self-awakened and self-blossomed which, 
once purified and developed, 
shows the fearless, permanent path, 
to bring realization to those with no realization 
and which, wielding the supreme sword and vajra 
of knowledge and compassionate love 
hews down the seedlings of sufferings 
166 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
and destroys the walls of doubt 
surrounded by the dense forests of mistaken views. 
The Buddha Shakyamuni is described in this salutation. A 
Buddha is someone who has reached total fulfillment. 
Buddhahood is the ultimate fulfillment for oneself because it 
is free from all suffering and all possibility of suffering. If one 
is a Buddha, there is no longer any fear, any worry, or any doubt 
that suffering will never return. When Buddhahood has been 
achieved, one does not selfishly enjoy it just for oneself but 
from this Buddhahood springs activity that spontaneously 
benefits all other beings. 
The salutation is offered in the form, "I bow down ... " This 
is followed by a list of the six qualities of Buddhahood: 
~ it is uncreated, 
~ it is peace, 
~ it relies on no external conditions, 
~ it is perfect knowledge, 
~ compassionate love and 
~ has the power to help. 
The first three qualities of the Buddha are connected to what 
is valuable for oneself. The last three qualities are connected to 
what will benefit others. 
The first quality ofBuddhahood is that it is uncreated. It is 
not composed of anything. The text says the Buddha is 
beginningless, centerless, and infinite. Beginningless means 
there is no birth or origination of the Buddha. Centerless means 
there is no place where the Buddha abides. Infinite means there 
is no death, no interruption of the Buddha. Birth, a place of 
abiding, and an end, imply a change of condition. If there were 
a change, even if one were happy initially, this happiness could 
eventually become suffering. Change automatically implies 
impermanence and impermanence implies suffering. Being 
The Buddha -The First Vajra Point 167 
uncreated, the Buddha doesn't belong to conditioned 
phenomena, which are subject to change. 
The second quality ofBuddhahood is peace or equanimity, 
which implies the spontaneous presence of everything 
beneficial. This peace means that all conceptual agitation has 
totally ended. Because one is constantly agitated by millions of 
thoughts, the mind is never peaceful. We seem to need to exert 
effort all the time because everything appears to be cfifficult. 
Whatever one wants is not available because there is always 
some obstruction. This creates mental pain and physical 
difficulties. One is always struggling to do things not once, 
but again and again. However, the Buddha with this peace of 
mind does not need to make any effort. Everything happens 
spontaneously and effortlessly. 
The third quality of Buddhahood is that it does not rely 
on any external conditions or set of conditions. The essence of 
Buddhahood is inherent. One cannot give Buddhahood to 
anyone else. In the same way one cannot depend upon 
something outside of oneself in order to become enlightened. 
Buddhahood realizes itself and has nothing to do with an 
external process. 
The above three qualities are related to what is valuable for 
oneself. From the presence of these qualities springs the next 
three qualities that have value for .others. When Buddhahood. 
is achieved, one has gone beyond suffering and all the causes of 
suffering. In other words, one is awakened from ignorance. 
This is the achievement of ultimate happiness when the 
complete understanding of the nature of all phenomena 
unfolds, which is the full blossoming of jnana, the fourth 
quality. When this happens, a Buddha has the power to help 
others, to reveal the fearless path. A Buddha is able to do this 
because he or she posses two qualities: the complete 
understanding of the nature of all phenomena and 
168 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
compassionate love that creates a desire to share this knowledge 
with others. 
Compassion and knowledge, the fifth and sixth qualities, 
are compared to a sword and a vajra. The sword cuts through 
all suffering. The vajra destroys the wall of doubts that is 
surrounded by the thicket of wrong views. The Buddha uses 
compassion and knowledge to rid beings of their suffering, 
wrong views, and misunderstandings. The three qualities that 
enable a Buddha to benefit other beings, then, are wisdom, 
compassion, and the power to be genuinely helpful. 
The concise explanation of the qualities of the Buddha is 
that taken together they create perfect fulfillment for oneself 
and others. The longer account involves a detailed explanation 
of the six qualities listed above. The most complete account 
includes these six qualities and two more, which are the way in 
which Buddhahood is valuable for oneself and also benefits 
others. 16 It is beneficial for the Buddhist practitioner to learn 
these, eight qualities and to keep them in mind, rather than 
simply reading about them in the text. 
Qualities of the Buddha 
5. Buddhahood is endowed with two-fold value. 
It is uncreated, spontaneous and 
not to be realized through external causes. 
It possesses knowledge, compassionate love and ability. 
* The first quality of the Buddha is that it is "uncreated" 
(Tib. du ma che) which also means "unconditioned" in Tibetan. 
One part of the Tibetan word means "gathered" or "gathered 
together." What are gathered together are the many different 
causal conditions of which phenomena are constituted. For 
The Buddha -The First Vtzjra Point 169 
example, when growing a flower, we first need the seed which 
is the basic cause of the existence of the flower. We also need a 
whole set of secondary conditions such as water, fertilizer, and 
heat which makes growth of the flower possible. The developed 
flower therefore is not "unconditioned" because it is a result of 
the seed and all the factors needed for its growth. We may ask 
what is wrong with something being created from a composite 
of many different things. The problem is that if one of the 
factors is lacking, the object will not develop. For instance, if 
water is lacking, the flower will wither and die or, if heat is 
lacking, the flower will not bloom. The essence ofBuddhahood, 
on the other hand, is not created by different causes or 
conditions. The essence ofBuddhahood is present in the mind 
of all beings from the beginning. Because it is not created, the 
nature of Buddhahood is changeless. * The second quality of the Buddha is peace or 
spontaneous presence. From Buddhahood, all of the other good 
qualities manifest spontaneously. This spontaneity occurs with 
the absence of effort. All of the qualities of the Buddha and the 
qualities of the purity of the dharmakaya and form kayas are 
inherently present and need not be modified or developed in 
any way. They have always been present. * The third quality is that the realization ofBuddhahood 
does not depend on external conditions. If this realization were 
to depend upon something external, it would be controlled by 
that external something. The Buddha has no need to rely on 
an external object or condition. One may ask, "What realizes 
Buddhahood?" It is the jnana, the aspect of the. pure intelligence 
of the mind. 17 This jnana recognizes itself without the 
introduction of any outside factor. Enlightenment becomes a 
process in which jnana recognizes its own nature. 
The next three qualities are associated with that which is 
) valuable to others. 
170 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
$-The fourth quality is perfect knowledge. If one reveals 
the path to others, one needs to understand it oneself, otherwise 
there is nothing to reveal. This means that the understanding 
of the Buddha cannot be partial. A Buddha must continuously 
perceive the true nature of all phenomena, not just glimpse it. 
The perfect knowledge of the Buddha has two aspects: the 
knowledge of the true nature of phenomena and the perception 
of its multitude and variety. 
$-The fifth quality is compassionate love. If Buddhas 
understood the true nature of phenomena, but had no 
compassion, they would keep this knowledge to themselves. A 
Buddha is endowed with perfect compassion quite similar to, 
but stronger than, the love of a mother for her only child. This 
love includes the desire to free others from suffering and to 
enable them to be happy. A Buddha is endowed with the most 
perfect form of compassion which enables him or her to be 
genuinely helpful to other beings.' 
$-This sixth quality is the power to help others. The 
Buddha posses perfect knowledge and compassion, but these 
two qualities will not benefit beings if this sixth quality is 
lacking. In order to remove all suffering and the cause of 
suffering, one must have the power to do so. The Buddha 
possesses this ability to enable others to free themselves from 
suffering and the causes of their suffering with compassion and 
knowledge. With these a Buddha can cut through the seeds of 
suffering and destroy the wall of doubts. 
Summary of the Qualities 
6 It is the uncreated because its nature 
is without beginning, middle, or end. 
It is said to be spontaneity since it is peace, 
possession of the dharmakaya. 
The Buddha- The First Vajra Point 171 
The first quality of Buddhahood is that it is uncreated. If 
something has a beginning, an intermediate state in which it 
abides, and an end when it disintegrates, then it possesses the 
three marks of existence, of birth, life, and death, which are 
the characteristics of composite things. Buddhahood is not 
created because it is present from the beginning in the mind of 
all beings. Because Buddhahood never ceases, it continually 
provides help to beings as long as samsara continues. Though 
Buddhahood is present, it cannot be said to abide in the way 
that things are said to exist, as solid entities. Its essence is 
emptiness and its nature is luminous clarity. It is therefore a 
union of voidness and luminous clarity. 
The second quality ofBuddhahood is spontaneous presence 
because it is peace and it possesses the dharmakaya. By nature 
Buddhas are peaceful because they have no impulse to harm 
anything. They have none of the emotions that are the result 
of desire, none of the emotions that would produce effort and 
striving because effort and striving as well as conceptual 
manipulation .have been purified and have disappeared. The 
Buddha is peaceful, manifesting the nature of the dharmakaya 
that is free of the need for any mental effort or conceptual 
creation. This is why the Buddha is said to be spontaneous and 
manifest the spontaneous presence of all the good qualities. 
7. Its realization is not due to any external cause 
since it has to be realized through pure apperception. 
It is knowledge since it has realization of these three. 
It is great compassionate love because it shows the way. 
The third quality of Buddhahood is that it is not realized by 
relying on external conditions. We do not need to depend on 
anything external in order to realize Buddhahood. This does 
not mean that at the beginning of the path, we do not need 
172 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
help to learn how to practice. At the beginning of the path 
we cannot see this pure essence of Buddhahood in all beings. 
For this reason we must rely on external sources. At the 
moment of realization, however, we cannot rely on anyone 
or anything else; we must rely on jnana, which is inherently 
present in the mind. When the impurities masking jnana have 
been removed, the strong luminous clarity of this jnana is 
present. It recognizes itself. 
All beings possess the essence of Buddhahood, but they do 
not realize that they do therefore they need help to reach 
Buddhahood. Through their perfect knowledge, the fourth 
quality, Buddhas know how to help them. Besides this 
knowledge of how to be genuinely helpful, Buddhas possess 
compassion, the fifth quality, that sees the agony beings 
encounter again anc:l again. This compassion sees the need to 
help beings reach Buddhahood, which is the only way to truly 
liberate them. 
8. It is ability because it removes 
suffering and defilements by jnana and compassion. 
Through these first three there is value for oneself 
and through the latter three there is value for others. 
The sixth quality is that the Buddha has the power to help 
remove the suffering and all the defilements of beings that cause 
their suffering. So the Buddha sees the need to help others, 
knows how to help them, and has the ability to do so.

THE DHARMA 
Tbe Secon~ Vajra Point 175 
THE FIRST VAJRA POINT enumerates the eight qualities of the 
Buddha. When Buddhahood is achieved, Buddhas 
spontaneously help beings reach enlightenment. Bow do they 
do this? Do Buddhas give sentient beings their blessings where 
upon these beings are immediately transported into 
Buddhahood? This is not the way Buddhas help beings. They 
reveal the path of enlightenment to beings and help them by 
teaching the dharma, which is the path to enlightenment. For 
this reason, the dharma is the second varja point. 
The word "dharma'' can mean two different things: any 
true statement such as the sky is blue or the body of teachings 
passed on by the Shakyamuni Buddha to his disciples. This 
body of teachings includes the actual words of the Buddha and 
also the explanatory texts (Skt. shastras), which were written by 
others to explain the Buddha's words. The actual words of the 
Buddha are divided into three "baskets" called the Tripitaka. 
176 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The first basket includes the Vinaya teachings, which were 
intended to free one from attachment. The second basket is 
the collection of sutr.a teachings, which are intended to free 
·one from aggression. The third encompasses the Abhidharma 
teachings, which are intended to free one from ignorance. These 
three baskets contain the 84,000 different aspects of the dharma 
taught directly by the Shakyamuni Buddha and explained by 
his students. 18 
The word "dharma" is most frequently used to mean 
"teaching.~' In the Uttaratantra, however, "dharma'' refers to 
the dharma of realization. This use of "dharma'' refers to that 
which has the ability to eliminate all defilements and bring 
about the full fruition of jnana (the highest and purest form of 
knowledge and intelligence). The dharma of realization is the 
direct result of practicing the dharma, which is the body of the 
teachings. For instance, the dharma of realization of all the 
qualities that are described in the body of teachings. The dharma 
of the explicit teachings is only an indirect tool used to acquire 
the enlightened qualities, whereas all the qualities of purity 
and realization can be directly attained through the dharma of 
realization. In the Uttaratantra the word "dharma" will 
principally be used in its ultimate sense as it refers to the 
realization of these qualities. 
The dharma of realization has two aspects: 
~ the truth of cessation and 
~ the truth of the path. 
The truth of cessation is that it is possible to achieve total 
freedom from bondage. The Tibetan word for bondage is ching 
wa, literally meaning "attachment" or "attached." Sometimes 
this word "bondage" refers to the defilements related just to 
attachment. But in this text the word "bondage" is to signify 
all obscurations -the defilements of emotions and the 
obscurations that are the result of dualistic thinking. The truth 
The Dharma -The Second Vtzjra Point 177 
of cessation is that it is possible to achieve freedom from both 
of these obscurations. One achieves this form of liberation when 
one is free from both kinds of defilements. The freedom from 
bondage is achieved by the practice of the path out of which 
jnana develops. When this knowledge is born, it is possible to 
reach the truth of cessation. 
The Salutation 
9. I bow down to the sun of dharma, 
which is neither existence nor non-existence 
nor a combination of existence and non-existence, 
nor something other than existence and non-existence: 
the unexaminable, beyond all verbal definition, 
self-cognizant, peace, 
stainless, brilliant with the light ofjnana, 
which completely destroys craving for 
aversion to or dullness towards mental objects. 
The truth of cessation possesses three qualities: 
~ inconceivability, 
~ non-duality and 
~ non-conceptuality. 
The truth of the path possesses three qualities: 
~ purity, 
~ luminous clarity and 
~ remedy. 
When the two truths are added to these six qualities, the dharma 
of realization is fully defined by the resulting eight qualities. 
The first description of the dharma appears in the salutation, 
"I bow down to the sun of dharma." The dharma is compared 
to the sun because when the sun rises, the light of the sun 
178 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
dispels all darkness by shining everywhere spontaneously. 
Likewise, when one has a direct realization of the dharma, all 
the defilements and obscurations are completely dispelled. 
The first three qualities are related to the truth of cessation 
and the true nature of phenomena. 
The first quality of the "dharma of realization" is that it is 
inconceivable because phenomena are devoid of solid reality. 
When one hears this one should not fall into the extreme of 
nihilism by thinking "if it is void, then nothing at all has any 
significance" and begin believing that karma does not apply 
and that there is no difference between a good and a bad action. 
To counteract this nihilism, the text states that emptiness (Skt. 
shunyata) is not non-existence. On the relative level, whatever 
appears to us, even though it is an illusion, is there and our 
actions do have an effect. However, on the absolute level the 
Buddha kayas manifest as the jnana of the Buddhas. This 
presence of the Buddha kayas and the validity of karma on 
the relative level are apprehended by the self-cognizant jnana. 
On the relative level, everything manifests, but all of these 
phenomena have never had any actual reality because they 
are by nature empty. By understanding emptiness, one can 
avoid the related danger, the belief in solid existence, the belief 
in eternarism. 19 
The true nature of phenomena cannot be described as either 
(1) existing or (2) lacking existence. Nor can phenomena be 
said (3) both to exist and to lack existence. This is logically 
impossible because existence and non-existence cannot occur 
simultaneously. Neither can the true nature of phenomena be 
said to be ( 4) something other than existence and non-existence. 
Again this is impossible. If phenomena had existed in the first 
place, one might be able to claim that, in some way, they did 
not exist. However, since what appears does not exist at all, it 
cannot be said to exist in one way but not in another. This 
The Dharma -The Second Vajra Point 179 
argument shows that the true nature of phenomena is free from 
the reasoning of these four extremes and the true nature is free 
from the complication of our rational thinking. 
An object can be defined verbally. However, the very subtle 
true nature of phenomena cannot be so defined, it is beyond 
any verbal definition. It is said in many texts that the true nature 
of things is ineffable (impossible to comprehend); it is beyond 
words, beyond thoughts and beyond definition. Then how can 
it be understood? First, it is possible to gain an indirect 
understanding through logical analysis. Once this indirect 
knowledge has been obtained, meditation provides a direct 
understanding. This direct understanding originates out of the 
self-cognizant aspect of intelligence. All phenomena are devoid 
of any substantial reality but this emptiness is not simply an 
empty space. If it were an empty space, that space would be 
blank. The emptiness of the mind, on the other hand, is the 
dharmadhatu 20 which is the space of the true nature of things 
and which possesses a very vivid luminous clarity. Within this 
luminous clarity, everything manifests. Manifestation can 
appear in pure and impure form. Impurity produces illusory 
forms. When purity is undisturbed, manifestation will appear 
in pure forms and the pure lands of the Buddha/ 1 The true 
nature of phenomena is the essence of emptiness and its nature 
is luminous clarity. This nature can be called self-cognizant 
jnana. When the jnana knows itself, it knows the true nature 
of phenomena. Therefore the text says that this essence of 
Buddhahood "is neither existence nor non-existence." 
In the salutation, the next word is "peace." Peace signifies 
that all karma and all defilements have been pacified. This one 
word "peace," encompasses the other two qualities of the truth 
of cessation. The second quality is non-duality and the third is 
freedom from concept. Everything that comes before the word 
peace refers to the fact that it is inconceivable. 
180 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The next three qualities are related to the truth of the path. 
The first quality is the stain1essness of purity. There are 
two kinds of obscurations to be purified in the practice of the 
path: the emotional aspect of the defilements and the 
obscurations of dualistic knowledge. Once all the obscurations 
have been removed, the sun ofjnana, which is inherently present 
in the mind of all beings, can shine through in all of its 
brilliance. The word "brilliant" refers to the light of jnana. It 
indicates the second quality, which is luminous clarity. Once 
the obscurations have been removed, the total luminous clarity 
of knowledge emerges because the sun of jnana has been freed 
of the clouds. 
The third quality is that the dharma of realization acts as a 
remedy for the defilements of attachment, aggression and 
confusion or ignorance. When the sun ofjnana has been liberated 
from its clouds, it dispels all negativity, acting as a remedy. This 
is why in the phrase, the truth of the path is compared to the sun 
in, "I bow down to the sun of dharma." The sun, free from clouds, 
is pure. Its brilliance sheds light everywhere and its qualities 
remedy darkness. Now in more detail: 
Context 
10. The dharma is that imbued with 
the intrinsic characteristics of the two truths: 
that which is and that which causes freedom from bondage. 
Inconceivable, not two and concept-free, 
Purity, clarity and the remedy. 
The truth of cessation is represented by the achievement of 
realizing the truth of phenomen~. 
The Dharma -The Second Vajra Point 181 
0 This true nature has the quality of being inconceivable, 
the first quality. "Inconceivable" means that the nature of things 
is beyond the four conceptual extremes; it is neither existent, 
non-existent, both or neither. It is "inconceivable" in terms of 
using words. 
0 The second quality that describes the dharma of 
realization is that it is non-dual, which means that it is free of 
the defilements and the impurities ofkarma. 22 Karma literally 
means "action" and refers 'to all positive and negative actions. 23 
These actions are always tainted by defilements and dualistic 
thought. Even when we engage in positive actions, these actions 
are still tainted in some subtle way. For instance, we may want 
something in return for the good action and therefore it will 
still be a cause for rebirth. If we perform good actions, they 
will produce good results and lead to a higher rebirth in samsara. 
But they will still result in samsaric rebirth. The defilements 
are the root of ego and the belief in the existence of the self. If 
karma and defilements are present, samara is present. 24 The 
dharma of realization is free from both karma and defilements 
and therefore it is called non-dual. 
0 The third quality of the truth of cessation is that it is 
non-conceptual. It is totally free from concepts. Whenever there 
is conceptual activity it is possible for incorrect ideas to arise, 
incorrect ideas that contradict the actual nature of things. These 
incorrect ideas generate negative actions and their related 
defilements. Negative actions and the defilements in turn lead 
to a rebirth in samsara. These concepts then are the root of 
samsara. The truth of cessation does not include any of these 
ideas that will give rise to samsara. 
0 The first quality relating to the truth of the path is 
stainlessness or purity. The fact that the dharma of realization 
is said to be stainless means that it is free from both the stains 
of the defilements and from dualism. The dharma of the truth 
182 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
of the path is completely free from these impurities. Even 
though impurities may appear, these impurities are only 
temporarily present and are not really part of the dharma. The 
dharma by nature has never been soiled or polluted in any way. 
It is similar to pure gold that may occasionally be tarnished, 
but that tarnish is not an inherent part of the gold. It is only a 
temporary condition that can be eliminated. Similarly, there 
may be clouds in the sky, but clouds are not an inherent part of 
the nature of the air, they are just incidental, passing through 
the sky. In the same way, the impurities of karma, defilements 
and dualistic knowledge, are just fleeting phenomena happening 
in the mind and not an integral part of dharma. 
$ The second quality is luminous clarity. When the truth 
of the path has been completely realized, a brilliance dawns 
that lights up all of the appearances of relative reality very 
vividly. The true nature of phenomena appears, which is 
illuminated within this luminous clarity. Both the relative and 
absolute aspect of phenomena can be directly expressed in 
this way. When the truth of the path has been achieved, it is 
like a light that lights up both the relative and absolute aspect 
of phenomena. 25 
$ The third quality is that of being a remedy. The 
realization of the qualities of purity and luminous clarity 
eliminate the defilements that are the three poisons: attachment, 
aggression, and ignorance. Dharma is inherently free from the 
causes of bondage. Freedom fro'm bondage is related to the 
truth of cessation. Bondage is caused by all of the emotional 
negativities, the obscurations of dualistic conceptualization and 
the subconscious traces that remain after the coarser impurities 
have been removed. These. obscurations bind one to samsara 
and they do not disappear by themselves. One must apply a 
remedy to the obscurations. 
The Dharma -The Second Vajra Point 183 
If one practices the path, beginning with the path of 
accumulation, continuing through the path of application and 
the other paths (seeing and cultivation), eventually one attains 
Buddhahood. The truth of the path frees one from bondage. 26 
When bondage has been eliminated, one has reached the truth 
of cessation. Therefore, the dharma can be said to be that which 
manifests the qualities of the truth of cessation and the truth 
of the path. 
Dharma possesses two aspects -the dharma of teaching 
and the dharma of realization. When one takes refuge, one 
must realize there are two aspects of refuge- the refuge that is 
a causal condition leading one to enlightenment and the refuge 
that is the result after one has achieved this state. The refuge of 
cause is taken at the very beginning of the path by ordinary 
beings, taking refuge in the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha. 
At this point, individuals do not know very much about the 
path that leads to Buddhahood and therefore they need to rely 
on a guide who can reveal this path. One takes refuge in the 
dharma as the teachings of the Buddha, one takes refuge in the 
sangha as companions on the path. As an ordinary being one 
takes refuge in the Buddha who is outside oneself, the dharma 
that is not one's personal realization, and the sangha composed 
of beings that have developed their own realization. In· the 
beginning, one takes refuge in what has been realized by other 
beings and one studies the Tripitaka as the dharma. 
In the Uttaratantra, on the other hand, refuge is that of 
fruition. One first takes refuge in the Three Jewels as the cause 
for one's future enlightenment. When one takes refuge in the 
sangha, one becomes part of the sangha. Next, if one practices 
and eliminates the obscurations and impurities 1 the true 
qualities of dharma become evident. The dharma of realization 
then manifests when one takes refuge in the dharma, it is not 
external but has become internalized. Eventually one becomes 
184 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
a Buddha and does not rely on anything external any more. 
One becomes one's own refuge. At the fruition level one takes 
refuge in the dharma of realization rather than in the dharma 
as. a teaching and becomes the realized sangha. The Uttaratantra 
refers to the truth of the path that leads to the truth of cessation 
and to dharma as realization. 
How the Qualities are Connected to the Truths 
11. 'Freedom from bondage' applies to 
the truth of cessation and the truth of the path. 
Each of these has qualities three, for each, respectively: 
The truth of cessation is freedom from bondage because there 
is nothing more to relinquish. The truth of the path frees one 
from bondage. The truth of cessation possesses the qualities of 
inconce~vability, non-duality and non-conceptuality. The truth 
of the path possesses the qualities of purity, luminous clarity 
and remedy. So the six qualities are contained in the two truths. 
How the Qualities are Connected to the Salutation 
12. It is inconceivable {because it cannot be examined by 
thought, 
it is inexpressible and it is the knowledge of the realized), 
without the two and concept-free, peace. 
It is purity and so forth, these three being like the sun. 
Asanga, in the Uttaratantra, explains these qualities three times 
to insure they are understood. First, he explains these qualities 
in the salutation (verse 9). Then in the second verse (10) he 
presents a more detailed explanation. In the third verse (11), 
The Dharma -The Second ~jra Point 185 
he connects the various qualities with praise. Here in the fourth 
verse (12), the first quality of the truth of cessation is presented 
as inconceivable, becau~e it is beyond the grasp of intellect: 
when one thinks about this truth, one cannot claim it is like 
this or that or give it a color or definition. Secondly, it is beyond 
the grasp of speech: it cannot be expressed, it cannot be 
described in words; one cannot say it is like this or like that. 
Thirdly, it is inconceivable because it cannot be grasped by the 
understanding of an ordinary person. In the salutation to the 
dharma it states that the truth of cessation is self-cognizant 
and known only to the deeply realized. When one is practicing 
on the path, one hears about this truth, then reflects on it, and 
finally one meditates on what has been learned. When all 
impurities have been removed through meditation, one will 
reacH. the state of the realized ones, the level of the bodhisattvas, 
when one sees the true nature of phenomena directly without 
any distortion. Because the truth of cessation cannot be directly 
perceived by a worldly mind, only when one reaches the state 
of the realized ones will one have direct experience of the truth 
of cessation. 
The second and third qualities, those of peace, are inherent 
in the true nature of phenomena, which is endowed with 
twofold purity. This peace is present because all forms of 
suffering have been removed when karma and the defilements 
have been relinquished. For this reason the first meaning of 
peace is that suffering has been pacified. Secondly, peace is 
completely free from anything rough and coarse or harsh. 
Thirdly, the quality is peace because it is non-dual or non­
conceptual, being free from the coarseness of thoughts. 
Regarding the qualities of the truth of the path, purity, the 
first quality, is a natural feature of realization because the twofold 
obscurations have been removed. When purity is present, the 
second quality, luminous clarity is present as well, and once 
186 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
purity and luminous clarity manifest in realization the power 
to remedy the three poisons emerges, the third quality. In the 
salutation this quality is explained by using the example of the 
sun. The sun is by nature very pure, and because of this purity, 
it dispels all forms of darkness. In the same way, realization of 
the truth of,the path eliminates obscurations, defilements and 
dualistic knowledge, bringing about the recognition of the 
natural purity of the nature of phenomena.

THE SANGHA 
Tbe Tbiro Vajra Point 187 
IN THE UTTARATANTRA the sangha is the realized sangha, the 
Mahayana sangha. The Tibetan word for "sangha'' is gendun. 
The first syllable gen means "virtue" and the second dun means 
"aspiration." The gendun are those aspiring to virtue. There are 
two types of sangha- the sangha of ordinary beings and those 
of realized beings. Ordinary beings have not reached a state of 
realization and do not have a direct understanding of the truth 
because their understanding is still obscured by the defilements. 
However, they have a strong desire to do what is beneficial. 
The sangha of ordinary beings is composed of both lay people 
and the ordained. It is possible to follow the Buddhist path 
without being ordained by taking refuge and taking any of the 
levels of the precepts. At the refuge ceremony one takes refuge 
in the Three Jewels, which represents ordinary refuge. This level 
of refuge is also taken by the realized sangha. In the refuge 
ceremony there is no distinction among those who take refuge. 
188 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The sangha are composed of friends and companions who help 
us on the path and make sure that we do not go astray. The 
Uttaratantra, however, describes fruition refuge, which is the 
ultimate refuge. This fruition refuge embraces the will to go 
beyond the state of ordinary beings. In the context of the 
Mahayana path this means achieving Buddhahood. These 
sangha are called the realized sangha. 
The Salutation 
13. I bow down to those whose mind is no longer obscured, 
the deeply realized who have jnana's perception, 
awareness of the total purity present in limitless beings. 
As the true nature of mind is lucid clarity, 
they see the defilements to be without essence 
andhence truly realize ultimate no-self-
peace within all beings. Thus they know 
the all-pervading presence of perfect Buddhahood 
in each and every one of them. 
The outline of this chapter will be similar to that of the chapter 
on the Buddha, having three divisions: a definition of the 
nature of the sangha that occurs in the salutation, the 
identification of the qualities of the sangha, and a description 
of the six qualities mentioned in the salutation. The salutation 
begins, "I bow down ... " to the realized sangha who possess 
these qualities. This salutation is spoken by one who is trying 
to follow the example of these beings, one who is trying to 
reach enlightenment. The qualities mentioned in the 
salutation are of two kinds-the qualities of knowledge and 
the qualities of purity. The qualities of knowledge make it 
possible for the realized sangha to directly perceive the nature 
The Sangha -The Third ~jra Point 189 
of all phenomena just as they are. The qualities of purity free 
one from all impurities and obscurations. There are three 
aspects of knowledge: 
~ the knowledge of things as they are, 
~ the knowledge of variety and 
~ the inner knowledge of jnana which perceives the 
presence of Buddha potential in all beings. 
From these three kinds of knowledge emerge three aspects 
of freedom: 
~ freedom from emotional defilements, 
~ freedom from the hindrances of dualistic thinking 
which block the vision of the true nature of phenomena, and 
~ the freedom from the lower motivation which leads to 
the self-serving search for happiness for oneself alone. 
Context 
14. The sangha of the wise, who never regress, 
possesses unsurpassable qualities through pure perception: 
thusness, all-encompassing and the inner. 
0 The first aspect of knowledge is the jnana of things as 
they are. From the beginning of time the nature of mind has 
been empty and clear. Emptiness has been emphasized in the 
Madhyamaka teachings. But in the teachings on meditation, 
particularly the Mahamudra, emptiness is considered to be just 
one aspect of the nature of the mind. The other aspect is 
luminous clarity. The real nature of the mind then is a 
combination Jof emptiness and luminous clarity. The 
defilements of attachment, aggression and ignorance might or 
might not be present, but they are not an inherent part of the 
mind. The defilements are more like mistakes or delusions. 
190 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The jnana of things as they are perceives the true nature of the 
mind, the emptiness and luminous clarity, which is described 
in the next verse. 
$ The second aspect of knowledge, the jnana of val'iety, 
appears once one has experienced the knowledge of the ultimate 
nature of phenomena. Such luminous clarity develops that one 
can see the actual nature of beings -each and every form of 
sentience- exactly as he or she is. Through the jnana of variety 
of phenomena one experiences the true nature of beings as 
having no self. One discovers that the self does not exist and 
that this is the actual nature of all beings. 
$ The third aspect of the knowledge of the realized sangha 
is the pure vision gained through the inner jnana. Through 
this pure vision, "thus they know the all-pervasiye presence of 
perfect Buddhahood in each and every one of them." Through 
this aspect of knowledge individuals see the essence of 
Buddhahood in themselves and all the other sentient bei~gs. 
This essence is like the seed of the jnana of the Buddha and 
that same seed is also in the present mind of all beings. 
At the stage of ordinary beings, this essence ofBuddhahood 
does not manifest. At the stage of the bodhisattvas, this essence 
manifests to some extent. Only when one has achieved 
enlightenment can this essence fully manifest as Buddhahood. 
The difference between these three types of beings is not one 
of nature, because the essence of the Buddha is the same in all 
beings. This is what is "seen through inner jnana." 
In the 
salutation it says that the intelligence of the realized 
sangha is "no longer obscured." This refers to the three qualities 
of freedom. 
$ The first freedom is the freedom from emotional 
obscurations -attachment, aggression, or ignorance. 
The Sangha- The Third Vajra Point 191 
0 The second freedom is freedom from the obscuration 
of dualistic thinking. Dualistic thinking involves a subject and 
object and the belief that everything is substantial. 
0 The third freedom is the freedom from a combination 
of the previous two obscurations. The two obscurations are the 
source of the mistaken desire to find happiness for oneself alone, 
the desire that motivates the shravakas and pratyekabt;tddhas. In 
summary, through jnana the realized sangha possesses three 
types of knowledge so they can see the ultimate purity of the 
nature of all beings. 
In the chapter on the Buddha, of the three kayas, only the 
ultimate dharmakaya was discussed. In the chapter on the 
dharma, the scriptural dharma and dharma of realization were 
discussed and the realization dharma was emphasized. In the 
discussion of the sangha, the ordinary and the realized sangha 
were discussed with the emphasis on the realized sangha. In 
these three chapters the approach has emphasized the ultimate, 
the highest form of the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha. 
Six Qualities of the Sangha 
15. They have thusness (jnana) 
because they realize the peaceful nature of all beings, 
their absolute purity by nature, 
and that all defilements 
have been non-existent from the very beginning. 
The first quality of full knowledge of things as they are is only 
achieved with Buddhahood. When one is practicing on the 
path of the bodhisattva, this knowledge is present but in a 
limited fashion. The knowledge of things as they are is not the 
perception of the relative aspect, the illusory appearance of 
192 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
phenomena, but it is the perception of exactly what is, without 
any distortion. For example, if one sees a rope in the dark, one 
might mistake it for a snake. At the level of the perception of 
exactly what is, the rope would be seen as a rope rather than a 
snake because this knowledge does not include mistaken 
perception, the illusory appearances of samsara. 27 The actual 
nature of phenomena is revealed -which is the nature of the 
dharmadhatu, the original_ nature. This is the nature and 
function of this knowledge of things as they are. 
16. They have the all-encompassing, 
because their intelligence, 
which understands the ultimate object of knowledge, 
perceives that all beings have the nature of omniscience. 
The second quality, the knowledge of the variety of phenomena, 
is the perception of what there is in its many aspects. This 
perception includes not just ten things or one hundred things, 
but all phenomena manifesting their great diversity. The 
knowledge of things as they are is the knowledge of absolute 
truth, the knowledge of variety is the knowledge of the relative 
truth. With the knowledge of variety everything can be 
perceived: one sees the number of beings, the motivations of 
these beings, and one sees all of the various appearances of 
existence. One also sees the characteristics of objects such as 
their colors, form, etc., but there is no confusion, they are each 
seen very distinctly. Realized beings perceive the relative reality 
of all appearances but their perception is not divorced from 
the knowledge of things as they are. When one sees relative 
phenomena, one does not get caught up in confusion and 
illusion. 28 Even though realized beings can see the relative, at 
the same time they know exactly what is the ultimate, which 
means that they cannot return to the perception of illusions. 
The Sangha -The Third Vttjra Point 193 
17. Such understanding is the seeing of self-cognizant jnana. 
It is completely pure because the 'stainless space' 
is free from hindrance and desire. 
The third quality of the perception of inner jnana is very 
intimately connected with the knowledge of things as they 
are and the knowledge of variety. It is connected with the 
knowledge of things as they are because jnana perceives the 
true, absolute nature of phenomena, the "thatness of 
suchness." This perception is not of phenomena as totally 
empty but as being indivisible from all the qualities of 
Buddhahood. This perception is also connected with the 
knowledge of variety, in that it includes that all beings possess 
the essence ofBuddhahood. The word "inner" in "inner jnana" 
(Tib. nang gi yeshe) refers to the fact that it belongs to the 
true nature of the mind. "Jnana'' (Tib. yeshe) refers to the fact 
that of the two aspects of phenomena, emptiness and luminous 
clarity, jnana is luminous clarity. This jnana has the capacity 
to develop fully into all the qualities of freedom and maturity 
of a Buddha that include the capacity to perceive the inner 
jnana present in all beings. 
18. The never-regressing deeply-realized are a refoge 
for all beings because of their unsurpassable Buddha-jnana 
since they have exceedingly pure perception, through jnana. 
Perception, which manifests these three aspects of knowledge, 
is absolutely pure and this relates to the three qualities of purity. 
This purity is defined by the three qualities of purity mentioned 
earlier. The realized ones are free from the three types of 
obscurations of attachment, aggression, and ignorance. If their 
mind were clouded by these obscurations, they would act in a 
negative way causing them to be trapped in samsara. The three 
194 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
aspects of pure knowledge would then not arise. In the case of 
shravakas, for example, who are free of the first obscuration of 
emotions the realized sangha are most important. 29

GENERAL POINTS ABOUT REFUGE 
19. The refuges are presented as three, 
through the aspects of teacher, teaching and those who learn, 
in relation to three yana and to three kinds of activity. 
THERE ARE THREE REASONS that refuge is presented in three 
divisions. The first reason is that there are three vehicles: 
the Hinayana, the Mahayana and the Vajrayana. The second 
reason is that there are three types of actions: prostrating, 
making offerings and prayjng to the Buddha. Individuals 
performing these feel that the Buddha is really the best of all 
beings and a model to respect. Others feel that the dharma is 
really the most important object of refuge because it is the path 
ofliberation. They feel great faith and respect for the teachings. 
The third category of persons feels that the most important 
object of refuge for them is the sangha. For this reason they 
will direct most of their activity towards building the sangha. 
The third reason for the division of the three refuges is simply 
personal preference. Some are more attracted to the Buddha as 
a refuge, some to the dharma and some to the sangha. 
196 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
What is the Ultimate Refuge 
20. Neither both aspects of dharma nor the deeply-realized 
sangha constitute a supreme refuge which will last forever: 
because they are to be abandoned, 
one is inconstant and one is nothing whatsoever 
and they (the sangha) fear. 
The only ultimate source of refuge is the Buddha. The dharma 
and sangha are a refuge on the way to Buddhahood, but once 
one becomes a Buddha there is no longer any need for the 
props of dharma and sangha. Scriptural dharma cannot be an 
ultimate refuge because upon achieving Buddhahood, one leaves 
the teachings behind and no longer has any need to practice 
them. The dharma of realization is not the ultimate refuge 
either. On the path one goes through different stages of 
realization and as soon as one reaches one level, the previous 
one becomes obsolete. Because the path changes all the time, 
how could it be an ultimate source of refuge? The truth of 
cessation cannot be the ultimate source of refuge because once 
one develops realization, one has nothing tangible to show for 
it -rather one becomes free of what is unwanted. The truth of 
cessation is the elimination of that which should be abandoned 
rather than the acquisition of something positive. For this 
reason, it cannot be the ultimate source of refuge. 
21. Ultimately, only the Buddha constitutes a refuge for 
beings because the great Victor is the embodiment of 
dharma which is the ultimate attainment of the sangha. 
The sangha are not the ultimate source of refuge because they 
still have fear. The sangha have not completed the path and 
General Points About Refoge 197 
still need to take refuge in the Buddha. Therefore the realized 
sangha are not beyond all fears. 
In the ultimate sense, only the Buddha is the true refuge. 
All suffering and difficulties disappear only when changeless 
happiness is reached. This occurs only when one becomes a 
Buddha. Therefore, the Buddha is the only real refuge. Does 
this mean that refuge in the dharma and sangha is not very 
good? No, because the dharma and the sangha are objects of 
refuge which include the Buddha. The Buddha is the 
dharmakaya which literally means the "embodiment of 
dharma." The sangha are beings that are practicing on the path 
to Buddhahood and travel from one level to another until they 
finally reach complete realization. The qualities of the Buddha 
are also the ultimate attainment of the sangha, so it can be said 
that in the Buddha all the qualities of the dharma and the sangha 
are present. This is why the Buddha is the ultimate refuge. 
Why They are Called the Three jewels 
22. 'Rare and Supreme' because their occurrence is most rare, 
they are stainless, powerful the ornament of the world, 
the best possible thing and changeless. 
The original Sanskrit word for "jewel" in the "Three Jewels" 
was ratna. A literal translation into Tibetan should have been 
rinpoche which means "very precious" or having great value. 
The Tibetan translators however did not choose a literal 
translation, but preferred another word because when one says 
something has great value, one is emphasizing its outer quality. 
The Three Jewels are so much greater. For that reason "jewel" 
was translated as kon chog. Kon means "rare" and means 
"supreme" or "most excellent." They chose the word kon because 
198 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the Three Jewels are most rare and chog because they are 
unsurpassable. 
There are six reasons why the Buddha, dharma, and sangha 
are referred to as rare and supreme. 
• First, a jewel is very rare and not many persons find 
one. Likewise the Buddha, dharma and sangha are quite rare 
and many persons do not encounter them. 
• Second, jewels are stainless. When one finds a jewel, it 
is very bright and shiny, not dirty or repulsive. Similarly, the 
Three Jewels are very pure because they are totally free of all 
emotional stains. 
• Third, to possess jewels is to have power. When one 
possesses a jewel, one has something of great value. By selling 
it one can obtain financial power that allows one to accomplish 
many things. Similarly, the Three Jewels are powerful because 
they can extinguish all of the suffering of beings. 
• Fourth, a jewel is an ornament that enhances the beauty 
of everything else by its presence. In the same way, because 
their basic motivation is to benefit other beings with their mere 
presence, the Three Jewels are ornaments of the world because 
they bring tremendous goodness to the world. Also the sangha 
have such a great sense of self-respect and will not behave 
incorrectly. They are careful and very aware of their behavior. 
They have so much respect for others that they will not behave 
incorrectly towards them. These beings have a very high and 
pure quality because of the way they behave. People who 
practice the path of dharma on the whole will achieve the final 
realization of the path. So as time goes by there will be more 
and more beings that reach the highest state and there will be 
more and more ornaments of the world. 
0 The fifth reason is that the Three Jewels have the quality 
of excellence. In our world there.are many different persons 
who are supposed to be wonderful because they have achieved 
General Points About Refuge 199 
fame or success or wealth. But these worldly achievements are 
not permanent and ultimately are not capable of being 
beneficial. But the Three Jewels bring eternal peace and 
changeless happiness. 
0 The sixth reason is that the Three Jewels can bring 
fruition that is changeless. This is similar to a jewel because it 
doesn't disintegrate. Once one has reached Buddhahood, there 
is no possibility of falling back into confusion and suffering. 

Part Two 
THE BASIS FOR ATTAINING THE THREE 
RARE AND PRECIOUS REFUGES 

203 
THE LAST FouR VA.JRA PoiNTS 
THE LAST FOUR vajra points are: the Bud.d.ha-essence, 
enlightenment, the Bud.d.ha-qualities and. Buddha­
activities. Each vajra point will be d.ivid.ed. into two parts: a 
general and then a more detailed description. The following 
introduction is a description of the last four vajra points. These 
points cannot be understood directly by ordinary beings. 
The Nature of Each Point 
23. That these three rare and supreme arise 
from tainted suchness, 
untainted suchness, 
the qualities of immaculate enlightenment 
and the deeds of the Victorious Ones 
is precisely the domain of those aware of the ultimate. 
The nature of sugatagarbha or Buddha-essence is unpolluted 
suchness that is the true condition of phenomena when it is 
not distorted by illusion or the confusion created by the mind. 
In the example in which a rope is mistaken for a snake, if one 
understands the nature of the rope, one is not afraid of it. 
Normally, the suchness of phenomena is distorted by the 
illusion of samsara, even though the actual nature of this 
suchness is emptiness and luminous clarity. In this way, poliuted 
204 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
suchness is similar to Buddha-essence. If one has a jewel covered 
with mud and the mud is removed, the purity of the jewel is 
r~vealed. Because the nature of the jewel is pure, one can remove 
the impurities and it will still retain its purity. In the same way, 
Buddha-essence is stainless and when the emotional and 
cognitive obscurations are removed the presence of unpolluted 
suchness that is Buddhahood will appear. Once all the 
impurities are removed, the suchness can manifest in all of its 
purity and is revealed as enlightenment, which is the second of 
the last four vajra qualities. When the suchness has been 
purified, all the qualities inherent in this suchness can manifest. 
These are the Buddha qualities which are the third of the last 
four vajra points. The Buddha qualities represent total 
fulfillment for oneself and others. They are the fulfillment of 
one's own potential because all the causes of suffering and karma 
have been removed. This happiness is complete and unchanging 
because all causes of happiness are present. From the qualities 
of Buddhahood spring the power ~o help other beings, which 
is the last of the last four vajra points, Buddha activity. The 
realization ofBuddhahood is the supreme way to help all beings 
and as long as samsara continues Buddhahood will continue to 
help an infinite number of beings. Buddha activity gives more 
than temporary relief from suffering. It permits beings to 
achieve ultimate happiness. 
It is said that before we see the Three Jewels as rare and 
supreme, we see them as a refuge, with the Buddha being the 
ultimate refuge. But where do these refuges come from? They 
arise from the four qualities of unpolluted suchness (Buddha­
essence and enlightenment), the qualities ofBuddhahood, and 
the activities ofBuddhahood. Through these qualities one can 
achieve the three refuges. It is difficult for ordinary persons to 
understand how these last four vajra ppints can bring about 
The Last Four l-1ljra Points 205 
the realization of the Three Jewels because only Buddhas are 
capable of perceiving this directly. 
They are Inconceivable 
24. The potential for the rare and sublime 
is the domain of wisdom of the omniscient. 
In respective order, there are four reasons why 
these four aspects are inconceivable. 
The Buddha can perceive the last four vajra points and 
understand them fully. The Three Jewels are the fruition of the 
realization of the path. Only the Buddhas can see the causal 
ground because they are endowed with pure vision of both 
exactly what is and the variety of all phenomena. Therefore 
Buddha-essence, enlightenment, the Buddha qualities and 
Buddha activities are inconceivable to ordinary beings. 
Reasons for Inconceivability 
25. It is pure yet accompanied by defilements, 
and completely undefiled yet to be purified, 
it has truly inseparable qualities 
and is total non-thought and spontaneity. 
There are four re·asons why the four vajra points are 
inconceivable to ordinary beings. 
0 First, the essence of enlightenment is inconceivable 
because it is pure but is also accompanied by defilements. The 
essence of enlightenment is perfectly and naturally pure from 
the very beginning having never known any stain. Yet it is 
accompanied by defilements. This sounds like a paradox. The 
206 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
thought that suchness is present with defilements is quite 
inconceivable to ordinary beings. If one tries to meditate on 
this, one cannot experience it directly; therefore only the 
Buddhas can perceive it. 
0 Second, enlightenment is inconceivable to ordinary 
beings because enlightenment is completely free of defilements, 
and yet must be purified. Buddha-essence is completely pure 
and at the same time only through gradual purification can 
Buddha-essence manifest in its full purity (enlightenment). 
There is a logical contradiction between the original purity and 
the need to purify that purity through practice. 
0 Third, the Buddha qualities are inconceivable because 
they are inseparable from Buddha-essence. From the beginning 
all the qualities ofBuddhahood are present in Buddha-essence, 
yet one achieves all these qualities only when one reaches 
Buddhahood. 
0 Fourth, Buddha activity is inconceivable because it is 
both spontaneous and non-conceptual. Buddha activity occurs 
without any effort on the part of the Buddha. This activity 
responds to what people need, yet the Buddha does not need 
to think, "I must do this for this person." However, in every 
instant the appropriate activity occurs exactly in the way it suits 
the needs of each and every being. 
26. Since there is that to be realized. 
the realization, the attributes of realization 
and that which brings realization, then respectively, 
the first point is the prime cause, that to be purified, 
and the remaining three points constitute conditions. 
The reasons that these vajra points are inconceivable is that 
they appear to be paradoxes. However, closer examination 
reveals no real contradiction. 
The Last Four Vajra Points 207 
Ct First, the nature or essence of Buddha-essence is 
perfectly pure. The impurities, the defilements, are only the 
fruition of a mistaken view and therefore have nothing to do 
with the actual essence of Buddhahood. 
$ Second, the defilements can be removed because they 
are not an inherent aspect of enlightenment. For this reason, 
they cannot pollute its nature. 
$ Third, if one examines the qualities of Buddhahood 
there is no real contradiction either, because from the viewpoint 
of the actual nature these qualities have always been present in 
the essence of Buddhahood. When they are covered up by 
impurities, these qualities manifest as activity. When impurities 
are removed, the qualities display their presence as enlightened 
action. This is similar to what happens on a cloudy day. When 
douds cover the sun, the sunlight cannot manifest; however 
the light itselfhas not been changed. In the same way, when 
the qualities of enlightenment are obscured they do not manifest 
but they are still present. 
$ The fourth point of activity does not involve a 
contradiction. Buddha-activity is spontaneous, effortless, and 
non-conceptual. It is the result of all the previous.wishes and 
resolutions and prayers made by the Buddhas when they were 
on the path to enlightenment. From the strong impetus of 
previous practice all this activity can arise spontaneously and 
without any conceptualization. 
The Realization of these Vajra Points 
The essence ofBuddhahood is actual realization. The attributes 
that spring from this realization are the qualities that enable 
other beings to develop realization. Buddha-essence constitutes 
208 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the causal <::ondition and the other three vajra points constitute 
the result which makes it possible for other beings to be purified. 
Bu DOHA .. ESSENCE 
Tbe Fourtb Vajra Point 209 
BUDDHA-ESSENCE is what is to be realized. This chapter covers 
this point through four sections: 
~ what is Buddha-essence, 
~ ten qualities of Buddha-essence, 
~ nine examples of Buddha-essence, and 
~ the importance of the Buddha-essence teachings. 
A. What is Buddha-Essence3° 
27. The Buddha-essence is ever-present in everyone because 
the dharmakaya of perfect Buddhahood pervades all, 
the suchness is without differences and 
they have potential. 
28. It is taught that all beings possess the essence of Buddha 
because Buddha-jnana has ever dwelt in them, 
210 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the immaculate nature is non-dual and 
the Buddha-potential is named after its result. 
The Buddha taught three turnings of the wheel of dharma. In 
the first turning the Buddha taught the Four Noble Truths 
which are principally related to the relative level of reality. We 
perceive the nature of suffering which is the First Noble Truth. 
The origin of this suffering, the Second Noble Truth, is to be 
found in all our previous actions and emotional obscurations. 
The Third Noble Truth, the cessation of suffering, appears when 
one eliminates these two causes of suffering. Finally, in order 
to realize the truth of cessation, one has to enter the proper 
path, the Fourth Noble Truth, which is the truth of the path. 
The Buddha then explained that one must progress along.five 
different levels of the path before reaching complete 
enlightenment. In the second turning the Buddha taught the 
ultimate nature of phenomena. He said that all phenomena 
are empty by nature. In the third turning the Buddha went 
further when he explained that this emptiness of phenomena 
does not mean simple absence of objects. When beings are in 
the impure phase, they still possess the essence ofBuddhahood. 
When they reach Buddhahood, the two-fold jnana appears: 
~he knowledge of exactly what is and the variety of phenomena. 
The third turning exceeds the meaning of the first two turnings. 
The Uttaratantra relates to the third turning because it is 
concerned with the presence ofBuddha-essence in all beings. 
There are three reasons that Buddha-essence is present in 
all beings. 
$ First, the dharmakaya of the Buddha pervades all 
phenomena and can give rise to any phenomena and in this 
way, is present everywhere. 
$ Second, the suchness, or the actual nature of nirvana 
and samsaric phenomena is undifferentiated. There is no "good 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 211 
suchness" which relates to nirvana and no "bad suchness" which 
relates to samsara. There is only one suchness of the nature of 
all phenomena. 
0 Third, all beings possess the foundation of Buddha­
essence which, when it is purified, can develop into full 
Buddhahood. 
B. Ten Qualities of Buddha-Essenc;e 
29. The meaning intended by 'ultimate domain' 
should be known through its essential character, 
cause, result, Junction, endowments, approach, 
phases, all-pervasiveness, unalterability 
and the inseparability of its qualities. 
There are ten different aspects by which one can approach an 
understanding of the essence of Buddhahood. These are: 
character, cause, result, function, endowments, approach, the 
various phases, all-pervasiveness, unalterability, and 
inseparability of its qualities. These are listed in the table at the 
end of this chapter. 
1. Character 
30. Like the purity of a jewel, space, or water, 
it is always undefiled in essence. 
It emerges through aspiration for dharma, 
highest prajna, meditation, and compassion. 
31. Its qualities resemble those of a valued gem 
because it is powerful, 
of space because it is unalterable, 
and of water because it moistens. 
212 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The essential character ofBuddha-essence is explained by means 
of three examples -a jewel, space or the sky, and water. The 
significance of these examples will be explained later. The 
dharmakaya is like a jewel because it is totally free of any 
impurities. It is like a cloudless sky because the sky is by nature 
free of clouds. It is like water because water is naturally very 
pure. The impurities found in water are not part of the nature 
of the water. In the same way, Buddha-essence is perfectly pure. 
There are four different ways in which Buddha-essence can 
be made manifest. * First, one must aspire to realize the dharma because 
without aspiration one will not practice it. * The second way is to allow the nature of Buddha­
essence to shine through in all of its luminous clarity. This is 
accomplished with intelligence (prajna). 
$ The third way is through samadhi (meditation). * The fourth is compassion. 
Without study one will not reflect on Buddha-essence and 
without meditation one will not be able to continue the process 
which makes Buddha-essence manifest. 
Buddha-essence is compared to a jewel because it possesses 
the tremendous power to achieve ultimate happiness, 
Buddhahood, which is of greatest value for all beings. It is 
extremely precious and powerful and is compared to a jewel 
because a jewel has the power to dispel poverty. 
The essence ofBuddhahood is compared to the sky because 
the sky never changes. The earth is constantly changing, but 
the sky, even over periods of thousands of years, never becomes 
anything different. In the same way, the suchness of all 
phenomena is unchanging. There is no alteration in its nature. 
The essence ofBuddhahood is compared to water because 
water has a wet and flowing quality that allows it to go 
everywhere. Buddha-essence also possesses the ability to 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 213 
moisten, the moistening quality of compassion; its mere 
presence enables everything to grow. 
Buddha-essence possesses the moistening quality of 
compassion, the unchanging quality of space and the power of 
a jewel. 
2. Cause 
32. Hostility towards the dharma, 
the view that self-entity exists, 
fear ofsamsara's suffirings and 
disregard for the benefiting of beings 
are the four sorts of obscuration. 
In our present condition as ordinary beings the essence of 
Buddhahood has not manifested because we encounter the four 
obstacles to Buddhahood. 
0 The first obstacle is hostility or a natural dislike for the 
dharma. One may wish not to have anything to do with dharma 
and not want to practice. Obviously, one will never enter the 
dharma with this kind of attitude. Even if one does not have 
hostility towards the dharma, one may have no confidence in 
the value of the teachings and feel that everything taught is 
useless. 
0 The second obstacle is the strong belief in the reality 
of a self. Even if one is interested in the dharma and wishes to 
practice, if one has a very solid belief in the reality of self, one 
will encounter an obstacle to the manifestation of Buddha­
essence because a belief in self contradicts the logic of the 
path and is also the root of all negativity. In order for the 
essence ofBuddhahood to manifest, it is necessary to remqve 
the two types of emotional and cognitive obscurations. If one 
214 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
has a very strong belief in a self, one cannot begin to remove 
these obscurations. 
$ The third obstacle is the fear of the suffering of samsara 
because this fear will prevent one from entering the Mahayana 
path. We are striving to eliminate suffering but in order to do 
this we must understand that suffering is not real, that its nature 
is empty. If one .can understand that suffering is void, one will 
not fear this suffering and will be able to help all beings attain 
freedom from it. 
$ The fourth obstacle is the lack of concern for the welfare 
of other beings and the associated lack of desire to help them. 
This occurs when one feels one's own problems are enough 
and for this reason one is not really interested in what happens 
to others. Someone who practices with this attitude is going to 
reach the higher states of rebirth in samsara and a form of 
liberation such as that of the arhats. However, this liberation 
will not be the complete realization of Buddha-essence, which 
manifests as Buddhahood. 31 
33 .... of the desire-bound, the mistaken, 
shravakas, and pratyekabuddhas respectively. 
The causes of purification are four: 
strong aspiration for the dharma and so on. 
Each obstacle has a type of person associated with it. 
$ The first obstacle is associated with persons hostile to 
the dharma. 
$ The second obstacle is an integral part of many 
religions. Some religions include a need to eliminate a belief in 
a self in their basic belief system, but many do not even question 
the reality of the self because it is considered to be a fundamental 
aspect of ordinary experience and as such does not need to be 
relinquished. The Buddhist term for people holding this belief 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth vajra Point 215 
in self is tirthika. Tirthikas are people who are fairly close to 
the dharma in that they are religious, but their religious belil:f 
is not powerful enough to manifest the essence ofBuddhahood 
because they still believe in the reality of a sel£ 
0 The third obstacle limits the realization of the shravakas. 
They are individuals who are only interested in their own 
liberation because they are afraid of suffering. 
0 The fourth obstacle limits the liberation of die 
pratyekabuddhas. 
These four obstacles can be removed by their opposite 
qualities. 
~ The aspiration to practice on the path will eliminate 
hostility towards the dharma. 
~ Great prajna will eliminate the belief in self. 
~ The best form of meditation, samadhi, will eliminate 
the fear of samsara. 
~ Compassion will awaken a concern for the sufferings 
of other beings. 
In the Uttaratantra the main emphasis is on view. Practice 
is mentioned, of course, but this text is essentially an explanation 
of the view. The text quite clearly explains the actual nature of 
phenomena in terms of its two aspects, emptiness and luminous 
clarity. The empty aspect is the spacious, unreal aspect. The 
luminous clarity aspect is the intelligence, the vivid 
understanding. In this text these two aspects are shown to be 
the inseparable union of emptiness and luminous clarity, which 
is Buddha-essence. 
To summarize, Buddha potential can be examined in terms 
of its innate aspect and the aspect developed through practice. 
Through practice and the presence of certain qualities, Buddha­
essence can manifest. But in attempting to develop this one 
encounters four kinds of obstaCles. If these four obstacles can 
be overcome with the help of the four favorable conditions, 
216 The Uttaratantra-A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
one can work towards Buddhahood and gradually approach 
the state of the son of a Buddha - a bodhisattva. 
34. Those whose seed is aspiration for the supreme yana, 
whose .mother is prajna, originator of Buddha qualities, 
for whom meditative stability is a comfortable womb, 
and compassion of a nanny -these are born as Buddha's 
offspring. 
The birth of a bodhisattva can, for example, be compared to 
the birth of a child. 
0 First, aspiration to practice the dharma must have 
arisen, not just dharma in general, but the highest form of 
dharma, the Mahayana. The aspiration to practice the dharma 
creates all of the qualities needed on the path and will eventually 
lead to Buddhahood. This is compared to the semen of the 
father, which can give birth to a child. This seed needs a mother. 
0 Once one aspires to develop realization, one will want 
to practice the dharma and develop an understanding of non­
self, as well as the understanding of the true nature of phenomena. 
This quality of prajna, the second quality, is compared to the 
mother because the semen needs a special environment in which 
to develop. This is the body of the mother. 
0 The mother's womb represents meditation, the third 
quality. If there is some degree of understanding of non-self 
and the nature of phenomena, this understanding will increase. 
This is like the embryo of a child that needs to grow in the 
favorable environment of the womb until it is fully developed, 
possessing all of the parts of its body. Similarly, in order to 
reach its full development, prajna requires the favorable 
environment of meditation. 
0 The fourth quality of compassion is compared to a 
nursemaid. When babies are born they still need a great deal of 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vttjra Point 217 
care. With proper care and attention, their bodies will grow 
and their intelligence will develop. Eventually the child becomes 
an adult. The nursemaid is like compassion because compassion 
makes the development of the qualities of prajna and meditation 
possible. When compassion has arisen, one's understanding 
grows and one's meditation improves. 
This example makes it clear why it is that if one possesses 
the four qualities of aspiration, prajna, meditation and 
compassion one can become a son of the Buddha and truly 
work on the path of enlightenment. 
The meditation referred to here is principally tranquility 
meditation (Skt. Shamatha). It is consistently connected to both 
the intelligence of prajna and compassionate care for other 
beings. Without these two qualities of meditation we will not 
be able to cut the root of samsara because it will not be based 
on an understanding of non-self. Any form of meditation, 
which is not based on prajna and compassion, will create karma, 
which brings about rebirth in a form or formless realm. 
Result and Function Viewed Together 
35. Its result has the transcendent qualities 
of purity, identity, happiness, and permanence. 
Its function is revulsion for suffering 
accompanied by an aspiration, a longing, for peace. 
The third quality is the result, which occurs when Buddha­
essence is fully manifest. The fourth quality is the influence 
the fruition of Buddha-essence exerts. These two points can be 
explained in conjunction with one another because while 
fruition is the ultimate goal the influence of fruition is the 
immediate goal. 
218 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The fruition of Buddha-essence possesses the transcendental 
qualities of purity, identity, happiness and permanence. 
Complete purity is achieved when Buddhahood is achieved. 
When one has gone beyond self and non-self, one achieves the 
transcendental quality of identity. The qualities of 
transcendental happiness and permanence are also manifest at 
the time of fruition. The text states that the function of Buddha­
essence brings about "revulsion for suffering" and "longing for 
peace." Buddha-essence enables us to recognize the suffering 
of our existence. When we have recognized this, we develop a 
longing to overcome suffering. 32 This aspiration is present in 
all beings, though it is hazy in some persons and very clear in 
others. The degree ofluminous Clarity in which Buddha-essence 
manifests depends on our circumstances. If the right conditions 
occur, individuals will meet a teacher and will be able to follow 
the path. Those who have not encountered these external 
conditions but still have the wish to eliminate suffering will 
not know that there is a path to liberation. For this reason, 
Buddha-essence is said to influence individuals by causing them 
to want to eliminate suffering and find happiness. 
3. Result 
36. In brief the result of these 
constitute the respective remedies to both 
the four ways ofstrayingfrom dharmakaya 
and their four antidotes. 
There are four conditions that contradict the emergence of the 
qualities of the dharmakaya: 
~ impurity, 
~ absence of true transcendent identity, 
~ suffering, and 
~ Impermanence. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth ~jra Point 219 
When one dwells in samsara, one interprets things incorrectly; 
one believes that what is impure is pure, one believes what is 
selfless possesses a self, one believes something permanent is 
impermanent, and one believes that suffering is happiness. 
These are the features of samsaric illusion; we perceive 
everything as the opposite of what it really is. In the Hinayana 
teachings the Buddha taught that what we believe is pure is 
not; that the belief in self is mistaken, phenomena are devoid 
of any self-entity; that what we believe is happiness is really 
suffering and misery; and that what we take to be permanent 
constantly changes. At the relative level samsara is impure, 
individuals have a self~33 they experience suffering and 
everything is impermanent. At the level of absolute truth, 
however, these four aspects of samsara are no longer relevant. 
Ultimate reality transcends both these four aspects of samsara 
and their opposites. It transcends pure and impure, non-self 
and self, and every form of delusion. 
3 7. This is purity because its nature is pure 
and all impurities of karma have been removed. 
It is true identity because all of the complications of 'self' 
Or 'no-self' have been absolutely quelled. 
* The first quality of transcendent purity transcends pure 
and impure. This purity is not the purity which is a concept 
found in the language of ordinary beings, nor is it the freedom 
from the impurities shravakas and pratyekabuddhas understand 
it to be; it is a purity that transcends these notions. There are 
two aspects of this purity: the purity of our true nature and the 
purity that is free of incidental impurities. The purity of Buddha­
essence is extremely pure and complete, it is only masked by 
impurities. It is transcendental purity because when these fleeting 
impurities have been removed, purity is fully manifest. 
220 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
0 The second quality is that of transcendentidentity. The 
ordinary belief in the self includes two different aspects- innate 
belief in self and the habit of thinking of self as "1." Innate 
belief in self is present at birth. No one needs to teach us that 
we are "I;" we automatically understand ourselves as "1." This 
belief in a self is also found in some religions that believe in the 
existence of a self that must be liberated. In contrast, the belief 
in non-self is developed by those who practice the Hinayana 
and the general aspect of the Mahayana. What is important to 
understand is that both the belief in a self and a belief in non­
self are simply mental concepts and, for this reason, have no 
actual reality. Transcendent identity corresponds to the complete 
pacification and the eventual disappearance of all such illusory 
fabrications as the idea of self or non-sel£ 
38. It is happiness through the demise of the five aggregates, 
which are of a mental nature, and their causes. 
It is permanence since the sameness 
of samsara and nirvana have been realized. 
0 The third quality is the transcendent quality of 
happiness. When one is born in samsara, one is subjected to 
different types of suffering- all-pervasive suffering, the suffering 
ofchange and the suffering of suffering. 34 But since one is not 
aware of the real su.ffering of conditioned existence, one believes 
that to achieve happiness is to remain lost in samsara. 
On the Hinayana path one learns that the actual nature of 
samsara is suffering. One meditates on this idea, develops a 
conviction that it is true and practices abandoning the causes 
of suffering. However, in the special aspect of the Mahayana 
teachings, it is taught that the views of suffering and happiness 
of samsara are illusory and that the actual nature of phenomena 
is beyond both these concepts. One learns that suffering is only 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vttjra Point 221 
a mental creation of the five aggregates, being produced by the 
very fine mental imprints on, the mind that are created by 
ignorance.35 The ultimate nature is beyond both the idea of 
suffering and the idea of happiness. This is transcendent 
happiness. 
• The fourth quality is transcendent permanence. When 
one is an ordinary person lost in samsara, one believes all things 
are lasting, permanent, even though all conditioned things 
constantly change. The belief in permanence is an illusion. In 
the Hinayana practice the teachings reverse the idea of 
permanence replacing it with the concept of impermanence. 
However; in the ultimate sense, both of these concepts have no 
actual reality. The actual nature of things transcends the ideas 
of permanence and impermanence; Buddha-essence is 
transcendent permanence because the whole of samsara and 
nirvana is identical and the qualities inherent in nirvana are 
already present in samsara. This permanence should be 
understood as the transcendence of change because everything 
is identical.3 6 
In the teachings of the Hinayana or the Mahayana there 
are four transcendental qualities: 
~ purity, 
~ identity, 
~ happiness, and 
~ permanence. 
The idea that Buddha-essence can be described by those 
qualities seems to contradict the teachings of the Buddha. 
However, these four transcendent qualities are explained in the 
context of a description of the ultimate nature of phenomena 
which is beyond the limiting extremes of suffering and 
happiness, of permanence and impermanence, of self and non­
self, and of purity and impurity. 
222 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
39. Those of compassionate love have, through prajna, 
completely severed all self-cherishing. 
They will not want to enter a personal nirvana 
because they dearly care for every being. 
Hence, by reliance upon these means to enlightenment 
i.e. wisdom and compassion, 
the deeply-realized abide neither in samsara 
nor the quiescence of a personal nirvana. 
Once we have achieved these four transcendent qualities, we 
are free from the extremes of samsara and nirvana. We will not 
fall back into samsara nor enter into the one-sided nirvana of 
individual liberation. This fruition is the achievement of 
liberation from the two extremes. Prajna_prevents us from falling 
into samsara and compassion prevents us from seeking 
liberation for ourselves alone. There are two aspects to a belief 
in a self -the self of the person and the self of phenomena. 
Through prajna, the highest form of spiritual intelligence, we 
can cut the root of this misconception and become free of 
emotional and cognitive obscurations as well as all of the fine 
mental imprints. With compassion we see beyond our own 
personal interest and satisfaction. In the root text it says that 
those with compassionate love will "completely severe all self­
cherishing" because they cherish all beings. Cherishing means 
that we will not abandon anyone but will continually try to 
help them. 
4. The Function 
40. Were there no Buddha-essence 
there would be no discontent with suffering 
nor desire, effort and the aspiration for nirvana. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 223 
41. Awareness of samsara's shortcomings, suffering 
and nirvana's quality, happiness, 
are due to the existence of this potential. 
Why is this so? Without such potential 
they would not be present. 
The influence or function ofBuddha-essence can be explained 
in two points. The first point is an explanation of what would 
happen if Buddha-essence were not present in all beings. If 
beings did not have Buddha-essence, they would not become 
tired of suffering and would not want to transcend it. One can 
see that non-sentient objects such as trees or stones do not 
have Buddha-essence; consequently they do not have any desire 
to achieve Buddhahood. This desire to transcend suffering is 
what would be missing if sentient beings did not possess 
Buddha-essence. 
In the second point it is explained that a great deal of pain 
and many difficulties are an inherent aspect of samsara. Of 
course, there will be some happiness and satisfaction, but this 
happiness is likely to change and become pain. When we are in 
samsara, we are likely to experience pain. Because we possess 
Buddha-essence, we are able to see that worldly existence brings 
suffering and we can conceive of nirvana. We can aspire to 
transcend the suffering of conditioned existence. If one didn't 
possess this seed of Buddhahood, it would be impossible to 
understand the nature of samsara and to strive for nirvana. 
5. Endowments 
42. It is like a great ocean -an inexhaustible abode 
containing precious substances of inestimable qualities. 
It is like a lamp-flame because this essence 
is endowed with inseparable qualities.,-
224 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The fifth point explains endowments, or more literally, 
possession of the qualities of Buddha-essence at the moment 
of fruition. Buddha-essence can be compared to the ocean 
because the ocean contains many precious things. In the same 
way, Buddha-essence has Fhe potential for achieving the 
enlightened state because it 'already possesses all the various 
qualities ofBuddhahood. These same qualities are the qualities 
that describe the body of the Buddha. They are also the qualities 
that the path to Buddhahood requires such as faith, courage, 
prajna and so on. These various qualities are inseparable as is 
demonstrated by the example of a lamp-flame. A more detailed 
explanation is as follows: 
43. Because it contains the essence of dharmakaya, 
the jnana of the Victors and great compassion, 
it has been taught as being similar to an ocean 
through being an environment, its gems and its waters. 
Buddha-essence possesses three seeds: 
~ the seed of the dharmakaya, 
~ the seed of jnana, and 
~ the seed of compassion 
• The completely pure dharmakaya of the Buddhas is 
the first seed of aspiration. Buddha-essence can arise only in 
those who have the aspiration to achieve enlightenment. 
• The second seed is that through which the jnana of the 
Victorious Ones (the Buddhas) is realized, which is prajna. The 
ground from which prajna develops is meditation. In ordinary 
beings prajna is fairly weak but when it is cultivated it becomes 
stronger and stronger until it blossoms into the full jnana of 
the Buddhas. Fully developed this jnana sees the nature of and 
the variety of phenomena. 
Buddha-Essence -The Fourth ~jra Point 225 
0 The third seed is the great compassion of the Buddhas. 
The Buddhas have perfect compassion that is free of any 
conceptual reference point. 37 The fruition of this seed leads to 
enlightenment. So within Buddha-essence are contained all the 
seeds of the future qualities of the Buddhas. 
When the endowments of Buddha-essence are compared 
to an ocean, the vastness of the ocean is likened to the aspiration 
for enlightenment. The qualities of prajna and meditation are 
compared to the jewels in that ocean. Buddha-essence manifests 
these two precious qualities that are so very precious because 
they give rise to the twofold jnana of the Buddhas. The wetness 
of the ocean is compared to the moistening quality of 
compassion in order to show that compassion moistens prajna 
and meditation; prajna and meditation are not just dry qualities. 
44. Since direct cognition, jnana and freedom from stain 
are inseparable within the immaculate ground, 
they are compared to the light, heat and color of a flame. 
In the second example of verse forty-two, the qualities of 
Buddha-essence at the time of fruition are compared to a lamp­
flame, the example explained in this verse. Buddha-essence is 
completely stainless, totally pure in nature even though some 
fleeting impurities cover it temporarily. The essence of 
Buddhahood at fruition manifests the qualities of clear 
cognition (Tib. ngon she), jnana, and freedom from impurities. 
0 The first quality of clear cognition possesses five powers 
that are related to the variety of phenomena. The first power of 
cognition is "divine vision" which is the ability to see extremely 
distant and small things. The second power is the "divine ear" 
which is the ability to hear very distant and very soft sounds. 
The third power is the "knowledge of the mind of others" which 
is clairvoyance or the exact knowledge of the thoughts of others. 
226 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The fourth power is "knowledge of the past" which is the ability 
to see events that occurred going back thousands of years. The 
fifth power is the ":ffiiraculous transformation of ones body. "38 
All of these powers of clear cognition are directly related to 
Buddha's jnana. 
0 The second quality of jnana refers to the knowledge of 
exactly what is. It perceives phenomena as merely 
manifestations, not having any actual reality. This jnana is 
stainless because it is not polluted by any belief in the solidity 
of appearances. 
0 The third quality is luminous clarity. There are two 
aspects of knowledge: knowledge of the relative and of the 
ultimate. These are always present together; when one 
comprehends the variety of phenomena, one also understands 
the true nature of phenomena. In this way one manifests the 
third quality of luminous clarity. 
The relationship between these three qualities is 
demonstrated by comparing them to a lamp-flame's light, heat 
and color. The light can dispel darkness; once darkness is gone 
one can see everything very clearly. The brightness of the light 
can be compared to the clear cognition that can see phenomena 
very clearly. The stainless jnana is compared with the heat of 
~he butter lamp because the heat is inseparable from the 
brightness of the flame. Similarly, the stainless jnana of the 
Buddha is inseparable from the essence of Buddhahood. The 
color of the butter lamp refers to the great luminous clarity of 
the knowledge of the Buddha. This example of the butter lamp 
explains the way in which these three qualities of Buddha­
essence are inseparable. 
6. Approach 
45. Suchness is approached in different ways 
by ordinary beings, the deeply realized 
Buddha-Essence -The Fourth ~jra Point 227 
and the completely-enlightened. 
This is how those who see the true nature 
have taught beings about this heart-essence of the Victors. 
46. Ordinary beings distort, 
those who see the truth correct the distortion 
and tathagatas (approach it) just as it is, 
undistortedly and without conceptual complication. 
Buddha-essence is present in all beings, its essential nature never 
changes or transforms into anything. Some individuals 
understand this, some do not, and the teachings describe three 
different types of individuals. 
~ The first type is ordinary beings that are not yet free of 
their emotional instability. 
~ Then there are more evolved persons, the second type, 
bodhisattvas. 
~ The third type is the perfect Buddhas who can be 
described by the Tibetan name for "Buddha" which is formed 
of two syllables sang gye. Sang means "pure," and gye means 
"perfectly blossomed." Perfect purity refers to the first syllable 
of sang gye and perfect knowledge refers to the second syllable. 
When the qualifier of "perfect" is added to sang gye that name 
includes all of the qualities of purity and understanding that 
are perfectly complete in the Buddha. 
These three types of individuals approach Buddha-essence 
very differently. The ordinary beings will approach it in a 
mistaken way, the bodhisattvas will approach it without mistake, 
and the Buddhas will see it directly. The difference is simply 
the way in which they approach Buddha-essence, but the object 
of their approach, enlightenment, is the same for all of them. 
The following is a more ditailed explanation. 
228 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Ordinary beings approach Buddha-essence through a 
completely mistaken perception. This can be understood by 
examining the example of a rope in a dark place that someone 
has mistaken for a snake. If one person sees this rope as a snake 
and another person sees it as only a rope, the perception of one 
is mistaken and that of the other correct, even though both are 
looking at the same thing. So it is with Buddha-essence: 
ordinary beings see it incorrectly and the bodhisattvas see it 
correctly. But there is still a third way to see it. The Buddhas 
see Buddha-essence just as it is with their direct, clear, extensive, 
vast and complete vision. The bodhisattvas, for instance, see it 
clearly, but do not see it in its entirety. So it is said that the 
Buddhas see Buddha-essence completely, just as it is, with a 
complete absence of conceptual interference. 
7. Phases 
47. The impure, those both pure yet impure 
and those absolutely, perfectly pure 
are known respectively as ordinary beings, 
bodhisattvas, and tathagatas. 
In the seventh point Buddha-essence is described in terms of 
phases: 
~ the impure phase, 
~ the slightly impure phase (mixed), and 
~ the totally pure phase, 
The impure phase is the stage of ordinary beings in which 
Buddha-essence is obscured by the emotional and cognitive 
obscurations. 
The mixed phase is the stage of the bodhisattvas. It is purer 
than the first, but some impurities still remain. There are two 
kinds of impurities- impurities related to insight and impurities 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 229 
related to the cultivation of this insight. Bodhisattvas have 
relinquished impurities of insight that are intellectually created 
perceptions. Normally one understands the world in terms of 
many concepts that distort the way in which phenomena are 
perceived. The bodhisattvas have eliminated the concepts that 
obscure the true nature of phenomena, but they have not 
dispelled the "innate obscuration (cognitive or dualistic 
obscurations)" which can only be eliminated by cultivation of 
this insight. 
The Buddhas, on the other hand, have purifled all 
obscurations. Their perception is totally pure. This is the 
third phase. 
48. Buddha-essence, summarized by the six points, 
essence and so forth, 
is explained through three phases 
and by means of three terms. 
In summary, Buddha-essence is described in terms of three 
phases: that of impure, partially pure, and completely pure -
these are similar to the six points of character, cause, and so on. 
The impure phase includes ordinary beings, the partially pure 
bodhisattvas, and completely pure only the tathagatas. 
8. All-pervasiveness 
49. just as space, concept-free by nature 
is all-embracing, so also is the immaculate space, 
the nature of mind, all-pervading. 
50. This, the general characteristic of all, 
permeates the faulty, the,~oble and the ultimate, 
just as space permeates all forms 
whether lesser, mediocre or perfect. 
230 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
All-pervasive means that Buddha-essence embraces everything. 
There are no exceptions. For example, space is all-pervasive, it 
is everywhere and contains everything. Of the two natures of 
mind (emptiness and luminous clarity) emptiness is compared 
to space, while luminous clarity is given the name "immaculate 
space." Immaculate space is the name for Buddhahood and 
pervades all beings. 
Logic distinguishes the general and particular characteristics 
of phenomena. A general characteristic would be something 
like impermanence, which applies to all phenomena. A 
particular characteristic would be like fire that is hot and 
burning and which does not define other phenomena. Buddha­
essence is a general characteristic of all beings irrespective of 
what qualities they possess. This is compared to space that 
pervades all forms and objects from very precious jewels to the 
most inferior· objects such as rubbish -all of which have 
different particular characteristics. 
9. Unalterability 
51. Since the faults are only incidental whereas 
its qualities are part of its very character, 
it is the changeless reality, 
the same after as it was before. 
One's faults are an incidental aspect of Buddha-essence, while 
one's good qualities are inherent. The nature of Buddha-essence 
is that it never changes. The faults that cover it are temporary. 
The qualities are inherently present in Buddha-essence and 
manifest in enlightenment. They do not begin to develop later 
at the fruition of Buddhahood. Therefore, Buddha-essence is 
changeless and it is the same before and after Buddhahood. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Wljra Point 231 
Unalterability of Buddha-Essence in the 
Impure Phase 
52. Space pervades all yet remains absolutely uncorrupted 
on account of its extreme subtlety; 
likewise this, present in all beings, 
remains absolutely taint-free. 
53. just as universes always arise 
and disintegrate in space, 
likewise do the senses arise 
and disintegrate in the uncreated space. 
54. just as space has never been consumed by fire, 
likewise this is never consumed 
by the fires of ageing, sickness and death. 
55. Earth is sustained by water, water by air and 
air is sustained by space, but space 
is sustained by neither air, water nor earth. 
56. In a similar way, the aggregates, elements, and entrances 
are based upon action and the defilements. 
Action and the defilements are always based 
upon an erroneous way of using the mind. 
57. This aberrant way of using the mind is based upon 
the purity of the mind, yet mind's true nature 
is based upon none of the multitude of phenomena. 
Buddha-essence is unalterable in ordinary beings for four 
reasons. 
232 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
0 First, it is like space39 which is void and pervades 
everything. There is not even one object in the universe that is 
not permeated by space. Because the nature of space is extremely 
subtle objects do ~ot alter its nature regardless of whether the 
objects it encompasses are pure or polluted. From the beginning, 
Buddha-essence has been present in all beings but it has been 
covered by the impurities of anger, jealousy, stupidity, etc., 
impurities that do not affect the nature of this Buddha essence. 
So Buddha-essence is unaffected by the impurities just as space 
is unaffected by the objects it contains. 
0 Second, consider the way in which this nature can be 
compared to all. the universes which are made up of the 
elements. When the universe first begins, it manifests in space 
and when it disintegrates, it disintegrates into space. All this 
occurs in space, but space itself doesn't change or decompose. 
In the same way, Buddha-essence contains the five aggregates, 
elements, entrances, etc.,40 and the appearances which we 
experience. Everything arises and disintegrates in the uncreated 
space of Buddha-essence. 
0 Third, one may think the process of arising and 
disintegration may change space in such a way that it will be 
destroyed. But, for example, fires have never destroyed space. 41 
$ince the beginning of time countless fires have never destroyed 
space. In the same way, the fires of death, sickness and old age 
have never burned out Buddha-essence. At the relative level, 
birth, sickness and old age do appear, but these appearances do 
not affect Buddha-essence just as fire doesn't affect space. 
0 Fourth, Buddha-essence is unalterable. When the 
universe was formed, the earth element rested on water and 
this ocean rested on a great circle of air that in turn rests in 
space. 42 All of the elements rest on space while space rests on 
nothing at all. All the five aggregates, the elements of thought, 
and the sense faculties rest on action (karma). They arise because 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 233 
there is karma, positive and negative actions, and karma rests 
on the defilements of attachment, aggression, and ignorance. 
These defilements rest on a false view of the true nature of 
things. This false view of reality rests on the purity or true nature 
of the mind. But this true nature of the mind (Buddha-essence), 
like space, does not rest on anything. Therefore, in this example 
the earth can be compared to the five aggregates, the water to 
karma and the defilements, air to an improper mode of 
thinking, and space to Buddha-essence> 
58. The aggregates, entrances, and elements 
should be known as being similar to earth. 
The karma and defilements of beings 
are to be known as similar to water. 
Earth is similar to the five aggregates, twelve entrances 
(ayatanas), and eighteen elements (dhatus). The five aggregates 
are form, feeling, cognition, mental formations and 
consciousness. The earth is very coarse or dense and is the 
element that is the basis of life. In the same way the aggregates, 
elements and entrances are the basis of our experiences of 
pleasure and pain. Water spreads everywhere on the earth and 
makes it possible for plants to grow out of the earth. In the 
same way, the positive and negative actions of our life determine 
the quality of our experiences. These activities are motivated 
by defilements and a belief in a sel£ Water is also unstable 
because it glides along, flowing everywhere. In the same way 
the defilements are fluid and unstable. 
59. The improper way of using the mind is similar to wind 
whereas the true nature is like the element of space, 
having no basis iind no abiding. 
234 The Uttaratantra-:- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
60. The improper way of using the mind abides 
within the true nature of mind. 
This improper.way of using the mind gives rise 
to the defilements and to action. 
Deluded thinking is rooted in the basic ignorance that does 
not recognize the essential nature of phenomena. It is similar 
to wind or air in that air is very light and subtle, but animated 
by the slightest movement. Similarly, ignor·ance is very 
subtle. It creates a very slight movement that stirs up karma 
and the defilements. 
Deluded thinking consists basically of the inability to 
recognize the true .nature of mind, while awakened thought 
sees phenomena correctly. For example when a rope in a dark 
place is seen as a snake, the perception of a rope and snake 
produce the ·same visual sensation. However, because the 
thinking is incorrect, the rope is seen differently. One can say 
this deluded thinking rests in the nature of the mind and from 
it arises karma and the defilements. The actual nature of 
phenomena is peace, emptiness and the absence of conceptual 
fabrication. Because one perceives true phenomena incorrectly, 
one incorrectly believes phenomena to be real. The first 
distortion occurs in the perception of"self" and "others." From 
this arises the attachment to "self" and a dislike of what is 
connected to others. Then, from this initial distortion arises 
all of the physical, mental and verbal negatives. In this way the 
basis of delusion arises out of karma. 
61. From the waters of action and the defilements 
arise the aggregates, entrances and elements, 
occurring and disintegrating just like 
all things that have beginning and end. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 235 
Karma (action) and the defilements manifest in the life 
experience of every being. Because of karma and the defilements 
we are born in samsara and experience the various 
manifestations that develop out of the qualities of our karma. 43 
This can be compared to the earth rising out of the water 
element. The water contains many particles of earth that arise 
to come together as solid earth. The solid substance will appear, 
but eventually it will disintegrate into the water element from 
which it was born. In the same way, from the water of 'our 
karma and defilements arise the aggregates, elements, and 
entrances of our experiences. Out of the water of our karma 
emerges birth, old age, sickness and death and we then sink 
back into our karma to begin again. 
62. The nature of mind is like the space element: 
it has neither causes nor conditions 
nor these in combination, 
nor arising, abiding or destruction. 
63. This true nature of mind, clarity, is, like space, unchanging, 
never defiled by desire and so forth, the incidental ills 
which arise from an improper use of the mind. 
64. It is not produced by the waters 
of karma, defilements and so forth, 
nor will it be burnt by the cruel fires of 
aging, sickness and death. 
65. One should know the three fires 
of death, sickness and aging 
to be similar, respectively, to 
the fires which blaze at the end of time, 
hellfire and ordinary fire. 
236 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The true nature of the mind is compared to space because space 
is never created nor is it destroyed. Likewise, the actual nature 
of the mind is changeless, clear, and is not polluted by any 
impurities. Space is not created by water nor is it destroyed by 
fire. Similarly, Buddha-essence is not created by the water of 
karma and the defilements nor destroyed by the fires of old 
age, sickness, and death. The fires of death and old age are 
respectively compared to the fires at of the end of time44 
(hellfire) and ordinary fire. 
Unalterability of Buddha-Essence in the 
Partially Pure Phase 
66. Free from birth, aging, sickness and death, 
they have realized the true nature, just as it is. 
On account of this, the wise 
have awakened compassion for beings and, 
even though free from the sufferings 
of birth and so forth, they demonstrate them. 
67. The deeply-realized have radically removed 
the sufferings of aging, sickness and death. 
They are without them because their birth 
is not brought about by karma and what is defiled. 
Birth consists in acquiring a new set of aggregates in a particular 
life. Sickness and old age are alterations of the aggregates and 
death occurs when the aggregates terminate. The bodhisattvas 
transcend old age, sickness, and death because they have realized 
the true nature of reality. Even though bodhisattvas are free 
from these four states, they are not focused on their own 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vtzjra Point 237 
liberation because the realization of a bodhisattva leads to a 
desire to free others. 
Even though bodhisattvas give the appearance ofbeing born 
and enduring old age, sickness, and death, they do not 
experience suffering themselves. The realized ones, who have 
reached the bodhisattva levels, have eliminated the root of birth, 
old age, sickness, and death because they have eliminated 
karma.45 They have eliminated suffering and the experience of 
suffering because suffering is the fruition of the defilements. 
The bodhisattvas possess the direct realization of emptiness and 
luminous clarity, and therefore have transcended birth, old age, 
sickness, and death. Even though they are beyond these forms 
of suffering, bodhisattvas can see that other beings have not 
experienced emptiness and luminous clarity. This arouses the 
compassion of the bodhisattva and for this reason they continue 
to. manifest these four samsaric states. 
68. Since they have seen the truth, just as it is, 
their compassionate nature shows 
birth, aging, sickness, and death, 
even though they have transcended birth and the rest. 
69. Those blinded by ignorance see the Victors' children, 
who have realized this changeless true nature, 
as though they were born and so forth. 
This is indeed a wonder! 
Describing each bodhisattva leyel, the text begins with the 
"Victors' children" who are all the followers of the Buddha. In 
this context the text refers to those who have reached the first 
bodhisattva level, those who have gained direct rea:lization of 
the true nature of phenomena and have realized Buddha-essence 
without distortion. They possess the "eyes of jnana." Others, 
238 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
who have not experienced this realization, are like the blind. 
The bodhisattvas remain in samsara to help these blind 
individuals. These bodhisattvas do not have to return to samsara 
to help others, but do so out-of compassion. 
70. Those who have reached the domain of reali21ation 
appear within the experience of the immature. 
Thus the skills and compassion of these friends for beings 
are truly excellent. 
Those who have reached the level of the "realized ones" have 
attained the next stage. The Tibetan word for "realized" is phag 
pa, which literally means "higher." These are beings that have 
reached a hi:gher state of being and the term refers to the first 
level of the bodhisattva. One reaches this domain when one 
enters the path of seeing, which is the moment in which 
phenomena can be directly perceived. An ordinary being may 
be traveling on the path of accumulation or the path of 
application (see pg 425}.46 However, on these levels a person 
has not experienced direct insight and therefore is called an 
"immature" being which in Tibetan means "infant." Ordinary 
beings are compared to infants because they cannot eat or take 
care of themselves. The difference between ordinary beings and 
deeply realized beings is entirely a matter of the absence or 
presence of insight into the nature of reality. The realized 
bodhisattvas can manifest all of the suffering in the domain of 
ordinary beings because they possess skillful means. This 
indicates that their realization is changeless and that their 
suffering is an appearance that has been taken on to help others. 
71. Even though they have transcended everything worldly, 
they do not leave the world, 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth ~jra Point 239 
acting within the world for the world 
but unblemished by worldly impurity. 
72. A lotus, born of water, by water remains unblemished. 
Similarly, even though they are born in the world, 
by worldly beings they are unblemished. 
Even though bodhisattvas who have attained the second to 
seventh levels have transcended the defilements and karma, they 
do not depart from the world. When they work in the world, 
they do not become polluted by the defilements because they 
understand the true nature of phenomena. For example, a lotus 
grows in dirty water, but it is pure. In the same way, bodhisattvas 
are immersed in our world but karma, the defilements, or the 
suffering of our world does not pollute them. 
73. In order to accomplish their task, their brilliant 
intelligence is like a fire blazing incessantly. 
They are at all times profoundly immersed 
in meditative union with peace. 
74. Due to previous impetus and being concept-free, 
no e./fort need be made to bring beings to maturity. 
75. They know precisely the ways and means 
to train anyone and whichever teaching, 
physical form, mode of conduct or action 
would be most appropriate. 
76. In this wa~ those of unhindered intelligence 
excellently engage themselves in benefiting 
beings as limitless as the sky, 
continually and spontaneously. 
240 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The main difference between bodhisattvas on the seventh and 
eighth level is that seventh level bodhisattvas experience 
meditation and post-meditation in a slightly different way. It 
is like, for example, if you have dry wood, when lighted it 
catches fire automatically without effortY In the same way, 
bodhisattvas have great ·compassion and for this reason 
automatically help other beings. The bodhisattvas on the eighth 
and ninth levels are constantly immersed in a state of balance, 
meditation on peace. Therefore, when they are helping others 
their mind is always in a perfect state of meditation. There is 
no difference between their meditation and post-meditation. 
77. The way in which these bodhisattvas act in the worlds, 
to help beings, during the post-meditation phase, 
is the same as the tathagatas' way of truly liberating beings. 
78. Although this is true, the differences 
between these bodhisattvas and the Buddhas 
are like those between the Earth and a'n atom 
or between an oxs hoofprint and the ocean. 
Bodhisattvas on the ninth level are very similar to bodhisattvas 
on the eighth level. Bodhisattvas on the tenth level have all the 
qualities of bodhisattvas on the eighth and ninth levels, but 
they have developed even further. As a result of their actions in 
previous lives, they have gathered a great amount of virtue, 
spiritual energy, and knowledge. They can help beings without 
any effort and do not have to think, "I must help," because 
they don't believe in the substantiality of objects. When they 
act, it is completely spontaneous like wood being placed on a 
fire. Even though this action is automatic, it is extremely precise 
so that by sitting, coming and going they can teach the dharma. 
They choose a particular style that helps beings directly, know 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 241 
exactly when to act, and know how to act. Some beings, for 
example, need miracles and clairvoyance; others need only to 
observe very pure conduct; still others need only to hear the 
dharma. Buddha activity arises when it is needed, not a few 
days earlier or a few days later. 
The activity of bodhisattvas on the tenth level goes 
everywhere and embraces everyone. It is compared to space. 
There are infinite numbers ofbeings everywhere and the extent 
of their negative karma is inconceivable. In response, the activity 
of the bodhisattvas goes on continuously and manifests 
spontaneously. These bodhisattvas act without hindrances and 
interference of conceptuality. They are always in meditation. 
The activities of these bodhisattvas are practically the same -as 
the Buddhas. 48 The difference, however, between tenth level 
bodhisattvas and the Buddhas can be compared to the difference 
between the Earth and an atom or the difference between the 
ocean and water found in a hoof-print; there is a vast difference 
in the degree in which they manifest. 
Unalterability of Buddha-Essence in the 
Completely Pure Phase 
79. Because it has inexhaustible qualities, 
its nature is not to alter. 
It is the refuge of beings 
because it has no limits in the foture. 
Right to th_~ very end, it is always non-dual 
because it is non-conceptual. 
It is also of indestructible character 
because it is non--compounded, by nature. 
242 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
80. This has no birth because it is permanent, 
no death because it is enduring, 
no ailment because it is peace and 
no aging because it is unchanging. 
81. It has no birth in a mental form because 
it is permanent. 
It has no inconceivable death and transmigration, 
because it is everlasting. 
One may incorrectly think that when bodhisattvas have 
achieved the last stage of perfect Buddhahood, their Buddha­
essence improves. But it does not change for four reasons: 
$ Permanence. In the pure phase, Buddha-essence is the 
dharmakaya in which all of the qualities are inherently present, 
so it cannot change or deteriorate and therefore is permanent. 
$ Everlasting. Being beyond birth and death it is eternal. 
It manifests Buddha activity that will never end thus it is the 
constant refuge of beings .. 
$ Non-dual. The dharmakaya or stainless dharmadhatu 
is non-dual because within it is the sameness of samsara and 
nirvana and everything is pacified because there are no 
conceptual differences. 
$ Immutability. The fourth quality is indestructibility. 
Because it is not created by defilements or karma, it cannot be 
destroyed. It is present from the beginning. Because it has not 
been created it is indestructible. 
In more detail: 
Buddha-essence is unalterable because it has no birth, no 
beginning. It has no death because it has no end. It is free from 
sickness because it does not alternate between good and bad. It 
does not age because it is indestructible. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 243 
When Buddhahood is achieved, there is no change in the 
physical body; there is also no change in the subtle body. In 
Buddhahood there is no body. Buddha-essence manifests as 
dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, to Buddhas, 
bodhisattvas and ordinary beings respectively. The word "kaya'' 
literally means "body," or "embodiment." In the nirmanakaya 
it appears as if the individual is taking birth and has a real body, 
but in the true sense this is only an appearance of physical 
form. 49 The dharmakaya is beyond the four extremes and eight 
fabrications. 5° For this reason it is not connected with a body 
in the ordinary sense. 
Buddhahood is free from birth because it is permanent. It 
has no death because it is eternal. There is no death in the 
ordinary sense, and even very subtle changes are absent. This is 
why the Buddha can protect and help all beings until the end 
of samsara. 
82. It is unharmed by the disease of the finer imprints of 
karma because it is peace. 
It has no aging produced by untainted karma 
because it is immutable. 
83. This uncreated space has the attributes of permanence, 
etc., which should be known respectively 
through the first pair of verses, and likewise the next pair 
and the next pair and the last. 
84.51 Being endowed with inexhaustible qualities, 
it has the attribute of permanence, 
the quality of not altering. 
Because it equals the furthest end, 
its attribute is everlasting, the nature of a refuge. 
Because its very character is not to conceptualize, 
244 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
it has the attribute of peace: the non-dual true nature. 
As its qualities are not things fabricated, 
its attribute is immutability -the changeless nature. 
Buddhahood is not harmed by sickness because it is peace that 
overcomes the duality of samsara and nirvana. Since this 
dualistic division has ended, there is no suffering or sickness 
even from the fine karmic imprints that lead to very subtle 
suffering. Buddhahood never ages or manifests the degradation 
of the stream of existence. The Buddhas do not age or evidence 
any degradation, even in a subtle way, from the untainted factors 
because Buddhahood is immutable. 
In summary, uncreated space refers to the aspect of 
emptiness, while Buddha-essence refers to the luminous clarity 
aspect. The name "Buddha-essence" indicates that it can bring 
forth all of the qualities of the Buddha. Therefore, uncreated 
space can be said to possess the attributes of permanence, 
eternity, non-duality, and immutability. Each refers to a 
different quality: the absence of birth to permanence; the 
absence of death to eternity; the absence of sickness to non­
duality; and the absence of old age to immutability. So these 
qualities are unalterable. 
In the ordinary world good qualities wear out, but the 
qualities of Buddhahood are permanent because the body, 
speech, and mind of the Buddha are inexhaustible and 
changeless and therefore permanent. The vast numbers of beings 
on this earth are beset with negative karma that creates an almost 
inexhaustible amount of impurities. Buddha activity helps to 
purify these beings, continually, for as long as samsara lasts, so 
these qualities must be eternal. Buddhahood is also a refuge 
because it is there to help beings. The third quality is non­
duality. In Buddhahood there is no distinction between good 
and evil, Buddha-essence is beyond this dualism and is therefore 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth vajra Point 245 
in a state of peace. The last quality is that of indestructibility. 
Buddhahood never vanishes because the qualities of 
Buddhahood are not fabricated. 
At the impure level of ordinary beings the aggregates and 
the four elements change while Bud.dha-essence is changeless, 
in the same way that space is changeless. In the mixed phase 
the Buddha-essence remains changeless even though 
bodhisattvas work for the benefit of all beings. In the phase of 
total purity the Buddha-essence is changeless even though the 
Buddhas help all beings. So Buddha-essence is changeless. 
10. Inseparability of the Qualities 
84. (Cont'd.) It is the dharmakaya. It is the tathagata. 
It is the highest truth. It is the ultimately-true nirvana. 
Like the sun and its rays, these aspects are inseparable: 
thus there is no nirvana apart from Buddhahood itself 
85. In brief, since the meaning of this untainted domain 
is classified intO' four aspects, dharmakaya and so forth, 
the latter should be known as four synonyms for it: 
86. that inseparable from the Buddha qualities, 
the achievement of the potential, just as it is, 
the true nature, neither false nor unreliable and 
that having, from time immemorial 
the very nature of peace. 
87. Buddhahood is every aspect oftru'e, 
perfect· enlightenment. 
Nirvana is tqtal removal of impurities and conditioning. 
In the true sense, these are not different. 
246 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
88. The characteristic of liberation 
is to be inseparable from its qualities -
replete, numberless, inconceivable and stainless. 
This liberation is the tathagata. 
Buddha-essence is giyert four different names: the 
"dh k , " h , "h" h h" d " arma aya, tat agata, 1g est trut an supreme . , n1rvana. 
~ It is called the "dharmakaya'' because it is the true nature 
of all things. 
~ It is called the "tathagata'' because it is the ultimate 
fruition of seeing exactly what is. 
~ It is called the truth of the realized ones or the "highest 
truth" because the realized ones see the nature of phenomena. 
~ It is called the "supreme nirvana'' because it is beyond 
the suffering of samsara. 
The inseparability of the four qualities resembles the 
inseparability of the sun and the sunshine. One cannot have 
one without the other. The dharmakaya, the tathagata, the 
highest truth and the supreme nirvana are inseparable whether 
it manifests at the stage of ordinary beings, bodhisattvas, or 
Buddhas. When Buddhahood is achieved, there is no higher 
nirvana and there are no other truths. 
Untainted space is divided into the four aspects of the 
dharmakaya, the tathagata, the highest truth, and ultimate or 
supreme nirvana. The "dharmakaya" is the sum of all the 
qualities manifested by the Buddha (the ten powers, four 
fearlessnesses, etc.) and these qualities are inseparable from it. 
The term "tathagata'' is used to indicate that from the beginning 
of time, the ground that is the cause of Buddhahood has been 
within all beings. The term "highest truth" indicates that the 
true nature is always present, that it contains no falsehoods. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth ~jra Point 247 
The term "nirvana'' means beyond suffering because this nature 
is free from all impurities. There is no pain or suffering. 
At the level of fruition Buddhahood all the aspects of 
knowledge are the Buddha. All the aspects of knowledge are 
directed towards achieving knowledge of the true nature, the 
knowledge of variety of phenomena, and also totally removing 
all impurities and karmic imprints. The ultimate is 
Buddhahood, which is a state of complete knowledge and 
complete purity. At the level of the ultimate, however, 
Buddhahood and nirvana are not separate. 
Liberation is the direct realization of phenomena by seeing 
it exactly as it is. Liberation has the characteristics of being 
inseparable, numberless, unthinkable and stainless. All these 
qualities are complete in the dharmakaya. 
The following example illustrates that when some of the 
parts are missing, the whole cannot exist. The example in verse 
92 shows the inseparability of different parts of a whole. 
88. (Cont'd.) Compare this to artists specialized in drawing, 
one part or another of the body. 
However, whichever part one knew, 
the others had not fully mastered. 
89. Their king and ruler gives them a canvas, 
with the order, 
'All of you must now paint my picture. ' 
90. HaV,ipg 'received the command, 
they commence the painting as best they can. 
However, one of them departs, 
leaving for some far and foreign land. 
248 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
91. Since this man was missing, 
through having gone to another land, 
the portrait, in all its parts, could not be finished. 
This is the example. 
Imagine some artists, each skilled in painting just one part of 
the body so that one artist can draw, for example, the eyes 
and another can draw just the arms, another just the hair, etc. 
Now a king gathers these artists together and gives them a 
canvas and asks them to do his portrait. In the middle of the 
painting, one of the artists leaves the country so that the 
portrait can't be completed. 
92. The artists are generosity, right conduct, patience, 
and so on. 
Voidness, endowed with every finest aspect 
is said to be like the royal portrait. 
Buddhahood is similar to the completed picture and each artist 
represents the different qualities necessary to achieve 
Buddhahood. If all the qualities of the six paramitas are 
present, then all the conditions for reaching Buddhahood are 
also present and emptiness can be apprehended directly. 
Emptiness with ~ll the aspects is like the fully completed 
portrait of the king. This emptiness is not devoid of qualities, 
but is the great fullness of these qualities especially the quality 
of luminous clarity in which all these aspects of knowledge 
can flourish. For this emptiness to be fully apprehended, all 
the qualities of the paramitas must be present just as all the 
artists must be present to complete the portrait. 
93. Prajna, jnana, and perfect liberation are like 
the sun's light, beams, and orb, 
Buddha-Essence -The Fourth Vajra Point 249 
because respectively bright, radiant and pure, 
and being inseparable. 
94. Therefore, until the achievement of Buddhahood, 
nirvana is never achieved, 
just as without sunlight and sunbeams, 
the sun could never be seen. 
The inseparability of the qualities of prajna, jnana and liberation 
is illustrated by using the example of the sun. The Tibetan word 
for "prajna'' is sherab, which literally means "better knowledge." 
Prajna means an understanding that is without distortion of 
both the nominal and phenomenal aspect of phenomena. J nana 
(Tib. yeshe) means very clear cognition and it pr~vides 
knowledge of the essential or nominal aspect of phenomena. 
One doesn't need to use his or her jnana to gain knowledge 
about a river or a mountain. J nana provides knowledge of the 
true nature of things. These two qualities are present in ordinary 
beings as seeds that fully manifest at Buddhahood. At the stage 
of ordinary beings when· impurities are removed, the third 
quality of perfect liberation emerges. Prajna, jnana and 
liberation from impurities can be compared to sunlight, the 
rays of the sun and the orb of the sun, which are luminous, 
radiant and pure respectively. 
This example demonstrates that without sunlight and the 
sun's rays the sun cannot be seen. Similarly, nirvana is not 
possible without the jnana of the Buddha. In just this way, the 
qualities of til.~ Buddha are inseparable. 
C. Nine Examples of Buddha-Essence 
95. Thus has the Victors' essence been described 
through a tenfold presentation. 
250 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
One should understand, from the following examples, 
its presence within the confines of the defilements. 
96. Similar to a Buddha in a decaying lotus, 
honey amidst bees, grains in their husks, 
gold in filth, a treasure under the ground, 
shoots and the like piercing through fruits, 
a Buddha statue inside tattered rags, 
97. a monarch in a poor and wretched woman's womb, 
or a precious image inside some clay, 
this nature is present within all beings 
but obscured by the impurity of passing defilement. 
98. The impurities correspond to the lotus, the insects, 
the husks, filth, the ground, the fruit, the tattered rags, 
the woman severely afflicted by burning sorrows, and clay. 
The Buddha, honey, grains, gold, treasure, 
a mighty tree, precious statue, 
supreme ruler of the continents and precious image 
correspond to this supreme, immaculate nature. 
One may still be confused about the fact that Buddha-essence 
is changeless, but does not manifest because of impurities. To 
illustrate this, nine examples of Buddha-essence and the 
impurities are provided. 
When the Buddha gave teachings, he did not simply declare 
the truth, he gave reasons for what he claimed. The reasons for 
what was taught were sometimes very apparent and at other 
times very obscure. The obvious teachings were the ones that 
could be grasped by the senses. There are, however, teachings 
that cannot be grasped by the sensory faculties because they 
concern things that are very far away, or very remote in time, 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 251 
or that are related to karma. For example, a particular karma 
will prevent one from living certain types of lives. Since one 
cannot understand these more obscure meanings directly, it is 
necessary to employ inference. For instance, if we say that there 
is a fire behind a hill because we can see smoke, people believe 
that this is true because even though they cannot see the actual 
fire smoke is a valid sign of a fire. For a sign to be significant it 
must have universal applicability i.e., whenever there is a fire, 
there must be smoke. The sign must also be valid, for instance, 
if we say that there is a fire because I see a tree, it is an invalid 
sign. So a sign that indicates the presence of something that is 
hidden must have universal applicability and be a valid sign. 
The presence of Buddha-essence is illustrated by signs related 
to nine examples. This reasoning is then applied to Buddha­
essence itself. 
The nine examples of beautiful things covered up by 
impurities are listed along with the nine impurities, followed 
by a list of the pure things that have been covered up. These 
will be elaborated below. The method for presenting each 
example is the same: first a verse describes the example, then a 
verse provides its meaning, finally a verse explains the parallel 
between the example and Buddha-essence. 
First example: A Buddha in a decaying lotus 
99. Someone endowed with pure divine vision, upon seeing 
a tathagata shining and adorned with a thousand signs, 
within a decaying lotus, would remove him from the prison 
formed by the petals of the 'water born. ' 
100. Simila_rly the sugatas, with their Buddha eyes, 
see their own true nature even in those in the worst of hells. 
Their nature being compassion present until the very end, 
they bring freedom from all those veils. 
252 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
101. Once the sugata within the closed, decaying lotus 
had been seen by one with divine vision, 
the petals were .sliced asunder. 
Likewise, when the Buddhas see 
the essence of perfect Buddhahood in beings, 
yet obscured by an impure shell of desire, hatred and so on, 
these Victors, through compassion, destroy such obscuration. 
Imagine an ugly, withered lotus covering a beautiful statue of 
the Buddha. Someone with clairvoyance could see the statue 
and think that this was not a good place for such a beautiful 
statue. They would break open the lotus shell and remove the 
statue. Similarly, Buddha-essence is in the mind of all beings, 
even those in the worst hell, but it is obscured by the defilements 
of the three poisons. The Buddhas who possess divine vision 
and great corn:passion see this Buddha-essence and help beings 
out of the shell of their defilements. Individuals with Buddha­
essence need to reach Buddhahood so they do not continue to 
suffer in samsara. Therefore beings need the Buddhas with their 
vision and their teachings to receive the tools that will make 
this Buddha-essence manifest. 
Second example: Honey amid bees 
102. A clever person trying to get the honey amid the swarm 
would, having spotted it, employ skillful means 
to. separate that honey from the host of bees 
and then actually take hold of it. 
103. Likewise, the great sages with their omniscient vision, 
upon seeing the honey-like causal basis, the essence, 
bring total radical relinquishment of bee-like obscurations. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 253 
104. The person trying to get honey surrounded by myriad 
bees disperses them all and procures the honey just as 
planned. 
The untainted intelligence in at! beings is like the honey. 
The Buddhas, skil!fol victors over bee-like defilements, 
are like the person. 
Imagine some tasty honey that is surrounded by swarming bees. 
If an experienced person knows how to separate the honey from 
the bees, then people can enjoy the honey. The Buddhas with 
the omniscient eyes of twofold knowledge can see the Buddha­
essence in all beings, which is like the honey. The bees circling 
the honey can be removed because they are not part of the 
honey. In the same way, the impurities of beings are not part of 
their Buddha-essence and therefore can be removed allowing 
Buddha-essence to manifest. In this example, the man who 
~ows about honey is like the Buddhas who are skilled in 
removing obscurations, which are the bees. 
Third example: Grains in their husks 
105. Humans cannot use kernels of grains still in 
their hush 
Whoever wants them as food must de-husk them. 
106. Similarly, while Buddhahood, present in all beings 
but combined with defilement impurities, 
has not been .freed .fro~ the defilements, 
Buddha activity in the three realms will' not be 
accomplished. 
107. lncomple,tely-threshed kernels of rice, buckwheat 
and barley that are not folly de-husked still have husks 
and beards. 
254 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
just as these are not usable, tasty food for humans 
likewise the 'lord of all qualities, 'present in living beings, 
and whose form has not yet been freed from defilements, 
will not give the taste of dharma joy 
to beings afflicted by the hunger of defilements. 
Imagine a grain of rice enclosed in its husk. Kernels of rice, 
buckwheat and barley cannot be used as food when they have 
not been husked. Similarly, as long as Buddha-essence, called 
"the lord of all qualities," is not liberated from the shell of 
impurities, it cannot provide the taste of the joy of dharma 
to beings. 
Fourth example: Gold in filth 
108. The gold of a man on a journey fell 
into a place containing much rotting filth. 
Being itself of incorruptible nature 
the gold remained there for many a century 
in that same place yet quite unchanged. 
109. A god with great divine vision, upon noticing it there, 
told someone, 'There is gold here. Once you have cleansed 
this most prized thing, do what can be done 
with such a precious substance. ' 
110. In a similar way, the Victors see the quality of beings, 
which has sunken into the filth-like defilements 
and shower upon them a rain of true dharma 
that they may be purified of defilement's mire. 
111. just as the gold fallen into the place rotting with 
garbage was seen there by a god who, with great insistence, 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 255 
showed the man that most beautifUl of things 
so that it might be completely cleansed, 
so also do the Victors perceive 
that most precious perfect Buddhahood 
within all beings has fallen in defilement's great mire. 
Therefore they teach them all the dharma 
in order that they may be purified. 
Imagine an individual who has gone on a journey and on his 
way he loses some pure gold which falls into a pile of rubbish. 
The gold remains unchanged for hundreds of years but is quite 
useless. Then a god with clairvoyance sees the large lump of 
gold in the rubbish and tells someone where to find it so the 
gold can be put to proper use. 
Similarly, the Buddhas can see the pure Buddha-essence of 
beings which has fallen into the filth of defilements and which 
has been lying there for thousands of years. Even though the 
gold has fallen: into this filth, it has not been polluted by the 
defilements. If there were no rubbish, there would be no need 
for the clairvoyant. Also, if there had been no gold for the 
clairvoyant person to discover this example would not have 
meaning. Similarly, if Buddha-essence were not obscured by 
defilements, there would be no need for the Buddhas to enter 
this world and teach sentient beings about it. Also if beings did 
not have Buddha-essence from the very beginning, there would 
be no need for the Buddhas to give teachings because it would 
be impossible for individuals to attain Buddhahood. But this 
is not the ~ase and this is why the Buddhas give teachings and 
point out ~ur obscurations. They do this by producing the rain 
of dharma that has the ability to gradually wash away the 
impurities that we have accumulated. 
Gold is very useful, but ifit is covered by rubbish it is useless. 
This is why this clairvoyant person tells someone where the gold 
256 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
is and tells him to remove the rubbish and use what he has found. 
In the same way, the Buddhas tell us about the rubbish of our 
instability. They see beings that have the wish-fulfilling gem in 
their hands, but are wasting ,it. Beings are suffering, and they 
have the tool to eliminate their suffering and this is why the 
Buddhas teach the dharma. Beings remain stuck in problems 
and difficulties and don't have the power to realize their own 
goals. They might think there is nothing they can do, but they 
already possess the knowledge of the true nature and the variety 
of phenomena latent within. They have everything necessary to 
remove the defilements. The Buddha has explained that if they 
practice, they can reach enlightenment. 
Fifth example: A treasure buried beneath the earth 
112. Were there an inexhaustible treasure underground, 
beneath a poor man's hovel 
neither 
would he know of its presence 
nor could the treasure tell him, 'I am here.' 
113. Similarly, as they have not realized 
the very precious treasure contained within their mind, 
the immaculate nature to which nothing need be added 
and from which nothing need be taken, beings 
continually experience many varied sufferings 
of deprivation. 
114. The jewel treasure contained in the poor man's house 
cannot tell him, 'L the precious treasure, am here' 
and the man would never know it to be there. 
All beings, who possess the dharmakaya treasure 
within the mansion of their mind, resemble the pauper. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vtljra Point 257 
Hence the Great Sages have taken worldly birth, perfectly, 
so that those beings may obtain the treasure. 
Imagine a man so poor that he doesn't have any food or clothes, 
who is living in a house built over a great treasure. If the man 
doesn't know about the treasure, he will contipue to suffer in 
poverty because the treasure cannot say, "Look, I am here." 
Similarly, all beings have the great treasure of Buddha-essence 
in their mind and this treasure has always been there. They do 
not see the Buddha-essence in their mind so they endure all 
the sufferings of samsara. The treasure can't tell the man, "I am 
here" even though it is very close by. Similarly, all beings have 
the precious treasure of the dharmakaya locked in their mind, 
but continue to suffer. Therefore the Great Sages, the Buddhas, 
come into our world to help beings find this treasure. 
Sixth example: Seeds within a fruit 
115. just as, in the seeds of mangoes and other fruits, 
the imperishable quality of germinating 
meeting the presence of prepared soil water and so forth, 
will gradually produce the body of a regal tree, 
116. so also, within the 'rind' confine of beings' ignorance 
and the like, is contained the pure dharma nature. 
When this is sustained by virtue it will gradually attain 
the very substance of a 'King ofVictors.' 
117. just as a tree grows from within 
the skin of a banana or mango fruit, 
due to conditions -humidity, sunlight, air, soil 
space and time, 
likewise is the seed and germ of perfect Buddhahood 
contained within the skin of that fruit: 
258 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
sentient beings' defilements. 
Due to the condition, virtue, this true nature 
will be seen and augment. 
A very tiny seed in a fruit has the power to be an enormous 
tree. One cannot see the tree in the seed, but if one adds all the 
right conditions for growth such as water, sunlight, soil, etc. to 
the seed, a mighty tree will develop. Similarly, Buddha-essence 
exists in all beings but is encased in the peel of ignorance that 
generates our emotional and cognitive obscurations. If one 
practices virtue, it will generate the favorable conditions for 
this seed of Buddha-essence to grow. Throughthe accumulation 
of knowledge and virtue, the seed will develop into the "King 
ofVictors" or Buddhahood. The parallel is that just as a tree 
with the proper conditions grows from a seed enclosed by the 
skin of a fruit into a tree, Buddha-essence is enclosed in the 
skin of defilements and with proper conditions will manifest 
as Buddhahood. 
Seventh example: A Buddha image wrapped in tattered rags 
118. A god, having discovered a precious image of a 
tathagata by the road, yet wrapped in smelly, tattered rags, 
would tell someone about it lying there, on the roadside, 
in order that it be recovered. 
119. Similarly, when those of unhindered vision, 
the Buddhas, 
see the very substance of the tathagatas 
(present even in animals), 
but wrapped within the envelope of defilement, 
they also show the means by which it may be set ftee. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth ~jra Point 259 
120. A god with divine vision who had perceived the image 
of the tathagata, precious by nature, yet wrapped 
in smelly rags and lying by the roadside 
would point it out to people, that it might be freed. 
just like that, the Victors see Buddha-essence (even in 
animals} lying by samsaras road, 
wrapped in defilements' tatters, 
and they teach the dharma in order that it be liberated. 
Imagine a very valuable Buddha statue wrapped in tattered rags 
and abandoned by the side of the road. A passerby would not 
notice it, but if a god came along, he could see the statue. 
Similarly, the Buddhas with their jnana can see that the Buddha­
essence of beings is wrapped in the tattered rags of the 
defilements. They see this in persons and even in animals. As a 
god can see a statue with divine vision, the Buddhas can see 
Buddha-essence lying on the road of samsara inside the rags of 
defilements. They tell beings to remove the tattered rags so the 
Buddha-essence can manifest in its complete purity. 
Eighth example: A future king in the womb of a 
wretched woman 
121. A wretched woman, having no. one to whom to turn 
and living in·a pauper hostel, may hold the glory 
of a future king within her womb 
yet not know this ruler of men to be present within her. 
122. Worldly existence is like the pauper hostel 
and impure beings are like the pregnant woman. 
Having this ·being within her, she has a protector 
and the embryo is like the immaculate nature. 
260 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
123. The woman is dressed in dirty clothes, 
her form is unpleasant and she must endure, 
in the pauper home, the worst of sorrows 
even though a ruler dwells within. her womb. 
Similarly, even though a protector resides within, 
beings believe themselves undefended and never find 
peace of mind. By defilements overpowered, 
they remain in 'the ground of suffering. ' 
Imagine a destitute ugly woman with no place to stay who 
ends up in a pauper's hostel. Also imagine that she is pregnant 
and holds in her womb the future king. She continues to suffer 
because she doesn't know that she is bearing a king. Similarly, 
beings hold the precious Buddha-essence but do not know that 
they do or get any benefit from it. As the woman in the hostel 
has a king in her womb, so beings are born in the six realms of 
samsara; 52 some as humans, some as animals, some as hungry 
ghosts, etc (see pg. 424). All have to suffer -animals suffer 
from enslavement, spirits have to suffer from thirst and hunger, 
humans have to suffer from birth, sickness, old age and death. 
All are like the poor woman living in misery. 
The poor woman with a great ruler in her womb is dressed 
i_n dirty clothes. Because she doesn't know that she bears a king, 
she remains in poverty and is very unhappy. In the same way, 
beings have a protector inside their mind, but are unaware of 
this. They have no peace of mind and are overpowered by 
defilements. Thus they remain in samsara and undergo all kinds 
of suffering. 
Ninth example: A golden statue in a clay mould 
124. Upon seeing a complete and peaceful statue, 
cast in gold yet still within its clay mould, 
externally like clay, 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 261 
those who know remove the outer covering 
to expose the gold that lies within. 
125. The perfectly enlightened perfectly see that the 
nature of mind, 
luminous clarity, is covered by transient impurities. 
Hence, they cleanse beings, who are like mines 
of precious gems, of their obscurations. 
126. just as an expert removes all the clay, knowing the 
nature of the peaceful statue contained in the bright, 
stainless gold, 
likewise the omniscient know mental peace, 
like cleansed gold. 
Chipping away, by means of dharma explanation, 
they clean away each and every obscuration. 
Imagine a very pure statue covered with a crust of clay. Someone 
who knew about this could remove the clay and reveal the gold 
statue. In the same way, the clear light nature of the mind is 
inside us, but covered with impurities. These impurities are 
not permanent and can be removed like the clay crust covering 
the beautiful statue. Someone knowing that the clay is covering 
the statue can remove the clay gradually to reveal the gold statue. 
In the same way, the omniscient ones know with their jnana 
that Buddha-essence is inside beings and through teaching the 
dharma they can gradually remove all the impurities covering 
the pure mind. 
Recapitulation of the nine examples and their meaning 
127. Within the lotus, bees, husk, filth, ground, fruit skin, 
tattered rags, woman's womb and the clay mould are 
262 The Uttaratantra- A Treatue on Buddha-Essence 
128. the Buddha, honey, kernel, gold, treasure, great tree, 
precious image, universal monarch and golden figure. 
129. Similarly it is said that the shell of defilement 
covering the nature of beings is beginningless 
and unconnected with it and that the stainlessness 
of that nature of mind is beginningless. 
130. Desire, aversion and ignorance and these in active state 
or as latent imprints to be abandoned through insight, 
or to be abandoned through cultivation (of insight) -
the impurities present in the impure 
and the impurities present in the pure -
131. are nine things illustrated by 
the example of the lotus 'shell' and so forth. 
The 'shell' of subsidiary defilements 
divides into infinite categories. 
132. Summarized briefly, the nine impurities, desire, etc., 
have been well illustrated through nine examples, 
the lotus 'shell' and so forth respectively. 
133. The impurities cause, respectively, 
the four impurities of ordinary beings, 
one of arhats, two of beings training in dharma 
and two impurities of the wise. 
These nine examples show that all beings have Buddha-essence, 
but the essence does not manifest because it is covered by 
impurities. The Buddhas can see the Buddha-essence and 
therefore they teach the dharma that explains how the impurities 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 263 
can be removed. Because beings possess Buddha-essence, 
through purification Buddhahood can be reached. 
In summary, there are nine examples of the impurities. If 
one has a white shell, for example, one cannot separate the 
whiteness from the roundness of the shell. However, Buddha­
essence is completely separate from the impurities. For this 
reason these impurities fall away when Buddha-essence 
manifests. 
Each of the nine examples corresponds to one of the 
defilements and to a level of the path. To summarize: 
example 
1. the lotus 
2. the bee swarm 
3. withered rice 
4. gold in filth 
5. buried treasure 
6. fruit represents defilement as 
the shell corresponds to 
attachment found in ordinary 
beings. 
the bees correspond to 
aggression found in ordinary 
beings. 
the husk corresponds to 
ignorance found in ordinary 
beings. 
the filth corresponds to 
attachment, aggression, and 
ignorance in a very active state 
found in ordinary beings. 
the soil corresponds to the latent 
karmic traces of attachment, 
aggression and ignorance left 
behind in arhats. 
the skin corresponds to 
fabricated obscurations worked 
on by those on the path of 
264 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
insight by bodhisattvas on the 
Mahayana path. 
7. the statue in rags the rags correspond to the innate 
obscurations worked on by 
those on the path of 
cultivation by bodhisattvas on 
the Mahayana path. 
8. the pregnant woman her womb represents the 
impurities of the bodhisattva 
abiding in the first to seventh 
bodhisattva levels. 
9. the statue in day the day represents the impurities 
In more detail: of the bodhisattva abiding in 
the eighth to tenth 
bodhisattva levels. 
134. The mind is delighted by the 'mud-born,' the lotus, 
but later becomes disappointed: such is desire's happiness. 
135. When irritated, bees sting. Likewise, anger arises 
and brings suffering to the heart. 
136. just as kernels of rice and other grains are covered 
outwardly by husks and skins, 
so is the vision of the very essence 
obscured by the shell' of ignorance. 
137. Filth is something unpleasant. 
Akin to it is the active state, 
causing those who are involved to indulge in gratification 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vttjra Point 265 
138. When the wealth was covered over, they did not know 
and could not obtain its treasures. 
In a similar way, the spontaneously-arising 
is concealed by ignorance's latent traces. 
139. just as the germ and so forth split 
the husk of their grain, through a gradual growth, 
likewise insight into thatness dispels 
the obscurations to be abandoned through insight. 
A lotus is a beautiful flower that grows out of mud. When 
one sees a lotus blooming, it is very beautiful and one is happy 
seeing it. Later when it withers, one's pleasure disappears. In 
a similar way, desire comes out of the mind of samsara and 
when something desirable or attractive first presents itself, it 
might bring pleasure, but with time it loses its appeal and 
becomes suffering. 
Bees are very attached to their honey; when the honey is 
touched they become very angry or irritated and give pain to 
others by stinging them. So when the bees are hurt, they hurt 
others. In the same way, when one is angry, one is very irritable 
and one hurts others with harsh words or actions. 
Grains such as rice are covered with a husk that obscures 
the grain inside. In the same way, ignorance keeps one from 
seeing the true nature of phenomena. It is a thick covering like 
a shell or husk that prevents one from seeing what is enclosed. 
Filth qr rubbish covering gold is very unpleasant and 
disagreeable. In the same way when attachment, aggression, 
and ignorance are very strong, they are very repulsive and also 
increase one-'s attachment to pleasures. 
The soil covers the treasure so that one does not know a 
treasure is there. In the same way, very fine mental imprints caused 
by ignorance are present in the mind. This is the innate ignorance 
266 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
present since the beginning of time that covers up the true 
nature of the mind so one cannot recognize its true nature. 
When one is on the path to enlightenment as an ordinary 
being, one travels the path of accumulation and the path of 
application. One practices because that is the goal, but this 
practice may involve little actual realization. After a while one 
obtains a direct insight into the nature of phenomena and 
becomes a bodhisattva who sees "the rope as a rope." At this 
point all misconceptions are relinquished. This is the path of 
cultivation of insight that can be compared to a shoot growing 
from the skin of a fruit. When one has reached this path of 
insight, jnana begins to manifest. 
140. Those who, by following the path of the, realized, 
have overcome the very pith, beliefs 
that the destructible and multiple is a self, 
still have obscurations to be abandoned, 
through the primordial wisdom of the path of cultivation. 
These have been illustrated as being like tattered rags. 
On the path of insight or seeing (the third of the five paths), 
the coarse obscurations are eliminated but we don't 
automatically reach Buddhahood. We have been in samsara for 
such a long time that we have acquired very strong mental 
habits. The gross misconceptions have been removed, but the 
innate ignorance that has been present from the very beginning 
still remains in the form of a trace. After we attain the insight 
of the true nature, we need to cultivate this insight until it 
becomes very firm. This path of cultivation is called the path 
of the realized ones. At this time the core of the belief in a self 
(called the "multitude of fears" because it causes great fear) is 
removed. This can be compared to tattered rags that are so 
rotten they are quite easy to remove. In the same way, at the 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 267 
path of cultivation, mental impurities are quite soft, subtle and 
easy to remove. 
141. The impurities which remain in the seven profound 
levels are compared to the impurities in the confines of 
a womb. 
Release from them is like freedom from. that womb 
whereas non-conceptual jnana is like final maturation. 
The eighth example corresponds to the impurities in the first 
seven bodhisattva levels. These are compared to a baby in the 
womb. The baby must develop there for nine months and with 
each day it is aware that it is closer to being born. Similarly, a 
bodhisattva at each stage is growing more complete as impurities 
are removed and jnana continually matures. 
142. The impurities related in the three profound levels 
should be known as similar to the traces of clay. 
These are the ones to be eliminated by 
the vajra-like samadhi of the 'great self' 
The ninth example relates to the very fine impurities of the 
last three bodhisattva levels which must be eliminated. These 
can be compared to traces of clay covering a statue. These great 
beings, the bodhisattvas on the tenth level, remove these slight 
impurities through vajra-like samadhi. This can be compared 
to a vajra h<;cause it is very powerful and solid; it can destroy 
everything and yet not be destroyed itself. 
143. Thus nine impurities, desire and so forth, 
correspond to the lotus and other (examples). 
Buddha-essence corresponds to the Buddha and so on, 
being the union of three natures. 
268 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
144. Its three natures are the dharmakaya, 
tathata and gotra, 
to be understood respectively 
through three, one, and five examples. 
There is an aspect of purity associated with each of the nine 
examples. Buddha-essence is the union of three natures: 
dharmakaya, the suchness, and the causal ground. The 
dharmakaya refers to the luminous clarity aspect, the suchness 
to the emptiness aspect, and the causal ground to the aspect of 
full manifestation. If one has a shell that is white and round, 
one can say that from the aspect of color it is white, from the 
aspect of shape it is round; however, the whiteness and 
roundness are insegarable. In the same way the luminous clarity, 
voidness, and the causal ground, which are the ability to 
manifest as Buddhahood are also inseparable. Of the nine 
examples there are three examples associated with the 
dharmakaya, one example associated with suchness, and five 
examples associated with the causal ground. 
145. The dharmakaya should be known as two: 
the perfectly immaculate c(harmadhatu 
and the favorable conditions for it-
the teachings in their profound and manifold aspects. 
146. As it transcends the world, there is no example for it 
manifestation within the world, thus it has been represented 
by representing the essence to the form of a Tathagata. 
147. The teachings in their subtle and profound aspect 
should be known to be like the unique taste of honey. 
The teachings in their manifold aspect 
are like the various grains in their husks. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth ~jra Point 269 
The above three examples are associated with the dharmakaya. 
The dharmakaya can be divided into the actual dharmakaya 
and the relative dharmakaya, which is also called dharmakaya, 
but is not the actual dharmakaya. The true dharmakaya is the 
stainless dharmadhatu, the actual Buddha-essence, which is by 
nature luminous clarity and manifests in the domain of self­
cognizant jnana. Relative dharmakaya is called the "teaching 
dharmakaya" which are the scriptures that teach the meaning 
ofthe dharmakaya. These scriptures are deep in that they are 
related to the dharmakaya and vast because they are suited to 
the various mentalities of beings. 
The first example is of the true dharmakaya that cannot be 
fathomed. For that reason it is represented by the Buddha in a 
withering lotus. 
The second example, of honey, represents the teaching 
dharmakaya because the taste of honey is very subtle, as are the 
teachings of the dharmakaya. Honey is always very sweet and 
all kinds of honey have this same sweet taste. In comparison, 
all the various phenomena of the dharmakaya have one taste or 
a similar nature. 
In the third example of grain in husks, the millions of grains 
represent the great variety of teachings. The aspect of the 
teaching related to the dharmakaya is represented by the honey 
and the grains in the husk represent the aspect related to the 
various mentalities of beings. 
148. Th~tness is said to be similar to the substance of gold 
because this essence is immutable, perfectly pure and noble. 
The example of gold illustrates the changeless character of the 
suchness. Suchness is completely pure and is not affected by 
suffering or defilements. It is perfectly pure and therefore is 
compared to gold that has these same qualities. 
270 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
149. One should know the potential as having two aspects, 
similar to the treasure and the tree grown from the fruit: 
that naturally present since beginningless time 
and that perfected through proper cultivation. 
150. From this twofold potential comes achievement 
of the three Buddhakayas: the first through the former 
and the other two through the latter. 
The above two and following three examples refer to the causal 
ground. The causal ground can be compared to a treasure 
because a treasure can lie beneath the ground for hundreds of 
years and yet remain unchanged. The causal ground can be 
compared to a fruit because as long as fruit is still a fruit one 
cannot see the tree, but the fruit contains the potential to be a 
tree. The example of a treasure describes the innate aspect of 
the causal ground and the example of the fruit describes how 
the proper practice of virtue can manifest into Buddhahood. 
These two aspects of the causal ground develop into the three 
kayas of the Buddha. The dharmakaya is the mature 
manifestation of the innate aspect and the form kayas 
(sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya) are the natural manifestation 
of the practice of virtue. 
151. The embodiment of the magnificent essence 
should be known as being similar to the statue 
made of precious substances, being natural and non-created 
and a treasure ofjewel-like qualities. 
152. The perfect expression is like the chakravartin, 
being endowed with the greater dharma's majesty. 
Like the golden image are the emanations; 
having the very nature of a representation. 
Buddha-Essence- TheFourth Vtzjra Point 271 
The essence-kaya, svabhavikakaya or dharmakaya, can be 
compared to the example of a Buddha statue made of precious 
substances. The innate aspect of the causal ground can be 
compared to a treasure of jewels because it is naturally present. 
The sambhogakaya can be compared to a great king or 
chakravartin because the sambhogakaya is endowed with the 
great power of dharma. The nirmanakaya can be compared to 
a golden statue because it is a representation of the Buddha. 
153. This ultimate truth of the spontaneously born 
is to be understood by faith alone: 
the orb of the sun may shine 
but it cannot be seen by the blind. 
154. There is nothing whatever to remove from this 
nor the slightest thing thereon to add 
Truly beholding the true nature, 
when truly seen, complete liberation. 53 
As an ordinary person one cannot understand Buddha-essence 
directly and therefore needs the help of faith to understand it. 
The Buddha-essence has been present from the very beginning 
and was never created by anyone. It is the spontaneously present 
jnana. An ordinary person cannot see this directly because his 
Buddha-essence is obscured by impurities. He or she may be 
able to gain some indirect understanding of it by inference, 
but even th!~ is hard to understand because it is in the domain 
of the inconceivable. For example, the sun sheds its brilliant 
rays all the time; as far as the sun is concerned, it never is 
obscured by anything. But a blind person will never see this 
sunshine. In the same way, the spontaneously present jnana 
has been there from the very beginning but it is hidden from 
ordinary beings that do not have the clear eyes of prajna to see 
272 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
through the thick darkness of ignorance. They must rely on 
faith in order to understand this Buddha-essence. 
Buddha-essence has two kinds of purity: it is naturally pure, 
and it is free of incidental impurities. It has always possessed 
these qualities, but when one doesn't see this fully one makes 
mistakes, goes astray, and wanders in samsara. 
155. The element is devoid of transient things to be purified, 
that have a character separable from it. 
It is not devoid of the ultimate qualities 
of character indifferentiable from it. 
Buddha-essence is both void and yet not empty in a way. The 
Buddha-essence is devoid of any passing impurity because these 
impurities are not an intrinsic part of Buddha-essence. On the 
other hand, the Buddha-essence is not empty of the supreme 
qualities because these qualities are an inseparable part of the 
actual nature of the Buddha-essence. 
D. The Importance of the Buddha-Essence Teachings 
The fourth major division in this chapter on Buddha-essence 
explains why it is necessary to teach that the Buddha-essence is 
always present and what benefits one can expect from 
understanding this teaching. 
To review, the Buddha turned the wheel of dharma three 
times. The second turning demonstrated the emptiness of all 
phenomena. In these teachings the . Buddha said there is no 
form, sound, taste, smell, etc. Everything is empty of any 
substantial nature. Everything is empty and transcends the four 
extremes of existence, non-existence, both and neither, and the 
eight mental fabrications. Everything is the dharmadhatu, 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vajra Point 273 
empty of any substantial nature of its own. In the third turning, 
the Buddha stated that all beings possess Buddha-essence and 
he described the nature of this Buddha-essence in detail. 
Ordinary beings might think that there is a contradiction 
between the teachings of the second turning, in which the 
Buddha said there was nothing with a nature of its own, and 
the third turning in which he said there was. 
156. He had taught in various places that every knowable 
thing is ever void, like a cloud, dream dr illusion. 
Why therefore did the Buddha declare the essence of 
Buddhahood to be present in every sentient being? 
In the text it states that the Buddha taught that phenomena 
are empty of substantial nature; they are like a cloud, a dream, 
or an illusion. This was explained in many sutras in the long, 
middle, and short form of the Prajnaparamita sutra. The 
Buddha in this teaching stated that anything knowable is devoid 
of any actual nature; that is, it is always void and always has 
been empty. In the third turning, the Buddha said that all beings 
possess Buddha-essence. This appears to contradict the second 
turning teachings. 
157. There are five mistakes: faint-heartedness, 
contempt for those of lesser ability, belief in the false, 
slandering the true meaning and self-cherishing. 
So that those in whom the above exist may rid themselves 
of these, thus it was declared. 
The answer to this contraction is that if we do not understand 
the presence of Buddha-essence in all beings, we will make five 
mistakes in reasoning. 
274 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Ct The first mistake is faint-heartedness; we will become 
discOuraged about the possibility of attaining Buddhahood. We 
will think the Buddhas of the past have managed to attain 
Buddhahood, but they were individuals quite different from 
ourselves, and for this reason Buddhahood is totally out of reach. 
If we think this way, we may not even begin to work for 
liberation. 
Ct The second mistake is that if we don't know that other 
beings have Buddha-essence, we might feel contempt for 
persons who have a lesser understanding than our own and 
believe they have no chance of achieving Buddhahood. 
Ct The third mistake is to foster misconceptions 
concerning the true nature of things and to believe appearances 
are real. 
Ct The fourth mistake is that if we don't understand that 
all beings have· Buddha-essence, and therefore have the potential 
to reach Buddhahood, we might think that beings are simply 
empty and void and we might therefore ridicule their true 
nature. 
Ct If we do not understand that all beings are alike because 
they all possess Buddha-essence, we may make the fifth mistake 
of thinking more highly of ourselves than others. We therefore 
~pend more time looking for happiness for ourselves and less 
in helping others. 
To prevent these five mistakes the Buddha presented three 
teachings. 
158. The ultimate and true nature is always devoid 
of any compounded thing. 
Therefore it is taught that defilements, actions 
and their foll maturation are like a clouds and so forth. 
Buddha-ESsence- The Fourth Vtzjra Point 275 
The ultimate nature of all phenomena is devoid of anything 
composite. In this true nature there is no such thing as form, 
sound, sight, etc., because it transcends the four extremes and 
the eight conceptual fabrications. In the ultimate sense everything 
is emptiness, but in the relative sense everything manifests out 
of the defilements, karma, and the fruition of karma. 
159. The defilements are taught to be like clouds, 
karma is likened to the experience in dreams 
and the full ripening of karma and defilements, 
the aggregates, are likened to conjurations. 
These three causes of manifestation are compared to clouds, a 
dream, and an illusion respectively. In the second turning, all 
relative manifestation are described as an illusion but in the 
ultimate sense all phenomena are considered to be empty. The 
defilements ofvattachment, aggression, ignorance, and belief 
in a self are compared to clouds that cover the Buddha-essence. 
These defilements give rise to our positive and negative actions 
(karma) that are tainted by the presence of defilements. These 
actions can be compared to the experiences we have in dreams. 
Although sounds, forms, feelings, and so on appear to us as 
real when we dream, they have no reality in themselves. This is 
true of everything we experience. As a result of defilements 
and karma the five aggregates develop. A great magician with 
different tricks can conjure up different illusions. The magician 
produces these illusions but they do not have any actual 
independent reality. In the same way, all aggregates and 
manifestations of existence are conjured up by the defilements 
and karma and are like an illusion that has no independent 
reality. The second turning made clear that on the ultimate 
level everything is empty, but on the relative level everything 
manifests to us like clouds or dreams or illusions. 
276 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
160. Thus was it presented previously and then 
'the element exists' was taught ultimately 
as this continuum in this way 
so that these five faults could be abandoned. 
161. Not learning this, some people are disheartened, 
through mistaken self-contempt; 
bodhichitta will not develop in them. 
The purpose· of this teaching was to eliminate five 
misconceptions that arise when Buddha-essence is not properly 
understood. 
The first mistake is discouragement or faintheartedness 
which is a form of self-contempt. It appears when someone 
thinks they are unable to do something because they are not 
good enough to do it. We think, "I cannot get rid of the 
defilements; I cannot achieve Buddhahood and help beings and 
practice dharma." For this reason we lack the confidence to 
practice. In general, when someone does not have enough 
confidence in worldly affairs, they cannot accomplish their 
goals. This is also true of the dharma; if we do not have enough 
courage we are not able to generate the state of mind that is 
conducive to enlightenment. A bodhisattva must have 
compassion and understanding. Without self-confidence, the 
bodhisattva will not be able to attempt to fulfill his or her goal, 
to liberate sentient beings. 
162. Some people, through pride, think, 'I am better,' 
because bodhichitta has dawned in them. 
They dwell insistently in the notion that 
those in whom it has not dawned are inferior. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth l&jra Point 277 
If we are able to generate some bodhichitta, then others who do 
not have this motivation appear inferior. So to think, ''I'm much 
better than others because they do not have strong motivation," 
and to develop strong pride and look down on others is the second 
mistake because everyone has Buddha-essence. 
163. Right understanding cannot arise 
in those who think like this. 
Thus, since they misinterpret the true, 
they will not understand the truth. 
The third mistake is to lack the right kind of understanding 
and to believe phenomenal appearances to be real. We cling to 
this misconception, because we do not understand that all 
phenomenal appearances are empty. 
164. Beings' defects are not truly rea~ 
as they are but a fabrication and incidentaL 
In reality, these faults are not entities 
whereas the qualities are naturally pure. 
The faults and defects in beings are only transient. They are 
fabrications. Actually, within all beings all of the qualities are 
both pure and present. If we don't understand this, we will 
speak ill of the true nature, which is the fourth mistake. 
165. If o_!)e clings to the faults, the untrue, 
and disparages the qualities, the true, 
one will not have the loving kindness of the wise 
which sees the similarity between oneself and others. 
The fifth mistake is not to realize that all beings possess Buddha­
essence and to value oneself over all beings. The opposite is 
218 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
characteristic of bodhisattvas who love others as much as 
themselves. If we do not know about Buddha-essence, we 
cannot achieve this complete love. 
166. Through learning in such a fashion, there arises 
enthusiastic diligence, respect (as for a Buddha), 
prajna, jnana, and great love. 
If we know that Buddha-essence is present in all beings, the 
five mistakes can be avoided. When we hear the teachings on 
Buddha-essence we will not be discouraged; on the contrary 
we will be happy to learn there is no need to continue in samsara 
because we possess this essence of Buddhahood and have the 
power to achieve Buddhahood in the future. We will be full of 
joy when we discover we are on the path with all the Buddhas 
of the past, ·present and future and are able to achieve 
enlightenment because we possess the cause of enlightenment. 
The second benefit of this teaching is that we will develop 
respect for all beings. Because all beings are potential Buddhas, 
we cannot despise them, but can only feel respect for them. 
The knowledge of Buddha-essence will also dispel the three 
remaining faults. Knowing that all persons possess Buddha­
~s~ence enables us to understand that all phenomena are empty 
of substance. When at first we understand that everything is 
empty and believe in this reality, knowledge of Buddha-essence 
gives rise to prajna that is the understanding of the true nature 
of phenomena. The understanding that Buddha-essence is 
possessed by all beings gives birth to jnana. Finally, loving­
kindness develops when we cease to consider ourselves more 
important than everyone else. 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vtzjra Point 279 
mistake 
1. faintheartedness 
2. pride 
3. lacking right understanding 
4. denial of what is true 
5. self-cherishing quality 
enthusiastic diligence 
respect for others 
prajna 
Jnana 
loving kindness 
167. Due to the growth of these five qualities, 
unhealthy aspects will be absent and similarity will be seen. 
Through faultlessness, innate qualities and loving kindness 
which recognizes the similarity of self and other, 
Buddhahood will be swiftly achieved. 
With the growth of these five good qualities, the five 
unwholesome qualities will be abandoned and we will 
understand that all beings are the same in that they all possess 
the Buddha-essence and have the power to achieve 
Buddhahood. When we know this, we will develop loving 
kindness towards all beings. This will make it possible to achieve 
Buddhahood quickly. 
This was the first chapter, on the "Essence of the Tathagatas" 
from the Analysis of the Potential of the Rare and Supreme in 
this Ultimate Mahayana Treatise on the Changeless 
Continuity of the True Nature. 
280 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
A Summary of the Ten Qualities of 
Buddha-Essence

The nature of Buddha-essence is inherently pure like: 
a. a jewel (has power) 
b. the sky (is changeless) 
c. water (compassion) 
2. Cause 
There are four causes that allow Buddha-essence to manifest: 
a. aspiration (to overcome hostility to 
dharma) 
b. prajna (to overcome belief in a 
c. samadhi 
d. compassion self) 
(to overcome the fear of 
samsara) 
(to overcome selfishness) 
3. Result 
Once the fruition Buddha-essence manifests which is beyond 
samsara and nirvana, the following qualities appear: 
·a. transcendent purity (counteracts impurity) 
b. transcendent identity (counteracts mistaken 
c. transcendent happiness 
d. transcendent permanence belief in self) 
(counteracts suffering) 
(counteracts 
impermanence) 
4. Function 
The function or influence of Buddha-essence is: 
a. develop weariness of samsara 
b. understand the benefits of nirvana 
Buddha-Essence- The Fourth Vttjra Point 281 
5. Endowments 
The endowments of Buddha-essence are: 
In the example of the ocean which explains the path: 
a. dharmakaya (the vastness of the 
ocean) 
b. two-fold jnana (the jewels in the ocean) 
c. compassion (the wetness of ocean) 
In the example of the lamp-flame which explains fruition: 
a. clear cognition (the light of the lamp) 
b. stainless jnana (the heat of the lamp) 
c. luminous clarity (the color of the lamp) 
6. Approach

8. All-pervasiveness 
The all-pervasiveness of Buddha-essence is explained in the 
example of space as follows: 
a. it pervades all but unaffected by it 
b. it pervades everything without distinction 
282 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
9. Unalterability 
Buddha-essence is unalterable because: 
In the example of ordinary beings it possesses: 
a. earth (the aggregates, elements, 
and senses) 
b. water (karma and the 
defilements) 
c. au (incorrect understanding) 
d. space (luminous clarity)

duality) 
d. being beyond death (the quality of being 
eternal) 
In the example of the Buddhas it possesses: 
a. being permanent (the Buddhas are 
changeless) 
b. being everlasting (constant refuge for 
beings) 
c. being non-dual (sameness of samsara and 
nirvana) 
d. being immutable (Buddhahood is not 
fabricated) 
10. Inseparability of the Qualities 
The qualities of Buddha-essence are inseparable because:

c. the highest truth 
d. the supreme nirvana (is the knowledge of 
things as they are) 
(is beyond suffering) 

ENLIGHTENMENT 
Tbe Fikb Vajra Point 285 
THE EXPLANATION of the fifth vajra point is similar in 
structure to the outline of the chapter oh Buddha-essence. 
There will be a summary of eight points concerning 
enlightenment and then each of these points will be presented 
in greater detail. 
Characteristics of Enlightenment 
168. Purity, achievement, freedom, 
benefit for oneself and others, 
basis, depth, vastness, greatness of nature, 
their enduri_ng nature and suchness itself 
169. present the state of Buddhahood according to 
its nature, cause, fruit, fonction, endowments, 
manifestation, permanence and inconceivability. 
286 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
One must first enter the path that leads to enlightenment. 
When this path reaches completion, one achieves Buddhahood. 
• In the first point it is explained that the nature of 
enlightenment is purity because no obscurations remain. 
• In the second point it is explained that on the path one 
studies, reflects, and practices meditation. When these practices 
have sufficiently developed, one achieves Buddhahood. 
• In the third point it is explained that once one is 
completely free from obscurations, one is free from anything 
that must be relinquished. 
• The fourth point is called function. This point describes 
the function of enlightenment, which is to create the best 
possible outcome for oneself and others. Reaching 
enlightenment is the best possible outcome because one will 
never have to return to samsara and experience suffering again. 
This is of great value to others because it will help an incalculable 
number of other beings reach the same state. 
• The fifth point describes the various qualities that are 
the basis for the twofold realization which leads to 
enlightenment. 
• The sixth point describes the way in which 
enlightenment manifests through the qualities of depth, 
vastness, and greatness of nature, the qualities which are related 
to the three kayas. Depth is related to the dharmakaya which is 
the true nature of all phenomena. Vastness is the definitive 
quality of the sambhogakaya because sambhogakaya can 
manifest in a ·great variety of ways. Greatness of nature describes 
the nirmanakaya because the nirmanakaya is by nature very 
pure and its function is to provide help to sentient beings. 
• The seventh point describes enlightenment in terms of 
the duration of this activity. * The last point refers to the actual nature of phenomena 
which is related to the quality of inconceivability. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 287 
Each of these aspects is defined by means of the various 
qualities that describe them. Purity describes the nature of 
enlightenment; achievement is-the characteristic that describes 
the fruition of the path; freedom from all impurities is the 
final result of the path. Value for oneself and others describes 
the function of enlightenment. The basis for this twofold value 
is all the qualities present when enlightenment is attained. 
The depth, vastness, and greatness of nature refer to the 
dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya respectively 
and to the way in which these kayas manifest. Permanence 
describes duration of these kayas. The actual nature is defined 
as being inconceivable. 
1 & 2. Nature and Cause of Enlightenment 
170. That which has been described as 'its nature is 
luminous clarity' is like the sun and space, 
obscured by the thick veils 
of those multitude of 'clouds' which are merely incidental; 
the defilements and the cognitive obscuration. 
Buddhahood has no stain, 
is endowed with Buddha-qualities, 
and is permanent, everlasting and without change. 
Its achievement depends upon non-conceptual jnana 
and analytical jnana regarding all phenomena. 
The nature of' enlightenment represents purity and the cause 
of enlightenment is the conditions necessary to achieve 
enlightenment. Buddha-essence is by nature clear light (Tib. 
osel),54 which means that by nature it is completely pure. Even 
for ordinary beings Buddha-essence is pure in nature. When it 
288 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
manifests at enlightenment, it is free from incidental stains by 
the .four particularities. 
The first three particularities refer to the nature of 
enlightenment and the fourth to a causal condition for 
enlightenment. 
0 The first particularity or definitive characteristic is 
luminous clarity and is compared to the sun. The sun refers to 
the essence, and space refers to the nature. This example of sun 
and space refers to the two facets of enlightenment. The sun 
refers to knowledge and space refers to purity from all 
obscurations. This is parallel to the Tibetan word for the Buddha 
which is "sang gye." "Sang" means "completely pure" referring 
to the fact that Buddha-essence manifests as purity, while "gye" 
means "awakened" from the sleep of ignorance referring to the 
way that Buddha-essence manifests as realization. 
0 The second definitive characteristic is purity which 
literally means "having relinquished all impurities." The 
emotional and cognitive obscurations can be compared to 
clouds covering the sun. 
0 The third definitive characteristic is the possession of 
Buddha qualities. The Buddha possesses all of the qualities of 
freedom and the qualities of maturity which are not temporary, 
but everlasting and unchanging. 
0 When one reaches Buddhahood, a causal condition 
emerges that is an integral part of both the non-conceptual 
and analytical jnana. It makes achievement of Buddhahood 
possible. When enlightenment is achieved, one possesses the 
knowledge of exactly how phenomena are (non-conceptual 
jnana) and variety of phenomena (analytical jnana). At the level 
of a bodhisattva these two jnanas are already present and 
functioning but they become fully developed in Buddhahood. 
The non-conceptual jnana functions during meditation when 
one obtains direct insight into the true nature of phenomena. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth 14tjra Point 289 
Analytical jnana is brought to bear during post-meditation when 
one learns about the great variety of relative phenomena. By 
means of these two aspects of jnana Buddhahood is achieved. 
In more detail: 
171. Buddhahood is indivisible yet one can categorize it 
according to its qualities of purity -
the two qualities ofjnana and freedom, 
comparable to the sun and to space. 
172. This luminous clarity is. uncreated. 
It is that which pervades without any differentiation, 
possessing all Buddhahood's qualities, for greater in number 
than the sand grains in the river Ganges. 
173. The defilements and cognitive obscurations are said to 
be like covering clouds, since they are, by nature, 
non-existent, they spread everywhere and are but incidental. 
17 4. The two jnana, 
considered as non-conceptual and ensuing, 
cause freedom from these two veils. 
• The first definitive characteristic describes the nature 
of enlightenment. Previously, this aspect of enlightenment was 
compared to the sun and space. The sun represents the luminous 
clarity ofjnina and space represents the purity that comes when 
all incidental impurities are relinquished. Buddhahood is 
indivisible which means that it cannot be separated from the 
Buddha-essence. It is also perfectly pure, having the purity of 
nature and the purity of complete elimination of impurities. 
In this way jnana is like the sun and freedom from impurities 
is like space. 
290 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
0 Secondly, these qualities are said to be inseparable from 
each other. Since it is said that the clear light is uncreated and 
the Buddha-essence is by nature luminous clarity, this luminous 
clarity is necessarily inherent. It pervades all beings without 
any differentiation and the good qualities of Buddhahood are 
greater than the number of grains of sand in the river Ganges. 
0 Third, although impurities are actually non-existent 
(void), they are present in ordinary beings like clouds covering 
the sun. Clouds appearing in the sky do not belong to the nature 
of the sky, but are only incidental to it. Similarly, the tarnish 
on a piece of gold is not part of the gold; but something that 
can be removed because it is not an intrinsic part of its nature. 
Because these impurities are not an integral part ofBuddha­
essence, they can be removed. These impurities are defined as 
non-existent, pervading every direction but are only incidental 
phenomena. Similarly, clouds represent the two obscurations 
veiling Buddha-essence; when they are removed Buddhahood 
manifests in its full purity. 
0 The fourth point is that these obscurations can be 
removed by means of the two jnanas. The manifestation of 
Buddha-essence is similar to the emergence of the sun when 
the clouds have been blown away. The emotional obscurations 
~re the aspect ofBuddhahood that is associated with liberation 
and the cognitive obscurations occluding omniscience. 55 These 
two jnanas of the knowledge of the true nature and the nature 
of variety of phenomena manifest gradually until they fully 
mature at enlightenment. Knowledge of exactly what is develops 
out of non-conceptual meditation focused on the empty nature 
of phenomena. 
Post-meditation allows the jnana of variety to manifest 
showing what is relevant at the relative level (called the "vast" 
aspect of phenomena).. It also reveals what belongs to the 
ultimate level called the "deep" aspect of phenomena. This 
Enlightenment- The Fifth vajra Point 291 
last aspect dispels the cognitive obscurations. As the path 
develops these two qualities they also become more fully 
developed so that the obscurations can be removed and 
Buddhahood can manifest. 
3. Fruition of Enlightenment 
There are two logical ways the fruition of enlightenment can 
occur. It could be created by something else or it could be 
revealed as obscurations are removed. In the Uttaratantra it is 
said that purification occurs by removing obscurations. If the 
qualities of the Buddha were acquired, they would be composite 
in nature and subject to change. However, since they are innately 
present in the mind of all beings they need not be acquired 
and cannot be acquired. 
175. Like a lake of purest water gradually overspread 
by lotuses, 
like the full moon set free from Rahu's mouth 
and like the sun liberated from the banked 
defilement clouds, 
this is radiantly manifest; stainless and bearing all qualities. 
Freedom from .the disturbing emotion of desire is compared to 
the simile of a lake covered by lotuses. Freedom from anger 
uses the simile of the. moon freed from being eaten by Rahu 
(Rahu is a symbol for an eclipse). Freedom from ignorance 
uses the simile of the sun and clouds. 
176. Such Buddhahood is like the Victor, the best of all, 
like the honey, the kernels, the gold, so valuable, 
the treasure, the great tree, the image of the Sugata, 
292 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
made that which is precious and pure, 
like the king of the worlds and like the statue of gold. 
The nine examples of the previous chapter are, first of all, given 
to illustrate that Buddhahood is like the body of the Buddha, 
honey can be used after being taken away from the bees, kernels 
of the grains can be eaten once the husk has been removed, etc. 
In more detail: 
177. Purity, as absence of incidental defilements, 
desire and so on, 
is like the waters of the lake and so forth. 
In brief it is described as being the fruit of 
non-conceptual jnana. 
The purity achieved by non-conceptual and post-meditational 
jnana is the fruition of the purification of the emotional 
obscurations. This is illustrated using the following three 
examples: a lake overgrown with lotuses, an eclipse, and clouds 
hiding the sun. When these obscuring factors are removed, one 
can see the pure waters of the lake, the full moon, and the sun. 
In the same way, when the defilements are removed, one can 
see the Buddha-essence clearly without any emotional 
obscurations. Non-conceptual jnana, which is the direct 
realization of the true nature of phenomena, makes it possible 
to remove these emotional obscurations. This jnana is not 
governed by conceptual formulations; it simply perceives 
phenomena exactly as they are. 
178. Authentic attainment of the Buddha-kaya, 
endowed with the finest of all qualities, 
is taught as being the fruit of ensuing jnana. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth ~jra Point 293 
When the cognitive obscurations are removed, one can achieve 
the supremely endowed Buddha-kayas. They are removed by 
means of the post-meditation jnana that perceives all 
phenomena in all their variety without confusion. During 
meditation, one perceives the true non-existent character of 
all phenomena directly. During the post-meditation period 
that follows one sees the great variety of illusions in which 
beings are immersed. This particular post-meditation jnana 
erases the cognitive obscurations. In this way all of the 
Buddha-kayas can manifest. 
179. This is like the lake of pure waters and so on 
because the silt of desire has been removed 
and because it causes the waters of meditative stability 
to sustain the 'lotus' beings who are to be trained. 
In this point it is explained exactly how· the fruition of 
Buddhahood is freed from the three poisons. In the example of 
the lake, persons are compared to lotuses and these "lotuses" 
are purified of the silt of desire by the pure waters of meditation. 
180. It is like the unblemished full moon since, 
freed from hatreds 'Rahu, 'it embraces all beings 
with its light of great compassion and loving kindness. 
The second example is of the moon that has been obscured by 
an eclipse. Normally, the moon's light is very bright, cooling, 
and soothing. During an eclipse it becomes reddish, then black, 
and is no longer beautiful and bright. Similarly, there is a very 
strong change that takes place when individuals are under the 
influence of anger. When under the influence of anger a very 
peaceful and loving person becomes unkind and develops the 
wish to hurt others. This anger eclipses a person's natural good 
294 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
qualities. When someone is liberated from anger, it is like the 
full moon emerging from an eclipse. 
181. Buddhahood is like the immaculate sun because, 
completely free of ignorance's clouds, it dispels beings' 
darkness with the radiance of its primordial wisdom. 
The third example compares freedom from ignorance to clouds 
that cover the sun. Ignorance does not exactly take the same 
form as other types of emotional instability. It is not the same 
sort of violent fee\ing one experiences with anger or desire. It 
is more like an undertone, like something that is continually 
present. Living in ignorance also does not bring about much 
obvious suffering. Similarly, when clouds obscure the sun, the 
sun cannot perform its function, that of making flowers grow 
and crops ripen. In the same way, when one is obscured by 
ignorance, the light of prajna and jnana cannot shine and these 
qualities cannot develop to their fullness. When however, 
someone, is liberated from ignorance, the light of jnana can 
dispel the darkness that·surrounds them and can radiate out to 
all beings. This is why the great sun ofBuddhahood can dispel 
the darkness of the ignorance of all beings. 
The emotionally tainted obscurations are listed in the 
Abhidharma as the ten basic and twenty secondary defilements. 
These are even further divided into the obscurations that can 
be removed by insight and those that can removed by cultivation 
of insight. But they can also be categorized into the three 
poisons corresponding to the three examples just given. 
Sometimes these are also explained in terms of five poisons: 
attachment, aggres,sion, and ignorance plus pride and jealousy. 
Jealousy, however, possesses the same nature as aggression; and 
pride is rooted in ignorance because it results in the belief that 
one is more gifted or intelligent than others. Once these 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vtzjra Point 295 
disturbing emotions have been removed the qualities of 
Buddhahood can manifest. 
182. Because it has peerless qualities, gives the taste of true 
dharma and is free from the shell of ignorance, 
it is likened to the Sugata, to honey and to the kernel. 
The detailed explanation of the freedom from the cognitive 
obscurations is presented using nine examples. 
0 First, Buddhahood freed from the impurities is 
compared to the body of Buddha, because there is nothing else 
that is of a similar worth. 
0 Second, it is compared to honey because once 
Buddhahood has been achieved, it is capable of providing the 
taste of perfect dharma to all beings by providing them with 
happiness. 
0 Third, it is compared to a grain freed from the husk 
because once all the qualities are freed from the husk of 
ignorance, they can be tasted in all their goodness. 
183. Because it is naturally pure, 
because it dispels beings' poverty by its own wealth of 
qualities and because it gives the fruit of total liberation, 
it is likened unto gold, a treasure and the great tree. 
In the next three examples, Buddhahood is compared to gold, 
a great trd.sure, and a tree. 
0 Fourth, it is compared to gold because it is naturally 
pure. Buddhahood has a very pure nature because all of the 
fleeting impurities have been removed and it is adorned by 
myriads of qualities. 
0 Fifth, because it dispels the poverty of all beings it is 
compared to a great treasure. Because it has a wealth of qualities, 
296 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
it can remove the poverty of all who are stuck in conditioned 
existence and who suffer from lack of intelligence, lack of faith, 
and lack of happiness. It can dispel the poverty of other beings 
by turning the wheel of dharma. 
0 Sixth, it will lead to perfect fruition so it is compared 
to a tree that grows from a fruit. Turning the wheel of dharma 
is not just a short-term help; it is a way to achieve ultimate 
happiness through complete liberation. 
184. Because it is the embodiment ofjewel qualities, ' 
because it is the 'supreme lord of bipeds' 
and because its form is an image precious in its composition, 
it is likened to the bejeweled object, the king and what 
is golden. 
These last three examples show how Buddhahood, freed from 
the cognitive obscurations, has the nature of the three kayas. 
0 The dharmakaya is compared to a jewel because it is 
not composed of any other elements. Since its nature is not 
illusory, it is compared to a statue made of precious substances. 
0 The sambhogakaya is compared to the king of all beings 
(Skt. chakravartin) in the womb of a poor and ugly mother. 
The sambhogakaya here is said to be the lord of all beings on 
earth. The sambhogakaya can help, protect and look after all 
beings. 
0 Finally, the nirmanakaya is compared to a precious 
statue inside its clay cast. It is compared to a very precious 
statue because it is like a wish-fulfilling gem.56 When the 
Buddha appears in the world, the happiness of beings increases. 
That is why it is compared here to a statue made of very precious 
substances, like the wish-fulfilling gem. 
These nine examples are those of Buddhahood that has 
been freed of all the cognitive obscurations. Each set of three 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vtzjra Point 297 
examples also has a specific meaning. The first three examples 
-of the Buddha liberated from the lotus, the honey taken from 
bees, and a kernel removed from its husk, illustrate the fruition 
of Buddhahood once the cognitive obscurations have been 
removed. Removing the emotional obscurations allows one to 
reach the state of arhats, shravakas, or pratyekabuddhas, but it 
alone does not enable one to reach final Buddhahood. Cognitive 
obscurations must also be removed if one is to attain 
Buddhahood. At enlightenment all the qualities of body, speech 
and mind of the Buddha manifest. The body aspect manifests 
in a fashion that is similar to the way the Buddha is liberated 
from the lotus. His speech manifests like the taste of the honey 
of dharma to beings when he begins teaching. His mind aspect 
manifests when the very essence, the kernel, is liberated from 
the husk. 
The second three examples show the naturalness of 
Buddhahood: gold is naturally pure, a treasure is naturally 
plentiful, and a tree is the full manifestation of the fruit. 
The last three examples of a jewel, a king, and a precious 
statue illustrate the ultimate realization which manifests in the 
form of the three kayas of the Buddha. 
4. Function of Enlightenment 
185. Enlightenment, untainted and all-pervading, 
is of an indestructible nature 
because it is everlasting, at peace, permanent and undying. 
It is the ground for benefiting beings. 
The tathagata are like space, the basis 
for the objects of the six sense faculties 
to be experienced by those who are excellent. 
298 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
There are four qualities associated with the way in which 
Buddhahood functions. The first three refer to value for one's 
self and the fourth to value for others. 
0 First, it is not tainted by any defilements or remaining 
mental imprints. 
0 Second, it is all-embracing. This function is connected 
to the way in which Buddhahood manifests as knowledge. 
0 Third, it is indestructible. This feature is connected with 
the uncreated nature of Buddhahood. Indestructibility is 
explained in four ways. It is indestructible because it does not 
suffer from old age, sickness, birth or death. Being free from 
old age, it is eternal; being free from sickness, it is at peace; 
being free from birth, it is permanent; being free from death, it 
is immortal. 
Ct Fourth, it is the ground of everything. This attribute 
ofBuddhahood is illustrated by the example of space to which 
the Buddhas are compared because its nature is uncreated. Space 
is just there, it does nothing, but it provides the possibility 
within which everything else can manifest. In the same way, 
the Buddhas provide the space within which all the faculties of 
the realized ones can be experienced. 
186. It is the condition for form beyond the four elements 
to be seen, 
for the good and pure sound to be heard, 
for the pure fragrance of the Sugatas' perfect conduct to 
be smelled, 
for the taste of the dharma of the great 
and of the deeply-realized to be savored, 
187. for the bliss folt in samadhi to be experienced 
and for the very essence, the profound nature, to be realized. 
Therefore, when considered in a very fine way, 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vttjra Point 299 
the Tathagata, who give birth to true bliss, 
are like space, devoid of reasons. 
The objects of the faculties of the realized ones are experienced 
as pure forms that transcend the four elements. This refers to 
the pure form kayas of the Buddha that can be seen by those 
who are spiritually mature. The ears of the realized ones can 
hear the pure sounds of the Mahayana dharma. Their olfactory 
senses can smell the very pure fragrance of the Buddha's perfect 
conduct. Their tongue can taste the flavor of the true dharma, 
really tasting its meaning. Also, because they have acquired great 
mastery of samadhi meditation, they can control their 
meditation and it brings them great bliss. This experience of 
bliss represents the pure experience of touch. They also have a 
mental experience of the true nature of all phenomena. This is 
how the realized ones experience all sensations as pure. 
In the ultimate sense, the Tathagatas are like space-space 
is empty and at the same time it provides the possibility for 
everything to take place in it. The Buddhas are compared to 
space because space is uncreated and unchanging. In the same 
way, the Buddhas are uncreated and spontaneously present. 
They manifest without effort and their activity takes place to 
help other beings without any attachment to results. The 
Buddhas do not think in terms of having to help and doing 
something to help. The whole thing takes place spontaneously. 
188. The fonction of the two jnana, put concisely, is to be 
known as the perfect fulfillment of the vimuktikaya and 
the accomplishment of dharmakaya. 
189. Since they are untainted, all-embracing 
and the uncreated ground, 
300 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the vimuktikaya and the dharmakaya should be known 
as having .two attributes and one attribute. 
The detailed e.xplanation of these four points will be presented 
in three divisions. The first division is an explanation of how 
twofold value is achieved by tneans of the jnana of the true 
nature and variety of phenomena. As bodhisattvas practice on 
the path, these two jnanas appear gradually in a logical 
prog~ession. In meditation non-conceptual jnana manifests as 
the attempt to understand the ultimate nature of phenomena. 
In post-meditation, analytical jnana examines the variety of 
phenomena in order to understand their specific characteristics. 
When these two jnanas are fully developed, they express 
themselves in the form of two kayas of the Buddha, which are 
actually aspects of the dharmakaya. One is known as the 
vimuktikaya, which means the "embodiment ofliberation." 57 
The other is the dharmakaya or "embodiment of dharma." 58 
The vimuktikaya is attained through non-conceptual jnana 
developed during meditation that eliminates all obscurations. 
The dharmakaya is obtained as a result of the jnana of post­
meditation. This jnana consists in the understanding of 
phenomena provided by analysis that finds its expression at 
the fruition in the dharmakaya. 
Enlightenment is divided into the vimuktikaya and the 
dharmakaya with the vimuktikaya representing the untainted 
qualities ofBuddhahood and the dharmakaya representing the 
qualities of all-pervasiveness of Buddhahood because the 
dharmakaya pervades all phenomena. These kayas are also both 
uncreated and indestructible. 
The three qualities, those of purity, all-pervasiveness, and 
indestructibility, represent perfect fulfillment for oneself and 
have the power to achieve perfect fulfillment for others. This is 
the fourth quality, that which insures the happiness of other 
Enlightenment- Th,e Fifth \&jra Point 301 
beings. Therefore the vimuktikaya and dharmakaya represent 
fulfillment for oneself and perfect fulfillment for others, insofar 
as they are the ground for all other qualities of Buddhahood. 
190. It is untainted because the defilements, 
along with their accompanying conditioning, have ceased. 
Jnana is considered as all-embracing 
since it is unattached and unimpedf:d. 
191. They are uncreated since their nature 
is at all times indestructible, 
mentioned and explained as everlastingness and so on. 
When the defilements have been totally relinquished, 
Buddhahood becomes perfect fulfillment and all of the very 
fine mental imprints have been totally erased. This fruition is 
very different from the fruition of the path of the shravakas or 
pratyekabuddhas because their mental imprints have not been 
removed. In Buddhahood all of these disappear completely and 
the quality of purity manifests as the absence of any taint. 
The second aspect of perfect realization represented by the 
dharmakaya is the all-pervasive quality of jnana at this level. 
Once all obscurations have been removed, the Buddha jnana 
can pervade everything and is not hindered by misperceptions. 
The qualities of perfect purity and perfect realization 
represent respectively lack of taint and full pervasi~n. Together 
these two qualities possess the common quality of 
indestructibility. This in-destructibility, as already mentioned, 
is eternal, at peace, permanent and deathless. 
192. Destructibility is to be known through the following 
four aspects, 
since they are the counterparts of everlastingness and so forth: 
302 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
decay, drastic change, interruption and 
the inconceivable change of death. 
193. Since enlightenment is free of change, it should be 
known as everlasting, at peace, permanent and deathless. 
Enlightenment manifests as indestructibility, a quality that is 
not shared by phenomena. Everything that is created or 
composite in nature undergoes aging, sickness, birth and death. 
Destructibility manifests as decay corresponding to old age, 
drastic change corresponds to sickness, interruption corresponds 
to birth. Destruction in the form of inconceivable change 
corresponds to death. 
193. (Cont'd) This intelligence, so stainless is 'the ground' 
because it is the foundation for all virtuous qualities. 
The quality of stainless intelligence is the ground. from which 
the benefit of all beings emerges because it is the basis of all 
of the virtuous qualities. Stainless intelligence is the essence 
from which all the impurities have been removed and in which 
ones knowledge is fully developed. For this reason stainless 
intelligence is the ground of all of the enlightened qualities 
of all beings. The function of a person's capabilities and gifts 
is to provide him or her with the opportunity to carry out 
virtuous activity. Therefore Buddha-essence is the basis of all 
virtuous qualities. 
194. just as space, which is without cause, is the cause 
for the seeing, hearing, and so forth of 
forms, sounds, odors, sensations and mental data, 
Enlightenment- The Fifth ~jra Point 303 
195. Likewise, this is the condition for the untainted 
qualities to arise as objects of stable beings' sense faculties, 
through their unimpeded connection with the two kaya. 
For example, space is not the cause of form, sound, smell, taste, 
touch, or mental objects. It does not create them, but it provides 
the environment within which all these powers can manifest 
so that forms can be seen, sounds can be heard, etc. In the 
same way, when disciples practice the path of insight, they are 
able to see the two kayas of the Buddha, (the vimuktikaya and 
the dharmakaya) without any obstruction. 
5. Endowments 
196. Buddhahood is inconceivable, permanent, everlasting, 
at peace, immutable, perfectly at peace, all-embracing 
and concept-free. 
Like space, it is uninvolved, completely unhindered, 
free of coarse sensation, invisible, imperceptible, 
wholesome and immaculate. 
There are fi&een qualities of Buddhahood: 
1. Buddhahood is inconceivable because it can only be 
understood by self-cognizing jnana, 
2. It is permanent because it has never been born, 
3. It i~-'everlasting because it does not age, 
4. It is at peace because it is free from all of the changes 
caused by sickness, 
5. It is immutable or changeless because it never dies, 
6. It is perfectly at peace because it is completely free from 
the karmic result of suffering, 
304 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
7. It is all-embracing because it comprehends the nature of 
the variety of phenomena, 
8. It is concept-free because it includes the wisdom of the 
true nature of phenomena, 
9. It is uninvolved because it is free of the emotional 
obscurations, 
10. It is completely unhindered because it is free of cognitive 
obscuration, 
11. It is free of coarse sensations because its nature is the true 
sphere of meditation, 
12. lt is invisible because it has no form, 
13. It is imperceptible because it has no characteristics, 
14. It is wholesome because by nature it is totally pure, and 
15. It is immaculate because it is free of all incidental stains. 
19 7. Ones own folfillment and benefit for beings are made 
manifest through the vimuktikaya and the dharmakaya. 
These two foundations, of own-benefit and benefit for 
others, have the above qualities of inconceivability 
and so forth. 
The above fifteen qualities of Buddhahood, manifest as the 
vimuktikaya and the dharmakaya. The Tibetan word for 
"Buddha" is "sang gye" with "sang' meaning "awakened from 
the sleep of ignorance," and "gye" meaning "fully blossomed." 
This indicates the two facets of Buddhahood -purity and 
realization. The two aspects of Buddhahood are also included 
in the Tibetan term for "enlightenment" _which is made up of 
the two syllables "chang" meaning "purified" and "chub" 
meaning "assimilated," or "taken in" or "internalized." The first 
syllable indicates that Buddhahood is completely free of stains. 
The vimuktikaya is defined by this purity. The second syllable 
refers to the realization through which Buddhahood is manifest. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 305 
The dharmakaya is the fruition of this realization. The 
vimuktikaya and dharmakaya are valuable for oneself and others 
respectively. In more detail: 
198. Buddhahood is the domain of omniscient jnana 
and not within the scope of the three forms of prajna. 
Therefore the jnanakaya should be understood 
as being inconceivable for beings. 
1. The primary quality of enlightenment is inconceivability. 
It is explained first because it is the main quality that permeates 
all of the other qualities of a Buddha. The true qualities of a 
Buddha cannot be really understood by anyone other than a 
Buddha. Other beings may have an idea of what Buddhahood 
is, but only a Buddha understands Buddhahood directly. 
199. Being so subtle, it is not an object of study. 
Being the ultimate truth, it is not contemplation's domain. 
Being the profound universal essence, it falls outside the 
scope of the mundane sorts of meditation and their like. 
Enlightenment cannot be understood by means of the three 
prajnas of study, contemplation and meditation. This is true 
for ordinary beings as well as for all of the bodhisattvas, 
including those who reside on the tenth bodhisattva level. 
Enlightenment transcends these three forms of knowledge 
because Buddhahood is far too subtle to be within the scope of 
study. When one studies, one can only obtain a very general 
and indirect knowledge of enlightenment. This is analogous to 
when one sees a form or hears a sound; one apprehends the 
objects of perception in a rather gross way since one cannot 
perceive them directly. Enlightenment cannot be the object of 
reflection either. When one reflects on some phenomena using 
306 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
discursive thought, the object can only be apprehended in a 
crude form. One cannot understand the actual nature of the 
object. For this reason contemplation cannot encompass 
something as subtle as enlightenment because enlightenment 
manifests at the level of realm of the ultimate. Finally, 
enlightenment cannot function as the pbject of meditation of 
ordinary beings. However, the prajna in the ~editation of a 
bodhisattva can comprehend enlightenment. This knowledge 
could be called prajna, but it is more like jnana. It is the jnana 
that manifests progressively as the development of a bodhisattva 
unfolds. It's not so much the result of their meditation as the 
general process within which jnana develops. 
200. This is because the immature have never seen 
this before, 
just like th'Ose born blind confronted with visible form. 
Even the deeply realized are like the newly born 
seeing sunlight .from within their room. 
The inability of ordinary beings to study enlightenment can 
be compared to a blind person. Even though visual forms exist 
outside, a blind person does not have any idea of what they 
look like or what they are. In the same way, ordinary beings 
cannot have an experience of enlightenment. They cannot see, 
know, or experience the vimuktikaya and the dharmakaya. 
Enlightenment is also, in part, inconceivable to deeply 
realized bodhisattvas who have only a small experience of it. 
They can be compared to a newborn baby in a house. If the 
sun is shining outside and the baby is inside the house, this 
child will be touched by some of its rays and feel a little bit of 
its warmth. In the same way, the realized bodhisattvas have 
some experience of the Buddha qualities as they progress along 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vttjra Point 307 
the bodhisattva levels, but these glimpses are a far cry from the 
full experience of Buddhahood. 
201. It is permanent, as it has no origination, 
everlasting, as it has no cessation, 
at peace, being free from both 
immutable, since it abides in the true nature, 
202. perfoctly at peace, since it is the truth of cessation, 
all-embracing, since all has been understood, 
concept-free, since it does not dwell, 
non-clinging, since all defilements have been dispelled, 
203. always unhindered, since obscurations to 
knowledge are purified, 
free from coarse sensations, being without two and 
highly-suited, 
204. invisible, since it is formless, 
imperceptible, because it has no characteristic, 
wholesome since its nature is pure and 
immaculate, as all impurities have been removed. 
The second quality is changelessness, which actually 
encompasses the second to fifth qualities, those of permanence, 
everlasting, at peace and immutability. 
2. Enlightenment is changeless because it is present in all 
beings from the start. It is not created by various causes and 
conditions. For this reason it is permanent. 
3. If it has never been born it obviously cannot cease and 
therefore is everlasting. 
308 The Uttaratantr.a- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
4. If there's no beginning or no ·end, then there are no 
upsetting patterns in between. For this reason enlightenment 
is at peace. 
5. There is nothing to disturb the nature of enlightenment. 
It is not affected by any kind of change. It is immutable because 
enlightenment is always at rest and its trl1e nature never changes. 
The sixth through the eleventh qualities express the perfect 
fulfillment of purification and realization. 
6. The sixth quality is that of being perfectly at peace 
because all suffering has been completely uprooted. This 
corresponds to the truth of cessation- when all impurities have 
been removed, there is no longer any opportunity for suffering 
to arise. If impurities were still present, these would still be 
caused by emotional disruptions. Buddhahood then is perfectly 
at peace and free from emotional obscurations. 
7. The seventh quality is that it is all-embracing; a quality 
that is related to the luminous clarity that emerges when the 
cognitive obscurations dissolve. When these obscurations are 
removed, a very clear knowledge of all phenomena develops. 
Everything is as clear as though it were in the palm of ones 
hand. 
8. The eighth quality of Buddhahood is that it is concept­
free because enlightenment doesn't dwell in any conceptual 
activity. 
9. The ninth quality is that it is impartial. This could also 
be translated as "not stuck to anything." Enlightenment is not 
attached to anything insofar as no emotional obscuration is 
present which would create clinging to one thing or another. 
10. The tenth quality that describes enlightenment is that 
is unimpeded. At this level knowledge is totally unhindered 
because there are no longer any cognitive obscurations. 
11. The eleventh quality is freedom from coarse sensations. 
This consists .of the ability to meditate without being disturbed 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 309 
by drowsiness or agitation. Drowsiness in meditation provokes 
a dull state of mind, an absence of luminous clarity. Agitation 
causes a constant movement of thoughts that prevents stable 
meditation. At the level of fruition, there are no longer any 
disrupting forces which could disturb meditation. Because there 
is no hindrance the meditation is free from coarse sensations. 
The last four qualities of enlightenment are described in 
terms of the four qualities of purity. 
12. The first of these four is invisibility. Buddhahood is 
formless and therefore invisible. 
13. The thirteenth quality is that it is imperceptible because 
Buddhahood has no solid characteristics. 
14. The fourteenth quality is purity, which could also be 
rendered as "wholesomeness," meaning that nothing in it is 
tmpure. 
15. The last quality that describes enlightenment is that it 
is immaculate because all of the impurities that would impede 
proper meditation have been removed. 
6. Manifestation of Enlightenment 
In the root text, the sixth point is called "manifestation." This 
literally means, "going into enlightenment" or "entering 
enlightenment." This sixth point indicates that enlightenment 
has been actualized. 
205. Beginningless, centerless and endless, 
completely indivisible, 
.free .from the-two, .free .from the three, stainless and concept­
free such is the dharmadhatu. Understanding of its nature 
is the vision of the yogin who abides in meditation. 
310 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
This verse is about the emptiness aspect of Buddhahood, the 
dharmadhatu, explained through five characteristics. 
0 The first characteristic that describes enlightenment is 
being uncreated because it is beginningless, centerless and 
endless. This means that enlightenment does not come into 
being at a given point and therefore cannot cease at another 
given point or abide in between these two points. 
0 The second characteristic is the indivisibility of 
emptiness and jnana. The dharmadhatu is associated with the 
emptiness of phenomena. Emptiness and jnana cannot exist 
separately as can, for example, a single rope made by taking 
white and black thread and braiding them together. Emptiness 
and jnana are naturally inseparable. One' is unable to exist 
without the other. The nature ofjnana is emptiness. The nature 
of that emptiness is jnana. In the same way, the emptiness itself 
is jnana. Emptiness manifests a quality ofluminous clarity that 
is not a blank like the ~on-existence of a rabbit's horns. It is 
very alive and this emptiness creates the possibility within which 
all phenomena can manifest. 
$ The third characteristic is "to be free from the two" 
which indicates that it is free from all extreme ideas. This 
characteristic of correct understanding, describes a state of mind 
that doesn't make any incorrect assumptions (overstatement) 
or negative attributions (understatement). A false assumption 
would be attributing a quality to something that doesn't possess 
that quality. A negative attribution denies the existence of a 
quality that is in fact actually present. Freedom from the two is 
to be free from these two distortions of the true nature of things. 
0 The fourth char~c.teristic is freedom from all 
obscurations or "veils." There is no longer any emotional 
obscuration, cognitive obscuration, or obstruction to stable 
meditation. When these three forms of obscuratiqn have 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vttjra Point 311 
dissolved, the stainlessness, the purity of enlightenment is 
revealed. 
0 The last characteristic of enlightenment is that it 
transcends discursive thought. Enlightenment is not an outer 
object. For this reason it cannot function as an object of 
discursive thoughts. The only way to understand enlightenment 
is through meditation. The supreme yogi (the Buddha) then 
rests within the nature of the dharmadhatu and in meditation 
can understand it. 
Dharmakaya Qualities 
206. Unfathomable, greater in number than sand 
grains in the Ganges, 
inconceivable and unequalled are the qualities 
of the immaculate space of the tathagata, 
purged of every defect and related conditioning. 
This verse explains the dharmakaya through five qualities, the 
first four qualities of the dharmakaya describe perfect 
knowledge. 
0 The dharmakaya possesses qualities which are 
unfathomable and which cannot be comprehended by the 
conceptual mind because they are so vast. The dharmakaya 
doesn't possess a solid reality therefore it is present everywhere. 
The fact th~t· it is unfathomable means that there are so many 
qualities which are so vast and so deep that one cannot even 
discern what exactly they are. 
0 The second quality of the dharmakaya is that the 
qualities it possesses are infinitely great. The dharmakaya has 
so many qualities that one cannot count them precisely. 
312 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
• The third quality is inconceivability because the 
dharmakaya is so deep that one cannot understand it easily. 
• The fourth quality of the dharmakaya is incomparability 
because there is nothing else to which it can be compared. It 
cannot be compared to ordinary phenomena because ordinary 
phenomena are emotionally tainted. Neither can it be compared 
to the fruition of the Hinayana path. 
• The fifth quality is the manifestation of the complete 
purity of Buddhahood. The verse says "the immaculate space 
of the tathagata" which means that the dharmakaya is 
completely free of all obscurations including the very fine traces 
left behind by those obscurations. 
Sambhogakaya Qualities 
207. By various facets of the true dharma, 
through its radiant embodiments and diligence 
in accomplishing the aim of liberating beings, 
its deeds are like those of a king of wishing-gems. 
Although it takes different 'substantial'forms, 
it is not really of such a character. 
The five characteristics of sambhogakaya: 
• The sambhogakaya manifests as the deep and vast aspect 
of dharma. The deep aspect of dharma refers to emptiness and 
the vast aspect refers to the various levels practiced on the path. 
The sambhogakaya is the manifestation of the speech of the 
Buddha that manifests without interruption. 
• The second quality of the sambhogakaya is that of the 
Buddha's body which is adorned with the thirty-two marks and 
the eighty signs of beauty. These appear as a radiant body which 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vtzjra Point 313 
manifests to realized bodhisattvas in this very brilliant, pure 
form. 
$ The third quality is that of the Buddha's mind. In the 
sambhogakaya his mind is always engaged in helping liberate 
all beings. This compassionate mind manifests to realized 
bodhisattvas. 
$ The fourth quality is related to the activity of the 
sambhogakaya. The activity of the sambhogakaya can be 
compared to a wish-fulfilling jewel that can accomplish 
anything without thought or effort. The activities of the 
sambhogakaya are accomplished spontaneously, without any 
effort. 
$ The fifth quality is the manner in which this activity 
of the sambhogakaya actually manifests by appearing in many 
different substantial forms to beings and performing many 
different kinds of deeds that guide them to liberation. While 
the sambhogakaya manifests as substantial forms, it is 
insubstantial. 
Nirmanakaya Qualities 
208. The form aspects are the cause, establishing 
worldlings on the path to peace, bringing them to 
maturity and predicting. 
Moreover, their presence always graces these worlds 
just as space is the constant abode of the element of form. 
The nirmanakaya of the Buddha as it manifests in the three 
different stages is the basis for the liberation of beings. First, in 
the nirmanakaya form, the Buddha causes ordinary beings to 
enter the path of liberation leading them away from samsara. 
Second, once beings have entered the path, the Buddhas enable 
314 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
them to purify their defilements and gain realization. In the 
third stage if someone has developed fully on the path, the 
nirmanakaya will predict when a person will become a Buddha 
and in which Buddha field he or she will go and what his or 
her name will be. 
The nirmanakaya of the Buddha is always present in our 
world. However the nirmanakaya is not permanent in nature, 
but the permanence of continuity of Buddha activity. A Buddha 
enters our world and then passes away. One could think that 
Buddha activity then stops at this point. But this is not the 
case because once a Buddha has passed away another Buddha 
appears continuing the enlightened activity of the Tathagatas. 
The spontaneous presence of Buddha activity in our world can 
be compared to the way in which the form realms abide in 
space. In the same way, Buddha activity is always present in 
our world. 
209. That called 'the self-existent,' 'omniscience,' 
'Buddhahood;' 'supreme nirvana,' 'inconceivability,' 
'victory over the enemy' and the 'self-nature. ' 
Enlightenment takes three different forms; through the 
dharmakaya, the sambhogakaya, and the nirmanakaya. This 
three-fold manifestation can be described in terms of seven 
names. 
0 First, enlightenment is called "self-existent" or 
"spontaneously present" because it does not rely on anything 
else, depending entirely on th~ presence of the Buddha-essence 
within us. 
0 The second name is "all-knowing" or "omniscient" 
which refers to the perfect knowledge of the Buddha. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth vajra Point 315 
0 The third name is "Buddhahood" which is derived from 
the word dharmakaya and covers both the quality of complete 
purity and full knowledge. 
0 The fourth name is "supreme nirvana" in which the 
word "supreme" is added to "nirvana" because nirvana 
transcends suffering. The arhats also believe that they transcend 
suffering. For this reason the word "supreme" is added to 
indicate that enlightenment transcends even the nirvana of the 
arhats. 
0 The fifth name is "inconceivability" because 
enlightenment is not the object of intellectual speculation and 
can only be understood by means of the most profound prajna. 
0 The sixth name is "victory over the enemy'' in which 
samsara is compared to the enemy a11d Buddhahood to the 
complete victory over that enemy. 
0 The seventh is "self-nature" or "self-cognizant nature" 
because Buddhahood is· the obje~t of the realization of the self­
cognizant jnana. It is the nature that knows itsel£ 
210. is categorized according to its qualities 
of profundity, vastness and magnanimity 
through the essence-kaya and so forth. 
Enlightenment also manifests in three ways: as profundity or 
depth, which is related to the dharmakaya because it is very 
difficult to understand; as vastness, a characteristic which is 
related to th~-sambhogakaya insofar as it possesses great powers 
to help beings; as magnanimity or greatness of nature, a 
characteristic which is related to the nirmanakaya, and its 
infinite compas~ion which allows this nirmanakaya to manifest 
in many different forms of activity which corresponds directly 
to the karma and capabilities of individual sentient beings. 
316 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The Svabhavikakaya 
211. Of these, the Buddhas' essence-kaya should be 
known as having five intrinsic characteristics and, 
in brief five qualities. 
212. It is uncreated and indivisible, 
utterly purged, purified of the two extremes, 
definitively liberated .from the 
three obscurations -
defilements, ideas and hindrances to mastery in meditation 
213. it is stainless, completely beyond concepts and 
it is luminous clarit]> through being the domain of the yogin 
and through the dharmadhatu being quintessentially pure. 
The svabhavikakaya of the dharmakaya has five intrinsic 
characteristics and five outward qualities. 
0 The first characteristic is that it is uncreated. The 
dharmakaya is uncreated because it has no beginning, does not 
abide anywhere and it has no end. It is also the indivisible union 
of the untainted dharmadhatu and the perfectly realized jnana. 
This dharmadhatu is the emptiness aspect of the true nature 
that is completely free of the four extremes and the eight mental 
fabrications. This emptiness is explained in the second turning 
of the wheel of dharma. In the relative sense everything appears, 
but ultimately everything is empty. This corresponds to the 
teachings on the presence of the Buddha-essence in the mind 
of all beings that were given in the third. turning. In this way 
the dharmadhatu and jnana are perfectly united. 
0 The second characteristic of the dharmakaya is that it 
is completely free of the two extremes of adding to something 
that is not there or removing something that isn't there in the 
first place. It is just as it is. When practicing on the path, it is 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 317 
within this nature that one learns to rest the mind in meditation 
and to recognize the jnana of insight. At the beginning one 
learns at a theoretical level that the true nature of existence is 
the indivisibility of emptiness and luminous clarity. Eventually 
one gains a definite conviction that this is true and allows oneself 
to be immersed in that true nature during meditation. 
0 The third characteristic is that it is completely free from 
emotional and cognitive obscurations and free from the 
obscuration that prevents one from mastering the practice of 
meditation. 
$ The fourth characteristic is that it is free of the 
obscurations so that the svabhavikakaya is flawless. 
0 The fifth characteristic is luminous clarity. Because the 
dharmakaya is stainless, it is not the object of intellectual 
speculation but the object of the cognition of the supreme yogis 
who abide continually in the union of prajna and skillful means 
(Skt. upaya). It also manifests as complete luminous clarity 
because the dharmadhatu is itself, by nature, completely pure. 
214. The svabhavikakaya is truly endowed with the 
qualities of inestimability, incalculability, inconceivability, 
incomparability and ultimate purity. 
There are five outward 59 qualities of the svabhavikakaya. 
$ The first quality is that it is immeasurable because it 
cannot be f~thomed in any way. It. is not like an ordinary 
composite ~bject that can investigated in terms of its color, 
form, and different attributes. 
$ The sec~nd quality is not being countable. If one takes 
any ordinary object, one can count it, but it is impossible to 
count the svabhavikakaya. 
$ The third quality is inconceivability. All ordinary objects 
can be comprehended intellectually because they have form, 
318 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
sound, shape, taste, and so on but the svabhavikakaya is free 
from the four extremes and the eight conceptual fabrications. 
$ The fourth quality is that it is incomparable. The 
svabhavikakaya is not totally blank because its great luminous 
clarity can be perceived by the yogi who can apprehend it by 
means of his or her self-cognizant jnana. 
$ The fifth quality is ultimate purity from which all the 
subtle traces of the emotional, cognitive and meditative 
obscurations have been removed. 
215. It is respectively immeasurable and so forth 
because it is vast, unquantifiable, beyond the scope 
of intellectual speculation, unique and rid of even 
conditioning. 
There are five·reasons for these qualities. 
$ The svabhavikakaya is immeasurable because it is so 
vast that there is no way in which it can be apprehended by 
ordinary means. 
$ It is uncountable because there is nothing solid to 
account for. 
$ It is completely inconceivable since it transcends the 
four extremes and the eight conceptual fabrications. If we try 
to examine it using discursive thought, it cannot be 
apprehended because it doesn't have the characteristics of 
ordinary objects. It also cannot be understood in terms of 
existence or non-existence. For this reason ordinary beings 
cannot grasp the svabhavikakaya. 
$ It is incomparable because the Buddha possesses 
qualities that are not shared by anyone else. 
$ Finally, it is ultimately pure because it lacks even the 
very fine mental traces of the obscurations. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth ~jra Point 319 
The Sambhogakaya 
216. lt,takes the form of perfect expression because 
it perfectly uses the various dharmas, it manifests 
real attributes, 
it has uninterrupted activity which benefits beings, 
as it is the natural outflow of pure compassion, 
217. it fulfills aspirations, completely, exactly, 
spontaneously and without conceptual agitation, 
and because it has miraculous abilities, 
like those of a wish-fulfilling gem. 
In general, the Buddha has two form kayas (sambhogakaya and 
nirmanakaya). The sambhogakaya is the ultimate form kaya, 
which manifests to those bodhisattvas with very pure karma. 
This occurs not because the Buddha thinks, "This person can 
see me because he is good." It is simply a function of the way 
in which beings perceive the forms of the Buddha. Beings who 
are quite pure can perceive the sambhogakaya. Beings who are 
less pure can perceive only the nirmanakaya form. This can be 
illustrated by an example of the reflection of the moon in 
water. If the moon reflects in a very clear pond, the image of 
the moon is very clear. If it reflects in very dirty water, the 
image of the moon is less clear. In the same way, bodhisattvas 
on the ten levels are quite pure, so they can perceive the 
sambhogakaya form of the Buddha. Beings who are less pure 
can only perceive the nirmanakaya, even though Buddha­
activity is occurring all the time. When beings are not ready, 
the Buddha will teach them a simpler way of understanding 
things in order to lead them gradually to comprehending the 
real truth. At the sambhogakaya level only the absolute truth 
is taught and the Buddha at this level doesn't need to use 
320 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
examples or simplified explanations because he manifests to 
beings that are already realized. 
0 The first quality of the sambhogakaya is the speech that 
expresses all the aspects of the dharma at all times. 
0 The second quality of the sambhogakaya is the body in 
which the activity of the Buddha occurs continually and 
unceasingly manifests through many different emanations. The 
sambhogakaya represents the emanations that faithfully reflect 
the nature of the dharmakaya itsel£ In the example of the 
reflection of the moon in water, the sambhogakaya form is the 
faithful reflection of the qualities of the dharmakaya. It is said 
that the qualities of the body of the sambhogakaya manifest 
the real qualities of the dharmakaya. 
0 The third quality of the sambhogakaya is the mind that 
is the pure compassion of the Buddha. The natural outflow of 
this compassion provides unceasing assistance to all beings. 
From the compassion of the Buddha springs the sambhogakaya. 
The sambhogakaya, in turn, is the source of Buddha activity. 
Even the activity of the nirmanakaya springs from the 
compassion of the sambhogakaya, which is the expression of 
the compassion of the dharmakaya. 
0 The fourth quality of the sambhogakaya is that it 
manifests as the Buddha's activity. The activity of the 
sambhogakaya is completely spontaneous and it entirely satisfies 
all the wishes ofbeings, but it.is unplanned and is not controlled 
by any form of conceptualization. 
0 The fifth quality of the sambhogakaya is that it 
manifests as something that is not really its true nature, like 
the wish-fulfilling gem. For example, if one puts a gem against 
a background of color it will manifest that color, although that 
color is not an aspect of the nature of the gem. In the same 
way, the sambhogakaya manifests in miraculous ways of 
appearing which are not its real nature. Because the 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 321 
sambhogakaya is never divorced from the dharmakaya it is 
forever abiding in the dharmakaya. 
218. It is shown here in five facets, those of 
uninterrupted speech, 
emanations and deeds, and through the fact that 
these are not at all contrived 
and do not manifest its true identity. 
The sambhogakaya has five different aspects. 
0 The first is uninterrupted speech, of continually 
presenting profound and vast teachings to the pure disciples. 
0 The second aspect is the uninterrupted emanation of 
body. The sambhogakaya manifests the true qualities of 
enlightenment to the realized bodhisattvas. What the realized 
bodhisattvas see is a form that is adorned with all the marks 
and signs of a Buddha. 
0 The third aspect is the mind of the sambhogakaya that 
is constantly engaged in activity which helps beings as the 
manifestation of its pure non-conceptual .compassion. This 
compassion helps both pure and impure beings. 
0 The fo~rth aspect of the manifestation of the 
sambhogakaya is the spontaneous activity of the other three 
aspects, of body, speech and mind of the sambhogakaya. The 
sambhogakaya body is constantly manifesting physically, and 
the mind fS continually acting to help pure beings, and the 
speech is constantly giving spontaneous teachings. 
0 The fifth aspect of the manifestation of the 
sambhogakaya js that it is able to appear in forms that transcend 
the true nature. The sambhogakaya appears in forms that 
correspond to the spiritual maturity of beings. To pure beings 
it emanates in the form of the sambhogakaya and to impure 
beings it appears in the form of the nirmanakaya. It displays 
322 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
visible forms, but these are not its actual nature because its true 
nature is the dharmakaya. 
219. just as a gem it not really the various hues it 
can assume, 
so likewise is the all-embracing not as it appears to be 
through the circumstances of various beings. 
For example, a jewel may appear to be the different colors of 
the background it is placed in front of, but the gem itself has 
no such colors. The gem does not have a nature of being white, 
yellow, blue etc., but because it is very transparent, the colors 
of the background can be seen in the jewel. In the same way, 
enlightenment can manifest in different forms due to the various 
circumstances created by beings. The dharmakaya does not 
change, but reflects all of the various conditions in which beings 
find themselves as it manifests to them. 
Nirmanakaya 
The nirmanakaya referred to here is the supreme nirmanakaya 
that appears as the historical Buddha manifesting the thirty­
two marks and eighty signs on his body and sixty different 
qualities of speech. This is the form of the Buddha we know as 
both the Buddha Shakyamuni, and the Buddha Maitreya who 
will manifest in the future. The nirmanakaya is represented by 
the one thousand Buddhas that will be born in this present 
world cycle. All of these Buddhas will carry out various activities 
that will benefit beings. The Shakyamuni Buddha performed 
twelve main activities or deeds on the path to liberation. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 323 
Twelve Deeds of the Buddha 
220. Through greatest compassion knowing all worlds, 
having seen all worlds, while never leaving the dharmakaya, 
through various forms, apparitional by nature, 
the one excellently born into the highest birth 
221. descends .from the 'Realm of Great joy, ' 
enters the royal womb and is nobly born in ]ambudvipa. 
Perfectly skilled in each science and art, 
222. delighting in his royal consorts' company, 
then renouncing, 
practicing the path of hardship and difficulty, 
going to the place called 'Enlightenment's Very Heart,' 
he vanquishes the hosts of evil. 
The ground of Buddha activity is the dharmakaya. The 
sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya manifest to help beings, 
emanating from the dharmakaya unchanged and without being 
separate from the dharmakaya. The Buddha sees all worlds just 
as they are and with his compassion he perceives the suffering 
of beings. The Buddha knows that if these beings practice, they 
will achieve enlightenment because all beings are endowed with 
Buddha-essence. So having seen the world through his great 
compassion and having seen the need to help these beings 
without departing from the dharmakaya, the Buddha helps 
them by manifesting the form kayas. 
First the Buddha took birth as a god in a paradise called 
Tushita which 'is a place of great happiness. When he was-in 
Tushita, he taught the dharma to the gods. Although this was 
the first deed of the Buddha, it is not counted as one of the 
twelve deeds because the twelve deeds refer to activities that 
324 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on .Buddha-Essence 
take place in our world. Before he left Tushita, he appointed 
the bodhisattva Maitreya to represent the Buddhas in Tushita 
and empowered him to give teachings there. 
1. Before the Buddha came into our world, he had five 
visions. He saw the caste he would _be born into, his mother, 
the place of his birth, the kind of people with whom he would 
be associated and the time. He saw that he would be born in a 
royal family as a member of the highest caste. If he had been 
born as a member of a low caste he would have automatically 
been cut off from most people. The previous Buddha, Buddha 
Kashyapa, was born in a Brahmin family for a similar reason. 
At the time the Brahmins enjoyed the greatest prestige. Buddha 
Shakyamuni was born into a royal family because during his 
lifetime the royal caste had the greatest prestige. Then he saw 
his mother, who yvas worthy of bearing a Buddha. Next he saw 
his body with all of the perfect marks and signs inside her womb. 
He also saw that the beings associated with him lived in India. 
For this reason, it was clear that India would be the right place 
for him to manifest, where he would be of most benefit. He 
also saw that 500 B.C.E. was the right time to manifest because 
beings were spiritually ready for his coming. Having 
foreseen 
these five things, the Buddha left Tushita and entered our world. 
2. The second deed was to enter the womb of his mother. 
His mother experienced his emergence as a white elephant with 
six tusks that entered her womb. 
3. The third deed Was to take birth in a normal way from 
his mother's womb. Actually, the Buddha had the power to be 
born in anyway he chose. He could have appeared miraculously 
from a lotus (as did Padmasambhava) or simply appeared from 
the sky. However, he chose to manifest in a normal birth because 
all of the beings he hoped to benefit, including his disciples, 
were born from the womb. Had the Buddha been born in some 
miraculous form, they might have thought, "Oh, we are not 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 325 
like him because he has just fallen from space and can do all 
these things, but we can't do them because we are just ordinary 
people." So he took a normal birth to show that he shared the 
conditions of all humans. 
4. The fourth deed was that he became very proficient in 
all arts and crafts. When the Buddha was a little boy, he was 
introduced to the different aspects of knowledge. He learned 
to write in the sixty different languages, learned all the different 
skills, the martial arts, and all of the aspects of knowledge. He 
became extremely proficient in all of these areas. He 
accumulated all of these accomplishments so that later, when 
he taught, no one could say, "Well, he is teaching all these 
things involving the spiritual life because he was a failure in 
worldly things." 
5. The fifth deed that he accomplished was to enjoy the 
company of his wife and the consorts who lived in his father's 
palace. This was to eliminate the belief that he was so 
extraordinary simply because he didn't know what pleasure was 
all about. To offset this belief the Buddha thoroughly enjoyed 
the pleasures of this world. Later he taught that there is no 
need to become involved with these pleasures and cling to them 
because they are eventually unsatisfactory, as they do not last 
forever. Instead, he taught that one should practice the way to 
liberation without attachment. 
6 & 7. The sixth and seventh deeds were to eliminate the 
extreme of_overindulgence in pleasures and enjoyment without 
caring for anything else and the extreme of practicing too many 
hardships with the expectation that this austerity will bring 
liberation. To 4emonstrate the pointlessness of these extremes, 
the Buddha renounced the world. At the time the Buddha had 
been enjoying the pleasures of his palace and his wife and 
consorts. To indicate this was too much of a fetter, he secretly 
fled from the palace at night, cut off his hair, found a teacher, 
326 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
and practiced extreme austerities for six years by the banks of a 
river. He did this to demonstrate that practicing austerities was 
not the way to achieve realization. Instead, he taught that the 
final realization is seated in the understanding of the true nature 
of the mind. 
8. The eighth deed he accomplished was to go to·Bodhgaya 
(a city in India), which is known as "the heart of 
enlightenment." This is the place to which the one thousand 
Buddhas of this time cycle will go to reach enlightenment. 
9. His ninth deed was to vanquish the host of maras, 60 the 
demons. The true meaning of this is that through his varja-like 
samadhi the Buddha became victorious over all the defilements 
that were known as the demon of the aggregates, the demon of 
defilements and so on. These demons or obstacles appeared in 
front of him to keep him from reaching Buddhahood. They 
tried to stop him and distract him by employing attachment, 
aggression and ignorance: in order to distract him, the demons 
created a very beautiful woman who attempted to seduce him 
by arousing his passion, but the Buddha overcame this. They 
then sent a messenger who said that his father had died and 
Devadatta, an enemy of the Buddha, was going to take over 
the kingdom. They also attempted to arouse his anger by 
producing a tremendous army of ferocious demons who 
attacked the Buddha with amazing displays of negative miracles. 
But the whole time, the Buddha simply remained in meditation, 
immersed in a state of loving kindness unswayed by desire, 
anger, or delusion. 
10. In this way, he demonstrated the tenth deed, which 
was to achieve perfect enlightenment. 
223. Then, perfect enlightenment, the turning of the wheel 
of dharma and passing into supreme nirvana. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 327 
In all these places, so impure, 
the nirmanakaya shows these deeds as long as worlds endure. 
11. Having achieved enlightenment, the Buddha performed 
the eleventh deed, turning the wheel of dharma. The first 
turning teaches the Four Noble Truths which trains the disciples 
of the Hinayana. The second turning explains emptiness and 
the original nature of everything, which is the dharmadhatu. 
The third turning was the teachings on the luminous clarity 
aspect ofjnana that showed that the true nature ofeverything 
is the union ofluminous clarity and emptiness and was intended 
for bodhisattvas who could reach enlightenment. 
12. The twelfth deed of the Buddha was to appear to die. 
The Buddha could see that if he remained among human beings 
all the time, they would not develop a real sense of renunciation. 
To kindle weariness of their samsaric existence in beings and to 
develop a wish for liberation, the Buddha appeared to die. 
Progressive Training 
224. Knowing the means (through such terms as 
'impermanence,' 'suffering,' 'no-self' and 'peace'), 
the nirmanakaya instills weariness with the world 
in beings of the three dimensions, thus causing them 
to apply themselves to the transcendence ofsujfering. 
In his nirmanakaya emanation the Buddha helped beings by 
first accomplishing the twelve deeds. The second way he 
helped beings was by enabling them to reach liberation or 
"ripening" them. The Buddha helps ordinary beings enter the 
Hinayana by guiding them in the understanding of that path. 
When beings are more spiritually developed, he guides them 
328 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
into the Mahayana and helps them relinquish their 
emotional and cognitive obscurations until they are able to 
reach enlightenment. 
The Buddha offers guidance to all beings, including those 
who have not yet had any contact with the Buddha's teachings, 
by introducing them to the Hinayana path. He teaches the 
relative truth first hecause the absolute truth is quite difficult 
to understand. He teaches that all composite phenomena are 
impermanent and that everything that is tainted by emotional 
impurities automatically produces suffering and that all these 
conditions and tainted phenomena are devoid of any self and 
that even this subject that seems to be apprehending 
phenomena is itself not real. In this way, beings are taught 
the three characteristics of samsara: impermanence, suffering, 
and non-self. 
Once beings understand impermanence and suffering, they 
will want to eliminate them. Once they understand that all 
phenomena are devoid of a fixed substantial identity, they will 
want to relinquish the illusion and transcend it. Therefore, the 
teaching of non-self benefits beings by motivating them to 
attempt to transcend suffering, impermanence, and a mistaken 
belief in. a self, by propelling them towards nirvana. In the 
immediate future these teachings benefit beings by bringing 
them onto the path. In the distant future the teachings that are 
the foundation of the Hinayana path enable beings to liberate 
themselves from samsara and to achieve a state of peace. 
225. To those excellently established on the path of peace, 
who believe that they have already attained nirvana, 
it teaches the thatness of all phenomena, 
in the 'White Lotus' and other {sutra}. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 329 
The second turning and the bodhisattva path teachings are given 
to those beings that have already entered the path to peace, but 
mistakenly believe that they have already achieved nirvana. In 
order to correct this misunderstanding, teachings such as the 
Lotus Sutra (Saddharma-unkarika) describe the real nature of 
phenomena and teach that they have not achieved final 
enlightenment. In order to reach this final enlightenment they 
are taught that tl}ey must develop two qualities. They must 
develop prajna, which leads them to understand that they must 
transcend conditioned existence. Simultaneously, they must 
develop the true compassion that is unsupported by any 
concepts. This compassion coupled with prajna motivates them 
to aspire for more than their own peace. So these beings that 
have achieved peace for themselves are taught they must go on 
to reach perfect enlightenment. 
226. Through this, they turn away from theirformer 
belief and are inspired to properly adopt wisdom and 
skillful means. 
It brings them to maturity within the highest yana 
and predicts their enlightenment supreme. 
With the aid of these teachings practitioners of the Hinayana 
are brought into the fold of the Mahayana, through which they 
undergo a change of motivation and acquire real prajna. 
Gradually, they grow to understand the non-existence of a 
personal self and the non-existence of phenomena. As these 
changes occur they begin to cultivate the skillful means of 
compassion united with deeper understanding (prajna). 
The first aspect of this Buddha activity, the immediate 
result of this dharma taught by the nirmanakaya, is that it 
leads beings onto the path to peace and brings them into the 
fold of the Hinayana. 
330 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Secondly, the Buddha introduces them to the absolute 
meaning of the teachings a:nd places them on the Mahayana 
path. 
The third aspect of Buddha activity is enlightenment. When 
beings have reached the pure eighth, ninth, and tenth 
bodhisattva levels, the Buddha predicts their future 
enlightenment. He will say, "Later on in such and such a time 
cycle (Skt. kalpa), you will become a Buddha with the name of 
so and so, and have disciples by the names of so and so, your 
teachings will endure for such and such duration of time, and 
your Buddha field will be called such and such." 
How the Kayas are Grouped 
227. Being profound, the very best of all powers and 
the most clever guidance for the immature, 
according to their individual needs, these are known, 
respectively, as 'deep, ' 'vast, 'and 'great by nature. ' 
The kayas of the Buddha are the dharmakaya, sambhogakaya 
and the nirmanakaya. The dharmakaya is the most difficult to 
understand because it is beyond the four extremes and the eight 
mental fabrications. 
The sambhogakaya is characterized by great power. The 
nirmanakaya, on the other hand, directs itself to what beings 
need. When the nirmanakaya manifests in a given place, all 
the beings who live in that place won't necessarily enter the 
dharma. However, when the sambhogakaya Buddha teaches in 
a given Buddha field, all the beings that are present enter the 
dharma because they are already very close t9 final realization. 
The sambhogakaya manifestation, in effect, teaches final 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 331 
realization and is extremely powerful because it expresses the 
absolute meaning of the teachings. 
The nirmanakaya Buddha, on the other hand, expresses 
the teachings in such a way that beings can relate directly to 
them. This emanation introduces students to the relative level 
of the teachings. For this reason the nirmanakaya Buddha 
appears in forms that are actual experiences of beings. 
228. The first of the above is dharmakaya and the 
latter the form kaya. 
just as forms abide in space, the latter abide in the former. 
To summarize, the dharmakaya is the depth, the very expression 
of the dharmadhatu. The sambhogakaya represents the vastness 
of Buddha activity that is all-powerful. The nirmanakaya 
represents greatness of nature, which means that it is imbued 
with great compassion that makes it possible for Buddha activity 
to express itself directly to beings. The Buddha kayas can also 
be divided into the dharmakaya, which expresses the true nature 
of phenomena, and the other two form kayas. The 
sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya are called the form kayas 
because they are the kayaS' people can actually see and to which 
they can relate directly to. However, these two form kayas are 
always present in the dharmakaya in the same way that visible 
objects are present in space. 
7. Permanence 
229. Through infinite causes, 
an inexhaustible number of beings, 
compassionate love, miraculous powers, perfect knowledge, 
having the 'best possible' and mastery over all qualities, 
332 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
through having vanquished the evil of death, 
insubstantiality and being the protector of the worlds, 
theyare permanent. 
The very nature of enlightenment is changeless and immutable. 
The dharmakaya enjoys the permanence of nature, the 
sambhogakaya the permanence of continuity, and the 
nirmanakaya the permanence of being uninterrupted. This will 
be explained employing ten different reasons -seven for the 
form kayas and three for the dharmakaya. 
1. The first reason for permanence of the form kayas is that 
there are an endless variety of conditions through which 
Buddhahood can be achieved. For instance, one condition for 
realizing Buddhahood is the accumulation of virtue by 
practicing the six paramitas. Another condition is the 
accumulation of insight that is accomplished through 
meditation. When these two accumulations have been 
completed the two form kayas will manifest as the result of 
these endless causes and will be able to manifest permanently 
to all different beings: the sambhogakaya with its permanence 
of continuity and the nirmanakaya with its permanence of being 
uninterrupted. 
2. The second reason that the form kayas are permanent is 
that there are. an inexhaustible number of beings. Buddha 
activity will express itself as long as there are beings. Since the 
number of beings is so inexhaustible, it will always be necessary 
for the form kayas to manifest in order to help them. If one 
being has been liberated, there are still many, many other beings 
that are still suffering. 
3. The third reason that the form kayas are permanent is 
the great compassionate love of the Buddha. If the Buddhas 
weren't continually inspired by compassion, their activity would 
stop. However, the compassion of the Buddhas is non-
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 3.33 
referentiaL For this reason their activity is continuous, in the 
same way that a mother always has love for her only son. 
4. The fourth reason that the form kayas are permanent is 
that they possess miraculous powers. Even if the Buddhas had 
compassion, if they did not have the power to make this activity 
possible, then it wouldn't take place. But the Buddhas do have 
miraculous powers so that they can continually manifest 
whatever is necessary to benefit beings. 
5. The fifth reason that the form kayas are permanent is 
that the Buddhas have realized the sameness of samsara and 
nirvana and do not experience themselves as defiled or polluted 
by samsara when helping beings that are trapped in that state. 
6. The sixth reason is that the kayas manifest untainted 
happiness. 
7. The seventh reason that they are permanent is that they 
have mastery over all qualities. 
The next three reasons explain the permanence of the 
dharmakaya. 
8. The dharmakaya is permanent because the evil of death 
has been vanquished. 
9. Ninth is that the dharmakaya has no material essence; it 
is not of a conditioned nature, therefore it is permanent. 
10. The tenth reason is that the dharmakaya is the protector 
of the world and pervades everything. 
The first four reasons above explain why it is that the form 
kayas are corstantly present in samsara and the next three 
reasons explain why they cannot forsake samsara. In more detail: 
230. They are permanent because they uphold the 
true dharma, 
having devoted their body, life and resources to it, 
because they completely fulfill their promise to 
benefit beings, 
334 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
1. To begin with, the form kayas are always present in 
samsara because the bodhisattvas hold the true dharma, having 
for eons devoted their bodies, lives, and resources to the benefit 
of beings. The form kayas manifest due to endless causes that 
consist in all the virtuous actions done by the bodhisattvas for 
endless eons. 
2. The second reason for permanence is that the Buddhas 
act for the benefit of all beings. They do not act simply for the 
benefit of their own countrymen, relatives, or disciples. When 
they step onto the Mahayana path, they took a vow to reach 
enlightenment for the sake of all beings. 
231. because the stainless and pure compassion of the 
Buddhas permeates each and every being, 
because they manifest through the bases of 
miraculous powers, 
by which they display abiding. 
3. Since there are an inexhaustible number of beings to be 
liberated from samsara, the form kayas are permanent. If the 
Buddhas didn't have compassion, this activity would eventually 
stop. However, inspired by compassion they constantly help 
\>eings. For this reason, they manifest continuously. 
4. Fourth, even if the Buddhas were willing to help, if 
they did not have the power to come to the aid of beings, no 
Buddha-activity could take place. The Buddhas, however, 
possess full miraculous powers. They can help beings in 
whatever ways needed. 
232. because, having perfict knowledge, they are freed 
from believing in a samsara-and-nirvana duality, 
because they have the very best of bliss, 
of constant and unimaginable samadhi, 
Enlightenment- The Fifth ~jra Point 335 
The following three reasons explain why the form kayas of 
the Buddhas do not forsake samsara. 
5. If the Buddhas saw sam sara as bad and nirvana as good, 
they would be inclined to give up samsara and abide in nirvana. 
This would be an obstacle to the accomplishment of Buddha 
activity to help other beings. However, they possess perfect 
knowledge so they understand that nirvana and samsara are 
inseparable and therefore they manifest continually in samsara 
to help beings. 
6. The Buddhas also do not forsake the world because they 
possess the supreme bliss of samadhi. Even though the Buddhas 
experience the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, if they 
were forced to undergo terrible sufferings in samsara, after a 
time they would not be able to bear the pain. Instead they 
experience the supreme bliss of meditation (samadhi). 
233. because even though they act in the world, 
by worldly qualities they are unblemished, 
7. If the Buddhas understood the inseparability of samsara 
and nirvana but were still plagued by karma and obscuration, 
from time to time they would experience the suffering of 
samsara again. This would hinder their Buddha-activity and 
would eventually render them powerless. Therefore, the third 
reason that the form kayas remain continually in the world to 
help beings is that they are not polluted by worldly impurities. 
233. (Cont'd) because, being immortal and having 
attained the state of peace, 
there is no opportunity for the evil of death, 
8. The first of three reasons that the dharmakaya is 
permanent is that it is immortal. In samsara, one has to 
336 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
experience birth, which implies sickness, old age, and death. 
However, for the Buddhas there is no longer any death because 
the causes of death have been removed. The Buddhas have 
totally eradicated all obscurations which frees them from karma 
and therefore places them beyond the reach of death. 
234. because the Victors, whose nature is uncreated, 
have been for ever perfectly at peace 
and because they are most suited as a refuge and so forth 
for those without a refuge. 
9. The second reason is that the nature of the dharmakaya 
is uncreated. From the beginning of time Buddhahood has been 
free from birth, old age, sickness, and death. The Buddhas have 
realized this uncreated true nature, perceiving it as it is and 
manifesting it' in this same way. This nature is perfectly at peace 
and beyond all conditioned phenomena. The original uncreated 
origin of the true nature is made manifest in Buddhahood and 
that is why Buddhahood is permanent. 
10. The third reason that Buddhahood is permanent is that 
it constitutes a permanent refuge for those who are without 
help. Why is this? Beings are subject to impermanence, 
~uffering, and dangers, but when the ultimate realization is 
achieved all these difficulties vanish. Therefore the one who 
embodies freedom from impermanence becomes the protection 
for all beings that are still subjected to change. 
235. The first seven reasons show the permanence of the 
form kaya and the last three show the permanence 
of dharmakaya. 
The form kayas are not permanent in the same way. As their 
name indicates they take form and form appears and 
Enlightenment- The Fifth VajraPoint 337 
subsequently dissolves. They are not permanent in nature and 
are not therefore free from impermanence. However, the 
sambhogakaya manifests the permanence ofbeing continuous 
because the five definite characteristics that describe it ensure 
that the sambhogakaya Buddha-fields can never change. The 
sambhogak.aya itself never passes away, so it has the permanence 
of being unceasing. 
The nirmanakaya has the permanence of being 
uninterrupted. A Buddha comes and gives his teaching and 
then passes away, but his or her Buddha activity doesn't stop. 
This nirmanakaya form will manifest in another place so that 
Buddha activity is uninterrupted. 
8. Inconceivability of Enlightenment 
236. Since it is ineffable, consists of the ultimately true, 
is not the object of intellectual investigation, 
is beyond simile, is peerless and is comprised of 
neither compounded existence nor peace, ' 
it is the domain of the Buddhas, 
inconceivable for even the deeply realized. 
Enlightenment is inconceivable for six reasons. 
• First, it is inconceivable because it is ineffable which 
means that the qualities of enlightenment cannot be described 
in words. 
0 Second, it is the absolute truth. The Tibetan word for 
"relative truth" or reality is kunzop. The syllable kun means 
"all," and indicates that these objects can be apprehended by 
all (rather than just extraordinary) beings. The second syllable 
zop means "false." Everyone perceives these things in a manner 
that does not represent their true nature. Enlightenment consists 
338 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
of the ultimate truth which is the absolute truth or the way 
things truly are. 
0 Third, it is not the object of intellectual investigation 
because it transcends the four extremes and eight conceptual 
fabrications. 
0 Fourth, it is beyond comparisons. For this reason one 
cannot find any examples to describe it. 
$ Fifth, it is peerless. It is of the highest possible quality. 
One cannot find anything with which to compare it. 
0 Sixth, it is neither conditioned existence nor the peace 
of the arhats. 
In more detail: 
237. Inconceivable because it is ineffable, 
ineffable because it is ultimately true, 
ultimately true because it cannot be investigated 
intellectually, 
unable to be investigated by the intellect 
because it cannot be deduced, 
238. non-deducible because it is peerless, 
peerless because it does not comprise, and 
non-comprising because it does not abide, 
since qualities and faults are not contemplated. 
Enlightenment is inconceivable because it is ineffable. 
"Ineffable" means that it cannot be expressed in words. Ordinary 
objects of the relative world, say a pillar or a bowl, can be 
described in words. If an object can be represented by words, it 
can also be conceived of. However, Buddhahood cannot be 
described by words so it cannot be fully understood by ordinary 
mental consciousness. It is ineffable because it is the absolute 
truth. All ordinary objects have sound, taste, smell, etc. and 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 339 
can be apprehended by means of names, symbols, descriptions 
of existence and so on. Enlightenment, however, cannot be 
described in words because it is beyond the four extremes and 
eight conceptual fabrications. All one can do is describe it in 
terms of what it is not. 
Enlightenment is the absolute truth and it cannot be 
investigated intellectually. If one wants to investigate an object, 
one would have to apprehend it intellectually either directly or 
through deductive reasoning. To investigate intellectually, one 
has to use reason and to use reason one has to rely on terms of 
comparison. Since enlightenment is peerless there's nothing to 
which it could be compared. If one cannot ma-ke any 
deductions, one cannot construct any inferences that properly 
characterize enlightenment because it is not comprised of 
samsara or nirvana. Therefore there is nothing to which it could 
be compared. 
These six reasons explain why it is that Buddhahood is called 
inconceivable. Accompanying these six reasons are two specific 
qualities ofBuddha-essence. Buddhahood never abides in either 
samsara or in the selfish peace of the arhats. It does not abide 
in either because it transcends all conceptual content. Therefore 
the seventh and eighth reasons that Buddhahood is called 
inconceivable are that it does not abide in either samsara or 
nirvana and includes no concept of the faults of samsara. 
239. For five reasons is the dharmakaya inconceivable, 
and through them it is extremely subtle. 
Through the sixth reason are the form kaya inconceivable, 
as they are non-substantial. 
There are five reasons that the dharmakaya is inconceivable. 
~ The dharmakaya is ineffable because 
~ it con.sists of the ultimate truth, 
340 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
~ it is not the object of intellectual investigation, 
~ it is beyond comparisons, and 
~ it is peerless. 
The dharmakaya therefore is extremely subtle, and being 
so subtle, it cannot be comprehended by the conceptual 
constituents of mind. 
~ The si~th reason is that it is not comprised of either 
conditioned existence or selfish peace. 
There are two more reasons for this: 
~ it is not comprised of either samsara or nirvana and 
thus, 
~ no concept of the defects of samsara are included in it. 
Since the seventh and)eighth reasons are not part of the 
object of phenomena present in any of the levels of existence 
they cannot be conceived of by mind. 
240. Through their attributes of unsurpassable jnana, 
great compassion and the like, 
the Victors have perfected every quality and are 
inconceivable. 
Therefore, this final point, the spontaneously present, 
is not even understood by great sages 
who have received empowerment. 
In summary, the Buddhas manifest unsurpassable qualities: 
unsurpassable primordial wisdom, and the unsurpassable 
compassion that is the power to help beings. They transcend 
conceptual formulations, Buddhahood which has just been 
described 1n terms of eight points is, in fact, beyond all 
descriptions. The Buddhas are also called the "spontaneously 
present ones," meaning Buddhahood is not created by anything 
else or dependent upon something external. They are 
continually self-arising and they realize their own Buddhahood. 
Enlightenment- The Fifth Vajra Point 341 
When these spontaneously present ones reach enlightenment, 
they have reached the last point on their journey. They begin 
with making a resolution to reach Buddhahood for the sake 
of all beings. When they have reached enlightenment, this is 
also the culmination of refuge and the final goal of every being. 
So this final distinction cannot be conceived of by any being. 
Even bodhisattvas on the tenth level cannot conceive of 
Buddhahood. For this reason Buddhahood is even more 
inconceivable for bodhisattvas on the lower levels, not to 
mention ordinary beings. 
This was the second chapter, on "Enlightenment" from the 
Analysis of the Potential of the Rare and Supreme in this 
Ultimate Mahayana Treatise on the Changeless Continuity 
of the True Nature. 

THE QUALITIES OF BUDDHAHOOD 
The Sixth Vajra Point 
The Qualities in Terms of the Kayas 
241. Fulfillment for oneself and benefit for others are 
the ultimately true kaya and its dependent relative kaya. 
The fruits of freedom and perfect maturity 
are their sixty-four qualities. 343 
THE QUALITIES of enlightenment are expressed in terms of 
the two principal kayas: 
~ the qualities which lead to fulfillment for oneself are 
manifested~ at the level of absolute truth or the dharmakaya 
and, 
~ the qu,_alities that are of value for others manifesting at 
the level of relative truth and the two form kayas. 
The qualities that lead to fulfillment for oneself are related 
to the qualities of freedom and the qualities of value for others 
are related to the qualities of maturity. 
344 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
The qualities of freedom can be compared to the sun 
appearing from behind the clouds. An unobscured sun is free 
from clouds and not a creation of the clouds. Once the clouds 
have been removed, the sun becomes visible again. In the same 
way, the twofold wisdom of the Buddha is not the result of 
cognitive and emotional obscurations because once the wisdom 
is free from impurities, it manifests as full knowledge of the 
true nature and the variety of phenomena. 
The qualities of maturity begin when as a bodhisattva one 
gathers the accumulation of virtue and the accumulation of 
insight. Through the practice of these two accumulations all 
the various qualities mature which give rise to the form kayas 
that in turn give rise to the thirty-two qualities of maturity and 
thirty-two qualities of freedom of Buddhahood. 
242. The ground for acquiring fulfillment for oneself 
is the embodiment of the ultimate truth. 
The symbolic embodiments of the great sages 
are the ground for the greatest possible altruism. 
243. The first kaya is endowed with the qualities 
of freedom, powers and so forth, 
and the second with those of maturity, 
the marks of a perfect being. 
The ground for acquiring fulfillment for oneself is the ultimate 
kaya in which all thoughts have been eliminated 61 and all the 
good qualities of Buddhahood have been fully developed. If 
the ground were only a relative kaya, it would automatically be 
conditioned by impermanence; therefore it could not provide 
a reliable ground from which the qualities could manifest. The 
ultimate kaya, however, is unchanging so it can provide the 
best basis for fulfillment for oneself and others. It is said 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth ~jra Point 345 
therefore that the symbol kayas of the great sages are the ground 
of the greatest possible good for beings. "Great sages" is another 
name for the Buddhas. The phrase in Sanskrit is rishis meaning 
someone who is very straightforward, honest, and speaks only 
the truth. Non-Buddhists and arhats can also be called rishis 
but in this context it is used for the Buddhas. The phrase 
"symbol kayas" mean that the Buddhas express themselves in 
symbolic form at the level of relative reality. 
The first kaya, the dharmakaya, represents fulfillment for 
oneself. It has thirty-two qualities of freedom that include the 
ten powers, the four fearlessnesses and the eighteen distinctive 
qualities. These attributes are called qualities of freedom because 
the dharmakaya is free from all obscurations. 
The two form kayas manifest at the relative level of reality 
and are represented by the qualities of a perfect being. Th~ 
Buddha manifests in the form kayas in order to be visible to 
other beings and adopt the most perfect form that includes all 
thirty-two marks and eighty signs. These marks and signs are 
the fruition of all of the virtue that had been accumulated on 
the path when the Buddhas were bodhisattvas. 
The Thirty-Two Qualities of Freedom 
244. Counteracting ignorance's veils, the powers are like a 
vajra and fearlessness in any situation is like a lion. 
The '(athagata's distinctive qualities are like space 
and the two aspects which Victors manifest 
are like the moon in water. 
The qualities of freedom are compared to different things. The 
ten powers are compared to a vajra. A vajra cannot be destroyed 
or defeated by anything else and in the same way, the ten powers 
346 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
of the Buddha can defeat everything else by cutting through 
all ignorance. The four fearlessnesses of the Buddha are 
compared to a lion because a lion is naturally intrepid. A lion 
hasn't any fear because he knows he is the strongest animal in 
the forest and no other animal would even think of attacking 
him. In the same way the Buddha is not afraid of anything 
because he has seen the true nature of everything and cannot 
make a mistake. For this reason, he or she does not fear that 
someone will prove him wrong. The eighteen distinctive 
qualities of the Buddha are compared to space. One can mix 
the other elements such as earth and water, air and fire, but 
space cannot be mixed with any other element because it 
possesses characteristics that differ from any of the other 
elements. In the same way the attributes of the Buddha are 
distinctive. They do not resemble those of other beings. 
Finally, the two form kayas are compared to a reflection of 
the moon in water. The Buddha is the dharmakaya and he 
manifests spontaneously in the two form kayas in order to help 
other beings. In the same way, the moon reflecting in the water 
doesn't think, "I must shine on the water" and the reflection 
doesn't think, "I am here because the moon is shining." It is 
simply the presence of the moon in the sky and the presence of 
wa.ter on the ground that makes a reflection possible. In the 
same way, the two form kayas do not come about because the 
dharmakaya thinks, "I must manifest in the form kayas" nor 
do the form kayas think, "I am created by the dharmakaya." 
The Ten Powers 
245. To know the possible and the impossible, 
the full maturation of action, faculties, temperaments, 
wishes, the paths which determine each and every state, 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth ~jra Point 347 
246. meditative stability and so on -
that unblemished by defilement, 
memory of former states, divine vision and peace: 
these are the ten powers of perfect awareness. 
1. The first power that the Buddhas possess is the ability 
to perfecdy discriminate the possible and the impossible {or 
the appropriate from the inappropriate). When bodhisattvas 
make the commitment to reach enlightenment for the sake of 
all beings, they do not abandon this commitment. Ordinary 
beings, however, make promises that they may eventually break 
and perhaps later may decide to keep again. But the power that 
supports the knowledge that allows the Buddhas to determine 
what is appropriate becomes a very firm commitment that is 
never abandoned. It allows the Buddhas to identify the cause 
of any given situation or any action. The Buddhas know what 
should bring a particular effect and what is due to a certain 
cause. For instance, they know that every virtuous action will 
have a pleasant result and that every non-virtuous action will 
eventually result in a painful outcome. 
2. The second power of the Buddhas is the ability to 
foresee the eventual outcome of any action. This means that 
the Buddhas understand completely the way in which karma 
functions. This power comes from constant examination of the 
law of karma while practicing on the path and in the attempt 
to help others understand karma. For example, an arhat would 
not know the cause of the blue and yellow color on a peacock's 
feather, but the Buddha would know exactly what action gave 
rise to that particular effect. 
3. The third power is the ability to determine exacdy how 
intelligent individual beings are. This power is the culmination 
of the bodhisattva's activity to help others while on the path. 
On the path, bodhisattvas teach persons according to their level 
348 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
of understanding. They can see that some are very diligent while 
others are not. Some are very intelligent and others not. 
Accordingly, bodhisattvas give teachings that are appropriate 
for students at their particular level. 
4. The fourth power is the ability to know the various 
temperaments of beings. The bodhisattvas on the path 
understand the different dispositions and temperaments of 
beings. They see that some are influenced mostly by anger, so 
they teach them the remedy for anger. Others have a major 
problem with desire, so they teach those beings the remedy for 
desire. Still others are mostly obscured by ignorance. Some have 
too many thoughts and they receive yet another remedy. When 
bodhisattvas reach Buddhahood, they then have developed the 
full understanding of the various temperaments of beings. 
5. The fifth power is the ability to determine the interests 
of beings. The bodhisattvas discover that some persons are 
attracted to the Hinayana and others are more interested in 
the Mahayana. They find that some are attracted to the practice 
of generosity, while others prefer to practice discipline. Still 
others prefer meditation. Since they know exactly what each 
being prefers to practice, when they become Buddhas they have 
developed a complete understanding of the wishes and interests 
of ;ill beings. 
6. The sixth power is the knowledge of the path that leads 
everywhere. On the path as a bodhisattva they become familiar 
with all of the levels of practice of all of the vehicles. As a result 
they can determine which of the various paths lead to the 
different states of samsara and nirvana. They can see the path 
that leads to less suffering, the path that leads to immediate 
happiness and the path of eternal happiness. This familiarity 
with all vehicles on the path develops into the Buddha's 
knowledge of the path that goes everywhere. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Vajra Point 349 
7. The seventh power is the knowledge of meditative 
stability that is completely pure. The Buddhas know which 
form of meditation is authentic and which is false. While they 
practice on the path, they emphasize meditation and in this 
way discover which forms of meditation produce the correct 
results. They also discover which mistakes can arise and how to 
eliminate these mistakes. 
8. The eighth power is the ability to remember former 
states. The Buddhas can remember clearly all their former 
samsaric births, not one or two lifetimes, but all of their births 
since the beginning of samsara. This is a power that develops 
out of their practice on the path. They take every opportunity 
to practice virtue no matter how small, and as a result develop 
the power to remember former ~tates. 
9. The ninth power is divine vision. The Buddhas can see 
what is going to happen to beings in the future. They can see 
which birth a person is going to take, and the state in which 
they will find themselves. This power develops through the 
practice of great compassion while caring for beings while 
practicing on the path. 
10. The tenth power is the ability to determine whether 
or not all impurities have been eliminated. If someone were 
to think that they ·could make this determination before they 
reach Buddhahood, it would be only an illusion because it is 
impossible for anyone except a Buddha to have eliminated all 
impurities and to know this with certainty. The arhats have 
only attained partial freedom from impurities. This power is 
gained on the path by teaching others how to exhaust all 
impurities. The bodhisattvas themselves exhaust their impurities 
by practicing meditation. 
247. Such powers -the appropriate and inappropriate, 
full maturation, temperaments, beings' aspirations, 
350 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
their various paths, the defiled and the perfectly pure, 
the groupings of faculties, remembrance of former states, 
divine vision and the way to exhaust impurity -
are like a vajra because they penetrate the armor 
of ignorance, 
shatter its walls, and fell its tree. 
These ten qualities are called powers because they're extremely 
efficacious. They are compared to three analogies. They're 
compared to a vajra that can pierce armor, destroy walls and 
fell the trees of ignorance. Ignorance~ representing three kinds 
of obscurations, is compared to armor, a solid wall and to a 
very thick forest. 
The Four Fearlessnesses 
248. In everything being perfectly enlightened, 
in bringing 
a definitive end to obstacles, 
in teaching the path and in stating cessation, 
they have four kinds of fearlessness. 
The Buddhas manifest four forms of fearlessness. 
1. First, the Buddhas are fearless because they can say that 
they have reached perfect purification with nothing more to 
purify. They can say they have perfect knowledge without any 
fear of contradiction because they know everything without 
exception. This fearlessness developed out of the willingness to 
give teaching to whoever wanted them, expressing the same 
loving consideration for all beings. 
2. The second fearlessness is related to the way they teach 
others. The Buddhas have no fear that they may be contradicted. 
The Qualities o[Buddhahood- The Sixth Vajra Point 351 
No one could ever prove the Buddhas to be wrong when they 
show the obstacles on the path. 
3. The third fearlessness is that the Buddhas put into 
practice the removal of impurities through the five stages of 
the path of practice and the complete thirty-seven factors of 
enlightenment.62 The Buddhas are perfectly sure that the path 
can lead to enlightenment. They are not worried that anyone 
might contradict them because they know that the path 
being taught is the path that is complete and can provide 
complete enlightenment. 
The second and third forms of fearlessness develop direcdy 
out of the relationship with other beings. They" are acquired on 
the path before the Buddhas actually became enlightened. As 
they practice, the-bodhisattvas strive to behave virtuously in every 
possible way and continuously eliminate even very small 
impurities. As a result they develop the two kinds of fearlessnesses: 
the ability to relinquish obscurations and the ability to guide 
themselves on the correct path to enlightenment. 
4. The fourth fearlessness is related to the development of 
the Buddhas themselves. The Buddhas can state that they have 
overcome all impurities with no fear that anyone will contradict 
them because as they practiced and taught, they never allowed 
pride to mislead them. 
249. Because they themselves know and help others know 
every aspect of that which is to be known, 
becatfie they have eliminated and help others eliminate 
those things which must be eliminated, 
because they teach and aid others to teach and 
because ihey have attained and help others to attain 
the utterly stainless highest attainment, 
they truthfully tell others of their own realization 
and, in so doing, are unhindered in any way. 
352 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
250. just as, in every part of the jungle, 
the king of wild animals is evtr fearless, 
moving intrepidly among all other beasts, 
so likewise is the 'lion, ' the king ofVictors, 
ever completely fearless, in any gathering: 
independent, stable and highly skillful. 
What is the purpose or function of the four forms of 
fearlessnesses? 
~ The first function of the four types of fearlessness is to 
raise every one to the level of knowledge the Buddhas themselves 
enjoy. 
~ The second function is to help other beings do the same. 
~ Third, the Buddhas have achieved their goal of 
unsurpassable and perfect enlightenment and help others to 
do likewise. 
~ Fourth, they tell others truthfully the meaning of what 
they themselves have realized because great sages are not 
hindered when they present their teachings. 
The four types of fearlessness can be described in an example 
of a lion. A lion in the forest is never afraid because he knows 
that he is the strongest animal and therefore is never afraid to 
encounter other wild animals. In the same way, wherever or 
among whatever kinds of beings the Buddha finds himself, he 
will always remain fearless. His ability to teach will always 
remain the same because he will never have any doubts about 
what he teaches. He knows that he teaches the truth. Also he 
will never be distracted by the fear that he will lose disciples or 
the hope that he will gain others. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Vttjra Point 353 
The Eighteen Distinctive Qualities 
251. Buddhas are never mistaken and do not chatter noisily 
Their mindfulness is impeccable and their mind 
is never not in meditative equipoise. 
They do not harbor ideas of various kinds. 
The eighteen qualities of the Buddhas are divided into three 
groups: 
• those qualities related to behavior, 
• those related to understanding, and 
• those related to activity. 
The first six qualities are concerned with the Buddha's physical 
behavior. 
1. Whenever the Buddhas engage in an activity, it is 
completely free of mistakes. Most of the time the behavior of 
the arhats is impeccable, but they do occasionally make 
mistakes. So for this reason the ability to behave correctly in 
every situation is a quality that belongs only to the Buddhas. 
2. The second quality is related to the speech of the Buddhas 
who do not speak in a meaningless or useless way. 
3. The third quality is related to the mind of the Buddhas 
whose mindfulness never decreases. 63 Ordinary beings and even 
arhats will be distracted from time to time, but it is totally 
impossible for the Buddhas to ever forget anything. 
4. The fourth quality is related to the Buddha's mind, which 
always rf~ts in meditation. 
5. The Buddhas never think of deceiving others. This is . ") 
the fifth quality. They always have a loving disposition, a very 
truthful disposition, without being encumbered by 
uncompassionate thoughts. 
354 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
6. The sixth quality of Buddhas is that they never act casually 
without first examining their behavior carefully. Their behavior 
is never frivolous. 
252. Never is their indifference something unaware and 
their mighty aspiration is never subject to degradation; 
nor is their diligence, their memory, their prajna, 
their perfect liberation and perception: 
the jnana of liberation. 
The next six qualities are qualities of realization. 
7. The seventh quality is the aspiration to benefit beings. 
This aspiration never degenerates. 
8. In the same way the diligence of the Buddhas never 
degenerates. 
9. Their memory never fails 
10. There is never any degradation of their understanding. 
11. There is never any change in their perfect liberation, it 
is continuous. 
12. They never lose their perception of perfect jnana; their 
wisdom never fails. 
253. Their activities are preceded by jnana and this jnana 
is not prone to any deterioration with time. 
These eighteen qualities and others 
are those teachers' attributes alone. 
The third group of qualities describes the activity of the 
Buddhas. These are again subdivided into 
~ three distinctive qualities that characterize their 
activities and 
~ three distinctive qualities that characterize their jnana. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Vajra Point 355 
13. Buddha activity means that whenever Buddhas act, their 
physical actions are preceded by, accompanied by and followed 
by jnana. 
14. Likewise, their speech, and 
15. their thoughts are also preceded and followed by jnana. 
The activities of the Buddhas are carried out with great care 
and are always preceded by a precise examination of the relevant 
situation. Before they act, they see the outcome with their jnana 
and act accordingly. After the action has been accomplished, 
the Buddhas will examine it in the light of their jnana to ensure 
that it was properly completed. 
The three qualities that describe the jnana are: 
16. this jnana is unhindered by the past. 
17. It is unhindered by the present, and 
18. in the say way unhindered by the future. 
This means that their practice is unhindered by any 
emotional or cognitive obscurations. It is completely free and 
fluid and can know everything without hindrance. 
The Function of the Eighteen Qualities 
254. For great sages there are no mistakes, chatter, 
unmindfulness, mental agitation, various forms of 
ideationor casual indifference. 
Aspiration, diligence, recollection, perfictly pure and 
immq(ulate prajna, constant, perfict liberation 
and jnana of perfict liberation, 
which is aware of all aspects of the knowable -
these are-theirs and these never suffer from any deterioration. 
255. All three activities, whatever they may be 
are preceded by, accompanied by and followed by jnana. 
356 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Their perfect awareness constantly and extensively 
penetrates the three times without hindrance. 
These having been made real, the Buddhas, 
the Victorious Ones with compassion's magnificence, 
achieve a perfect and fearless turning 
of the great wheel of true dharma for beings. 
These two verses give a concise list of the eighteen qualities. 
The behavior of the Buddhas is described by six qualities: they 
do not make mistakes, they do not engage in idle talk nor do 
they forget. They do not suffer from mental agitation, or 
random thoughts and their activity is always from a deliberation 
of their wisdom. There are six qualities of the Buddha's 
realization: no decrease in their aspiration, diligence, memory, 
perfectly pure prajna, perfect liberation and the ability to know 
everything that can be known. Three qualities describe the 
activities of the Buddhas (their actions of body, speech and 
mind are accompanied by and followed by jnana), and three 
pertain to their jnana (their jnana is unhindered by the past, 
present or future). 
The Buddhas have realization of these eighteen qualities 
that makes it possible for them to turn the wheel of dharma, 
have great compassion and to overcome all defilements. Because 
they possess these eighteen qualities they can perfectly and 
fearlessly turn the wheel of dharma. 
256. Earth and so forth have properties of specific character; 
their nature is not that of space. 
The intrinsic character of space, non-obstruction 
is absent in matter. 
Earth, water, fire, wind and space 
are equally common to all of the worlds 
but not even so much as an atom 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth ~jra Point 357 
of the distinctive attributes of a Buddha 
is common to any of the worlds. 
These eighteen qualities are compared to space. The elements 
of earth, water, fire and wind have their own characteristics. 
Earth is solid, water fluid, wind moving, and fire hot and 
burning. These qualities of the elements are unlike those of 
space because space is the container in which everything else 
takes place. In the same way, 'only the Buddha possesses the 
eighteen distinctive qualities. Ordinary beings do not possess 
the special distinctive qualities anymore than the Buddhas 
possess the faults of ordinary beings. 
The Thirty-Two Qualities of Maturity 
The qualities of maturity are expressed by the thirty-two marks 
of the Buddha. They are called the beautiful marks or marks of 
excellence because they are the special attributes of 
Buddhahood. They .are also called the qualities of maturity 
because the qualities develop as the result of the long process 
of gathering virtue practicing the path. 64 
257. Perfectly level and marked with wheels, 
his feet are broad and his ankles are not protruding. 
Long are his fingers and his toes, webbed. 
1. The first mark is that the Buddha's feet are perfectly level 
and bear the mark of a thousand-spoked wheel (Skt. 
dharmachakra). This signifies that while the Buddha was on 
the path he had taken and observed the vows properly, had 
respected his teachers, and had gathered a great deal of virtue. 
358 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
2. His feet are very wide and his ankles are not visible. This 
indicates that he has practiced to a high degree all the aspects 
of virtue. 
3. His fingers and toes are long. This signifies that the 
Buddha, while on the path, protected beings that were about 
to be killed and saved them from death. 
4. The digits of his hands and feet are connected by a web 
signifying that whenever the Buddha encountered a conflict, 
he tried to bring the conflicting parties together. 
258. Soft is his skin and fine his youthful flesh, 
his body having seven elevated parts. 
Like an antelope's are his calves 
and like an elephant's are his private parts recessed. 
5. His skin is very so& and smooth like a youth, which is 
the sign that while on the path the Buddha gave many clothes 
and food away to other people. 
6. His body has seven elevated parts corresponding to the 
two tops of the feet, the tops of the hands, the shoulders, and 
the back of the neck. So there are seven parts that are nicely 
rounded and elevated which came from having given food and 
drink to other beings while practicing the path. 
7. His calves are like those of an antelope meaning that 
they are very strong, solid, and muscular signifying that during 
the path he learned all the aspects of the five branches of 
Buddhist knowledge. 
8. His private parts are sunk into recesses as an elephant's 
signifying that the Buddha always kept a person's secrets and 
did not tell them to others. 
259. His torso is like a lion's 
and his clavicles not hollow but well-filled. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Vajra Point 359 
His shoulders are elegantly rounded; 
rounded, soft and even are his arms. 
9. His torso is like that of a lion meaning it is very majestic 
and wide. This signifies that the Buddha nurtured others with 
great care and concern and that he practiced virtue himself 
with great perseverance. 
10. His clavicle is not hollow, but filled in with flesh with 
no spaces in between the two bones. This signifies that on the 
path the Buddha was very generous. He was particularly 
generous to the sick providing them with medicine. 
11. The tops of his shoulders are nicely rounded signifying 
that on the path the Buddha used proper speech by only 
speaking appropriately and kindly and protected others from 
fear. 
12. His arms are soft, round, and very smooth and even. 
This signifies that on the path the Buddha was always a friend 
for others caring for them as diligently as possible. 
260. His arms are long and his perfectly pure body 
is surrounded by an aura of light. 
His neck, like a conch, is rounded and without blemish 
and his cheeks are like those of the king of beasts. 
13. His arms are very long, falling to the level of his knees 
indicating that on the path whenever someone m:,tde a request 
that pers<;m's expectations were always completely fulfilled. 
14. The Buddha's body is perfectly pure and surrounded 
by a bright aura indicating that on the path the Buddha made 
relentless efforts to practice the ten virtues. 
15. On his neck are three lines that create a design that 
looks like a conch shell. This design signifies that the Buddha 
possesses the ability to teach the 84,000 aspects of the dharma. 
360 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
This also represents the fact that on the path the Buddha always 
served the sick and nursed them and gave them medicine. 
16. The cheeks of the Buddha are like those of a king of 
beasts (lion) indicating that the Buddha did not engage in 
useless speech but always endeavored to lead other beings to 
practice what was good and wholesome. 
261. Equal are his forty teeth. They are very pure, closely set, 
immaculate and evenly aligned; 
the eye-teeth are perfect and excellently white. 
17. The Buddha has forty teeth with twenty in the upper 
and twenty on the lower jaw. This indicates that on the path 
the Buddha expressed the same attitude towards all beings 
because all beings were once our parents. The Buddha treated 
all with equal· kindness with never a harsh word for anyone. 
The same number of teeth in each jaw symbolizes this sameness 
of attitude. 
18. The Buddha's teeth are perfectly clean and beautifully 
aligned signifying that the Buddha always created harmony and 
that the Buddha always speaks the truth. 
19. The Buddha's teeth are completely immaculate and 
c;:ven, not one of his teeth is longer than others. This signifies 
that while on the path, the Buddha gave away his possessions 
and made his living honestly, without deceit. 
20. The canine teeth of the Buddha are perfectly and 
completely white indicating that on the path all his or her 
physical, verbal, and mental actions were perfectly honest and 
straightforward. 
262. His tongue is long, unending and inconceivable, 
possessing the most perfect faculty of taste. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Wtjra Point 361 
The spontaneously born has a voice 
like the song of the kalavinka bird or like Bhramas melody. 
21. The Buddha's tongue is long, endless and inconceivable 
indicating that the Buddha has the ability to teach the most 
profound form of the dharma. This particular mark is the sign 
that on the path the Buddha spoke softly, never using coarse 
language. 
22. The Buddha has a perfect faculty of taste, meaning that 
whenever his tongue touches food, a most exquisite taste results. 
This is because the Buddha always gave those who were in need 
remedies that were both agreeable and beneficial. 
23. The Buddha has a voice as sweet as the kalavinka bird, 
a bird that sings a beautiful song. This is because as he 
practiced the Buddha always spoke in a very soft, smooth 
voice. Also, he always spoke the truth, discussing what was 
relevant and pleasant. 
263. The supreme of beings has beautiful eyes, 
like blue lotuses, 
and like an ox's are his eyelashes. 
With its immaculate white treasure-hair, 
his face is handsome to behold. 
His head bears a mound 
and his skin is pure, fine and golden. 
24. The Buddha's eyes are pale and delicate like blue lotuses. 
His eyes are so beautiful because while on the path the Buddha 
treated people as though they were his only sons. Just as a 
mother has the greatest love for her only son, the Buddha has 
cherished each being. 
25. The Buddha's eyelashes are as handsome as those of an 
ox meaning they are very long and nicely separated. This 
362 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
signifies the Buddha never allowed himself to become angry or 
behave hypocritically. 
26. The Buddha's face is very clear, white, and beautiful. 
As he practiced the Buddha always demonstrated the greatest 
respect for special beings such as other bodhisattvas and always 
praised them reverently. He also has an.immaculate white urna 
hair, which is a very fine hair between his eyebrows. 
27. The Buddha has a ushnisha on his head, the top of 
which cannot be seen. 65 This indicates that on the path, the 
Buddha had great reverence for his guru as well as other teachers 
and bodhisattvas. It is a literal indication that he carries other 
bodhisattvas on his head, which is a sign of greatest respect. 
28. The skin of the Buddha is pure and fine. This indicates 
that on the path he always strove to practice virtue because his 
mind was completely manageable. 
29. His skin is the color of gold which is the sign that he 
served the Buddhas and made offerings to them in every possible 
way. 
264. The hairs on his body are exceedingly fine and soft, 
one from each (pore) and curling to the right and to the top. 
His hair is impeccable and like a deep-blue gem. 
As well-rounded as a perfect nyagrodha tree 
30. The hairs of the Buddha's body are very soft and fine, 
each growing from a single pore, curling to the right and towards 
the Buddha's crown. This signifies the great manageability of 
his mind and his great efforts in the practice of virtue during 
the path. 
31. The Buddha's hair is impeccable and has a slightly bluish 
tinge like a deep blue jewel. This signifies the Buddha was always 
very kind and loving. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Vajra Point 363 
32. The Buddha's body is perfectly proportioned and is 
compared to the roundness of a nyagrodha tree. This shows 
that the Buddha practiced meditation in many different places 
and led other beings onto the path of meditation. 
265. the ever-good and incomparable great sage has the 
strength of Narayana in his firm body. 
These two and thirty marks, 
vividly brilliant and beyond any concept's grasp 
are taught by our Teacher as those of a lord of men. 
Finally, it is said that the Buddha has a firm body and the 
strength ofNarayana, 66 which is a general quality of his whole 
body and not simply a mark. This signifies the great respect 
that the Buddha always showed to other Buddhas and 
bodhisattvas on the path and the praises that he offered them. 
Example of the Qualities 
266. just as the form of the autumn moon in a cloudless sky 
is seen in the azure waters of a lake, 
so also are the form kaya of the All-Embracing 
seen by the Victors' Sons in the perfect Buddha mandala. 
The form of the Buddhas is compared to the autumn moon 
in a cloudless sky. This example has been used before in 
connection with the form kayas. Here the pure disciples of 
the bodhisattvas are compared to a lake of pure water. The 
reflection of the moon in pure water is very clear reflecting 
all of the qualities of the moon. In this way, the bodhisattvas 
can see the Buddhas directly in their mandala. In that way 
they see the sambhogakaya body with all the marks and signs 
364 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
of perfection. However, ordinary beings and shravakas do not 
see this sambhogakaya emanation. 
Scriptural Source 
267. One should know that these sixty-four qualities 
and their respective causes here follow their order 
in the Jewel Discourse'- the Ratna Sutra. 
These sixty-four qualities (ten powers, four fearlessnesses, 
eighteen qualities and thirty-two marks) are explained in this 
same order in the jewel Sutra (Ratnadarika-sutra). 
Recapitulation of the Examples 
268. Being invulnerable, undisheartened, 
peerless and unmoving, 
they are illustrated by the examples of a vajra, a lion, 
space and the clear moon in water. 
There are four sets of the qualities of the Buddha. 
0 First there are the ten powers of the Buddha that are 
called powers because they can defeat and destroy all 
obscurations. They cannot be harmed by this negativity. These 
powers are compared to a vajra because a vajra is made of a 
substance that has the power to destroy anything else and cannot 
be harmed at all. 
0 The second set of qualities is the four forms of 
fearlessnesses. The Buddha is fearless; he never becomes 
discouraged or afraid that he cannot understand something. 
This power is compared to a lion because a lion is never afraid 
of other animals. In the same way, the Buddhas never experience 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth ~jra Point 365 
doubt or think, "Will I know this?" or "Maybe I will make a 
mistake." 
0 The third set consists of the eighteen distinctive 
attributes of the Buddha which are compared to space. These 
qualities belong to the Buddha and no one else. In the same 
way, space has few qualities in common w;it:h the other elements. 
0 The fourth set of qualities represents the two form kayas 
and the thirty-two marks of the Buddha and these are compared 
to the reflection of the moon in water. When the moon is in 
the sky, it doesn't think, "I will reflect in the water." In the 
same way, Buddha activity occurs when the time is ripe and 
manifests spontaneously without any conscious thought. 
Examples of the Qualities 
269. Of these, the six, three and one powers 
have completely dispelled, respectively, 
what is cognitive, meditative balance and those 
accompanied by latent conditioning. 
A vajra as a symbol of the ten powers. The ten powers are divided 
into three groups. 
0 The first six powers are represented by a vajra because 
they vanquish cognitive obscurations. These powers are the 
knowledge of what is appropriate, full fruition of activity, degree 
of intelligence, different temperaments, different wishes, and 
the path that leads everywhere. 
0 The next three powers destroy meditative obscurations. 
These ar~ the power of meditative stability, the ability to 
remember former lives, and divine vision. These three resemble 
a vajra because they destroy the hindrances to meditative 
equilibrium. 
366 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Ct Finally, the last power destroys the subtle subconscious 
traces left behind. This last power is the one that enables the 
Buddha to determine that all defilements have been totally 
pacified. 
270. Thus they have pierced, destroyed and felled 
those which are like armor, walls, and trees. 
Being firm, enduring, steadfast and invulnerable, 
these powers of the sages vajra-like. 
271. Why firm? Because they are enduring. 
Why enduring? Because they are steadfast. 
Why steadfast? Because they are invulnerable. 
Why invulnerable? Because they are like a vajra. 
The obscurations are also represented by an example. The 
cognitive obscuration is compared to thick armor that is pierced 
by the vajra of the Buddha's first six powers. The meditative 
obscurations are compared to a thick wall that is destroyed by 
the next three powers of the Buddha. The subconscious traces 
are compared to a tree that is felled by the last power of the 
Buddha. It is said that the powers of the great sage, the Buddha, 
are like a vajra because they are firm, enduring, steadfast and 
invulnerable. They are firm because they have the quality of 
changelessness because once these powers manifest they are like 
the strong essence of phenomena. They are steadfast in that 
they are not subject to change. They are adamantine like a vajra. 
272. Being fearless, unconcerned and stable, 
and possessing skill supreme, the lion of humans, 
the triumphant one, is likened to a lion because 
he is fearless in the midst of ar,zy gathering. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Vajra Point 367 
273. Having definite knowledge of everything, 
the Enlightened remain absolutely fearless of anyone. 
Seeing clearly that even purified beings 
are not their peers, they remain uninfluenced. 
274. Since their noble mind is constantly attentive, 
to each and every phenomenon, it has stability. 
Having transcended the state of latent ignorance, 
so difficult to transcend, they possess skillfol mastery. 
The lion as an example of enlightened fearlessness. The second set 
of qualities of the Buddha is related to fearlessness. The Buddha 
is compared to a lion because a lion is fearless, unconcerned, 
stable, and has supreme skill. 
0 A lion is fearless in the midst of a group of other animals 
and the Buddha is fearless in the midst of a gathering of people. 
When the Buddha teaches, he is never afraid that his teaching 
will not explain the path adequately or present the genuine 
path because he knows that this path is complete and that it 
leads to Buddhahood. A lion is fearless when it is surrounded 
by a group of other animals because it is stronger than any of 
them. Likewise, the Buddha is fearless because he has direct 
knowledge of all phenomena. 
0 The lion is unconcerned and self-reliant because it 
doesn't need to be protected. In the same way, the Buddha is 
independent because he doesn't need to fear that anyone might 
defeat him. 
I 
0 Thirdly, the powers of the lion are stable because its 
strength is always present. In the same way, the pure mind of 
the Buddha is perfectly clear and stable at all times and it is 
cognizant of all phenomena. The Buddha never experiences 
impurities, for this reason, his qualities are always stable. 
368 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
0 The fourth feature that the Buddha and the lion have 
in common is supreme skill. The lion has physical skill that 
never diminishes. For this reason he is never afraid. In the same 
way, the Buddha has completely transcended all ignorance. For 
this reason, he need never fear that he will lose his power. 
275. Worldlings, shravakas, those one-sided, 
the wise and the spontaneously arising, 
have progressively subtler understanding, 
as exemplified by the elements five. 
276. Buddhas are like earth, water, fire and wind, 
being sustenance for all the worlds. 
They are like space, being beyond the characteristics 
of both worldly existence and that which transcends it. 
Space as an example of the distinctive qualities. The eighteen 
distinctive qualities of the Buddha are compared to space and 
the five paths of enlightenment can be compared to the five 
elements. One may divide beings into five different kinds. 
0 The first group, ordinary beings, are completely under 
the power of illusion and delusion. 
0 The shravakas have more understanding. Their minds 
are already clearer because they attempt to understand the non­
existence of a personal self. 
0 The pratyekabuddhas have experienced further 
development than that of the shravakas because they understand 
the non-existence of outer objects, but do not understand the 
non-existence of the perceiving mind. 
0 The bodhisattvas who understand the non-existence of 
both the personal self and outer phenomena have developed 
even further, but they have not completely mastered the 
understanding that they have begun to experience. 
The Qualities of Buddhahood- The Sixth Vajra Point 369 
$ Finally, the Buddhas who possess full, complete 
understanding of both aspects of existence are the most 
developed category of beings. 
The mind of ordinary beings is com pared to the earth 
element which is very dense. The water element is less dense or 
lighter than earth. The shravakas are compared to this element. 
The element of fire is even less dense and pra,tyekabuddhas are 
compared to this element. The air element is still less dense 
and corresponds to the bodhisattvas. Finally, the element of 
space is compared to the eighteen distinctive qualities of the 
Buddhas. The Buddha is further compared to all the elements 
combined. The earth gives the world its solidity, water its 
fluidity, fire its warmth and air its movement. The Buddhas 
provide the basis for all qualities. The Buddhas are also like 
space in that they transcend all of the characteristics of the 
world and whatever is beyond. This means they transcend any 
comparison with ordinary beings, bodhisattvas, etc. 
277. Thus as two and thirty qualities are fashioned 
these aspects of dharmakaya. 
Even so, they are as inseparable 
as the color, brilliance and shape of a gem. 
278. These attributes which, when seen, 
inspire contentment, 
are known as the 'two and thirty'founded in kayas two: 
nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya 
which makes dharma perfect. 
279. Those further from purity and those closer 
see these in two ways: 
as being in the world or as the mandala of the Victors, 
like the form of the moon, beheld in water or in space. 
370 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
These thirty-two qualities (the powers, fearlessnesses and 
qualities) appear different but are actually indivisible from one 
another and simply represent different facets of the same 
phenomena. This inseparability is compared to a jewel -one 
cannot actually separate the color, the brilliance or the shapes 
seen in a jewel from each other because they are completely 
inseparable from the actual jewel. In the same way, these thirty­
two qualities of the Buddha are inseparable from the dharmakaya. 
The thirty-two qualities of maturity bring contentment, 
happiness, and joy. These thirty-two marks are expressed in 
the two form kayas; The nirmanakaya and the sambhogakaya 
represent the perfect expression of the Mahayana dharma. The 
minds of ordinary beings are far from pure. Impurities prevent 
them from seeing the form kayas. The shravakas see the form 
kayas as the nirmanakaya. Those who are close to purity, the 
bodhisattvas, see the form kayas as the sambhogakaya. The pure 
ones are compared in the example to those who see the moon 
directly in the sky and those who are impure to those who see 
the moon reflected in the water. 
This was the third chapter, on "Qualities" from the Analysis 
of the Potential for the Rare and Supreme in this Ultimate 
Mahayana Treatise on the Changeless Continuity of the True 
Nature. 
BUDDHA ACTIVITY 
Tbe Seventh Vajra Point 
Its Spontaneity 371 
280. Ever spontaneous are the All-embracing One's actions, 
regarding the temperaments of those to be trained, 
the means for training them, 
the trainings suited to their dispositions 
and their own movements in terms of time and space. 
THIS CHAPTER is divided into two main points: 
~ Buddha activity is spontaneous, it that happens 
naturally-without any effort, and 
~ Buddha activity is unceasing, it is continuous. 
The Buddhas always act spontaneously. The Buddhas know 
the various temperaments of beings, their various dispositions, 
their dominant tendencies, and their aspirations. By 
understanding the temperaments of beings the Buddhas are 
able to determine how to educate them. Some people are helped 
372 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
best by showing them an example of a certain type of behavior. 
For example, if they see the peaceful and very controlled 
behavior of a Buddha, they will develop a great feeling of faith. 
This will lead them to the dharma. Others respond to miracles, 
for this reason, the Buddhas will show them miracles. Some 
simply respond to teachings. The Buddhas will just give 
teachings to those beings. The Buddhas also know that some 
beings are ready to practice at higher levels and others are ready 
for total liberation. They place these beings on the path that 
corresponds to their level of ability and aspiration. 
The Buddhas know precisely which time and the place that 
requires their activity without any thought and they act 
effortlessly at the correct moment in a manner that is perfectly 
appropriate to the needs of the varieties of beings. 
Its Ceaselessness 
281. Endowed with a jnana ocean, 
filled with a multitude of gem-like qualities 
and with the sunlight of virtue and jnana, 
the Buddhas have achieved all yanas. 
Without middle or end, exceedingly vast, 
Buddhahood is all-pervading, like space. 
Perfectly seeing that this treasure of unsullied qualities 
is in every being, without the slightest variation, 
the wind of their perfect compassion dispels 
the complex cloud banks of defilements and false knowledge. 
Buddha activity is unceasing. The qualities of the Buddhas are 
the sum of all the good qualities of meditation. The various 
paths of the Buddhas are like an ocean containing many jewels. 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh ~jra Point 373 
The Buddhas are also compared to the sun. They have 
completed the two accumulations of virtue and insight and 
these accumulations are compared to the sun because vegetables, 
grass, trees and everything else needs sunlight to grow. In the 
same way, with the ,perfect sunlight of the Buddhas' 
accumulations all beings can be brought to spiritual maturity. 
Finally, the Buddhas are compared to space because they are 
without beginning, middle, or end. Their wisdom is deep and 
vast because they have achieved the fruition of all the yanas. 
The Buddhas are Buddhas because they possess the 
following three abilities. 
~ Buddhas can see the seed of Buddhahood in the mind 
of all beings, 
~ they can see that it makes no difference whether beings 
are presently in a higher or a lower state of existence, and 
~ they see that there is no fundamental difference between 
someone who is practicing the path and someone who is not. 
The seed is within all beings without exception. This 
treasure is presently hidden by impurities, but the Buddhas 
know how to remove the impurities that cover it. The clouds 
of obscurations can be removed by the great compassion of the 
Buddhas that is similar to a wind blowing away all the clouds 
from the sun. In more detail: 
Its Spontaneity 
282. Since thoughts ofJor whom,' 'by what means,' 
'through which training,' 'where' or when' do not arise, 
these masters of wisdom are spontaneous at all times. 
283. Jor whom'- the temperaments of those to be trained, 
'by what means' -which of the many training methods, 
374 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
'through which training, '-which actions to use to train 
them or 'where' or 'when'-on which occasion. 
The activity of the Buddhas is spontaneous because they possess 
a perfect knowledge of the variety of phenomena. They do not 
need to consider, "For whom am I doing this?" or "What way 
should I do this?" because they automatically know for whom 
and by what means they are going to act. Through the 
knowledge of how things are, they understand that everything 
is non-existent, unborn and has no actual reality. For this reason, 
when they act, their activity is not constrained by confusion or 
the distinction between what is real and what is unreal. Knowing 
true emptiness, they know precisely how to act. In this way 
Buddha activity is spontaneous and devoid of any thought. At 
the same time, it corresponds exactly to the needs of the beings 
that they teach. 
Its Ceaselessness 
284. Buddha activity is unceasing, being devoid of concept 
regarding true freedom, freedom's support, 
the result of freedom, 
authentic possession of that result, 
the obscurations which veil it, 
and the necessary conditions for breaking through them. 
There are six points that describe the unceasing activity of the 
Buddha: 
~ True freedom. The release or the definite freedom from 
samsara. 
~ Freedom's support. Attaining freedom through the two 
accumulations. 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh ~jra Point 375 
~ The result of .freedom. The fruition of this freedom which 
is the achievement of Buddhahood. 
~ Authentic possession of that result. All beings can achieve 
this fruition. 
~ The obscurations which veil it. All beings have Buddha­
essence, but they cannot see it because it is veiled by the 
obscurations. 
~ The necessary condition for breaking through them. The 
removal of these obscurations. 
In more detail: 
285. Genuine release is the ten levels, 
its cause is the two accumulations, 
its result is supreme enlightenment 
an enlightenment which beings truly possess. 
286. Its obscuring veils are the endless defilements, 
subsidiary defilements and latent tendencies. 
Great compassion is the condition for destroying these. 
0 The first point is that through Buddha activity the 
Buddhas help all beings enter the path that releases them from 
samsara. Through Buddha activity a being will reach the first 
bodhisattva level, then the second, and so on until they 
transcend samsara. 
$ Secondly, freedom is attained by entering the 
bodhisattva path and practicing the two accumulations of virtue 
and insight. 
0 Thirdly, the fruition of beings established in the various 
bodhisattva levels is Buddhahood. 
0 Fourthly, when beings try to progress through the 
various bodhisattva levels, they encounter cognitive and 
376 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
emotional obscurations and the subconscious imprints left by 
karma. 
$ Fifthly, all obscurations have been removed when 
enlightenment is achieved. 
0 Sixthly, the great compassion of the Buddhas provides 
all the necessary conditions for destroying these obscurations. 
287. These six points should be known as being respectively 
like an ocean, the sun, space, a treasure, 
clouds and the wind. 
These six points are illustrated by six similes. The three freedoms 
achieved with the mastery of the ten bodhisattva levels are 
illustrated by an example of the ocean. The practice of the two 
accumulations is represented by an example ofthe sun. The 
achievement of Buddhahood is represented by space and all 
beings that can achieve this are compared to a treasure. And 
clouds symbolize the various obscurations. 
288. The levels are like an ocean ofjnana waters. 
Possessing the qualities of its ocean's gems. 
The two accumulations are like the sun, 
since by them all beings are sustained. 
289. Enlightenment is like space, 
being vast, centerless and without end. 
The core character of beings is like a treasure, 
being the very nature of utterly pure enlightenment. 
290. The covering defilements are like hosts of clouds, 
being transient, pervasive and not entities. 
Compassion is like a mighty wind, 
being ever-present to dispel them. 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh 'l&jra Point 377 
The reasons for using these similes are as follows. An ocean 
symbolizes the ten levels of the bodhisattva path because as 
beings enter the successive levels of the bodhisattva path, they 
are endowed with a great number of qualities that are like 
precious jewels. The state of a bodhisattva on the tenth level is 
compared to a great ocean because the ocean contains many 
fabulous jewels which are compared to the qualities of 
meditation, the powers of perfect memory, intuitive cognition, 
and the like, which are possessed by a bodhisattva at this level. 
The sun symbolizes the two accumulations because if there 
were no sun, there would be no warmth and nothing would 
grow; so the conditions for life would be absent. In the same 
way, the two accumulations are like the sun in that they are the 
two vital factors needed to attain liberation. 
Thirdly, enlightenment is compared to space because it has 
no beginning, center, or end, one cannot say that space is this 
or that because space has no solid existence. Buddhahood is 
similar in that it is very vast, very profound, and .cannot be 
described in any way. 
The possession ofBuddha-essence is compared to a buried 
treasure because a treasure can provide every material need. 
But if it is covered with earth, it only has the potential to do 
so. However, if one makes the effort to take the treasure from 
the ground, one can have everything for which one has wished. 
In the same way, Buddha-essence is within all beings but it is 
covered with defilements. If one removes all the defilements 
by thereffort needed to gather· the two accumulations, one can 
ultimately achieve Buddhahood. 
In the fifth example, the obscurations are compared to 
clouds. Clouds appear in the sky and will sometimes veil the 
sun, but they are not an intrinsic part of the sky or the sun. 
They are only fleeting phenomena that can be removed. When 
the clouds cover the sun, one cannot feel the sunshine. When 
378 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the clouds are removed, the sun is perceived in its original purity. 
In the same way, there are fleeting impurities veiling our 
Buddha-essence, but these can be removed because they are 
not an inherent part of our Buddha-essence. 
The sixth example is a comparison between the great 
compassion of the Buddhas and a great wind. As long as clouds 
cover the sun, it cannot shine. As long as impurities are present, 
beings cannot achieve liberation. The compassion of the 
Buddhas removes the impurities that veil their true nature. This 
compassion acts like a strong wind that removes all the 
impurities of beings. 
291. Since their release is for others' benefit, 
since they see the equality of themselves and beings 
and since their deeds have not been fully completed, 
their activity is unbroken until samsara ends. 
$ Buddha activity is unceasing because from the very 
beginning, the Buddhas have committed themselves to the goal 
of achieving Buddhahood for the sake of other beings. 
$ Secondly, the Buddhas understand the similarity 
between themselves and other beings and they further 
understood that if they have managed to achieve Buddhahood, 
everyone else can also become a Buddha and for this reason 
their activity never ceases. 
$ A third reason that this activity is ceaseless is that the 
number of beings is infinite. The Buddhas will continue to 
help them until samsara is ended. So as long as there are beings 
in samsara, Buddha activity will never end. 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh Mtjra Point 379 
Explanation Through Nine Examples 
292. Like lndra, the drum, clouds, Brahma, the sun, 
a wish-fulfilling gem, an echo, space and earth 
is the Tathagata. 
There are nine examples that explain how the spontaneous and 
ceaseless quality of Buddha activity affects beings. 
Ct The first example of this. spontaneous quality is a 
fictional example of the god Indra who is the chief god of the 
thirty-three gods of Indian mythology. 
Ct The second example is of the drum of the gods which 
illustrates the way in which the Buddha's speech can manifest 
everywhere without any effort. The drum of the gods sounds 
in the heaven of the thirty-three gods. There is, of course, an 
element of fantasy in the way the example is presented. 
Ct The third example is of clouds that do not need any 
conscious effort to create rain illustrating how the mind of the 
Buddha functions. 
Ct The fourth example, which features the god Brahma, 
presents an illustration of all of the emanations of the Buddha. 
Ct The fifth example compares the Buddha's wisdom to 
sunshine because the radiation of the sun extends everywhere. 
In the same way, the wisdom of the Buddha is clear, perfect, 
and encompasses everything. 
The last three examples illustrate the mystery, the 
inconceivability of the mind, speech, and body of the Buddha 
that w6rk effortlessly to help beings. 
Ct The Buddha's mind is illustrated by a wish-fulfilling 
gem. 
Ct The seventh example, that of the Buddha's speech, is 
an echo that illustrates the inconceivability of the dharma. It 
380 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
can be heard everywhere by those who are ready, but it is entirely 
spontaneous. 
0 The eighth example uses space to illustrate the 
inconceivability of the physical manifestation of the Buddha 
which occurs everywhere, at any time, and in any form as 
required by the needs of beings. 
0 The ninth example of earth shows that Buddha activity 
is the ground from which all the qualities of enlightenment 
anse. 
In more detail: 
1. lndra 
293. Had the ground here the quality of flawless vaidurya, 
one would see apparent in it, through its clarity, 
the King of the Gods accompanied by hosts of young 
goddesses. 
294. 'Perfectly Victorious'- his resplendent palace, 
the divine abodes, other places with various wonders 
and all the many kinds of enjoyment that the gods possess. 
295. Seeing these appearances, multitudes of men 
and women, 
living on the surface of the Earth, would exclaim: 
296. 'Oh! May we also, before long, become like this 
divine king!' 
Having sincerely made such a prayer, so that it be realized 
they would truly adopt virtue and persist in it. 
297. Though they may not appreciate 
that these are just appearances, 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh Vajra Point 381 
they would, nevertheless, through virtue, be reborn as gods 
once they had departed from the surface of the Earth. 
298. These appearances are absolutely unintentional. 
They involve no movement. Nevertheless, 
their presence on Earth is accompanied by great benefit. 
The physical emanation of the Buddha is compared to an 
imaginary example oflndra. Imagine the ground of the whole 
world becoming lapis lazuli (vaidurya) 67 that is so clear that it 
is like a mirror that reflects the heaven in which the god Indra 
is surround by a multitude of beautiful goddesses. Staying in 
his palace called the "Perfectly Victorious" he enjoys many 
worldly delights. The lapis lazuli is so clear that everyth,ing 
occurring in heaven can be seen reflected on the ground. The 
resulting effect is that individuals feel that they should make 
prayers and gather the virtue necessary to enjoy such delights. 
This happens without any action or the intention of Indra. 
The reflection alone produces virtuous activity. 
299. In a similar way, beings with faultless faith and 
other (virtues), 
will, through practicing these qualities, 
see the perfect Buddha manifest in their minds, 
300. endowed with the marks and meaningfUl signs. 
They will see him walking, standing, sitting, sleeping and 
enacting all the modes of conduct, 
301. ptoclaiming the teachings ofpeace or, without 
speaking, remaining in meditation, performing various 
sorts of miracle and filled with magnificence and splendor. 
382 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
302. Having seen this and:folt aspiration for such 
Buddhahood, they apply themselves to it most excellently. 
Through properly adopting its causes, 
the desired state is reached. 
303. These appearances are completely concept-free 
and involve no shift. 
Though this be so, they bring great benefit to the world. 
304. Ordinary beings are believed not to understand the 
fact that thde are the manifestations of their own mind, 
yet to see such forms nevertheless brings them benefit. 
305. Progressively, through what is seen, established in the 
yana, they will see the inner true dharmakaya through eyes 
ofjnana. 
In the same way, bodhisattvas who are full of faith, diligence, 
intelligence, and who are engaged in the practice of virtue can 
see the sambhogakaya directly in contrast to ordinary beings 
for whom it is not even possible to meet the supreme 
nirmanakaya but are introduced to the teachings of the Buddha 
by means of his footprints left after he has gone. Bodhisattvas 
who have faith and all these good qualities can see the Buddha 
with his thirty-two marks and all the beautiful signs. They will 
see the Buddhas engaged in walking, standing, sitting, sleeping 
and proclaiming the teachings of peace. Sometimes they will 
see him seated in meditation without speaking and sometimes 
they will see miracles. Therefore beings that have developed 
the appropriate virtue will be able to see the Buddha. This will 
occur spontaneously. The Buddha need not direct his intention 
thinking. "I must do this." This vision of the Buddha will inspire 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh ~jra Point 383 
bodhisattvas to achieve Buddhahood and their devotion will 
be unfailing and they will apply themselves with diligence. 
All the Buddha's manifestations are completely without 
thought on the part of the Buddha, however, the beings of the 
world can see and hear the Buddha as he turns the wheel of 
dharma bringing an infinite number of beings onto the path 
to enlightenment. When ordinary beings see the form of the 
Buddha and hear his words, they do not realize that these are 
appearances arising in their mind. Even though they do not 
understand that the visions of the Buddha appear because they 
possess Buddha-essence, the seed ofliberation develops in them. 
Gradually as their experiences deepen, they will enter the 
Mahayana path. Eventually they will see the inner Buddha that 
is the dharmakaya, with the eyes of primordial wisdom. 
306. If all Earth were rid of fearful places 
and became flawless vaidurya, 
lustrous and beautiful with all that jewel's qualities, 
free from impurity, magnificent and of smooth, even surface, 
there would appear, on account of such purity, 
the various divine abodes and the form of the King of Gods.. 
By the gradual disappearance of such a ground's qualities, 
these things would once again no longer be apparent. 
307. In order to obtain such a state, 
many men and women would turn to the 'precepts 
of mindfulness,' true generosity and so forth, 
scatter flowers and do other similar deeds, 
their minds full of aspiration. 
In a similar way, in order to become . 
the mighty Victor King, who had appeared in their mind, 
comparable to pure vaidurya 
384 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
bodhisattvas develop their 'mind' perfectly, 
their spirit being filled with great joy. 
Expanding this example, if all of the frightening places such as 
cliffs and abysses were eliminated and covered with lapis lazuli; 
if the earth were completely free from impurities so that it 
resembled a mirror, one could see the various paradises. But 
later on, little by little, the ground would gradually lose its 
polish and little by little the reflection of paradise would begin 
to disappear. However, having seen the reflection, beings would 
be inspired and many men and women would continue to 
practice and make offerings aspiring to enter such a paradise. 
308. just as the reflection of the King of Gods 
appears in the clear vaidurya ground, 
so also does the reflection of the King of Sages' form 
appear in the clear ground which is beings' minds. 
In the same way, when the Buddha appears in the pure surface 
of the mind that is like vaidurya, individuals are inspired to 
reach the same level of realization as that of the Buddha. 
Accordingly, these sons of the Victorious Ones (the 
bodhisattvas) will nurture bodhichitta so that a great joy will 
develop and a strong wish to foster all of the qualities of 
understanding from which enlightenment will arise. 
309. For beings, the appearance and disappearance 
of these reflections occur through their minds' condition, 
polluted or unpolluted. 
Similar to such manifestations of form in the worlds, 
these should not be taken as existing or extinct entities. 
Buddha Activity -The Seventh ~jra Point 385 
These reflections can change. When the ground i&. very pure, it 
is like a mirror oflapis lazuli; but when the ground is less pure, 
the reflection disappears. In the same way, when beings have 
great faith, devotion and many pure qualities, they can see the 
Buddhas. When their mind is less pure, they can no longer see 
the Buddhas. Indra and the Buddhas are always present, so 
whether they appear depends upon whether the mind of beings . . Is pure or Impure. 
2. The Divine Drumbeat- Buddha Speech 
31 0. Through the power of the gods' former goodness 
the dharma drum in the divine realms, 
without e./fort, location, mental form or concept, 
311. exhorts all the uncaring gods over and over again 
with its throbs of'impermanence,' 'suffering,' 
' lf' d' ' no-se an peace. 
312. Like this, the all-pervading is also without e./fort and 
the like, yet Buddha speech reaches all beings, without 
exception, teaching the noble doctrine to th'e fortunate. 
313. just as the divine drum beats for devas, 
through their former karma, so also does the Sage's dharma 
speech arise in the world, due to karma. 
just as its sound, without effort, source, form or mind, 
brings peace, so also is peace procured by dharma 
without effort or the other things. 
314. The sound of the drum in the celestial citadel 
is the cause which both ends divine play 
and also bestows fearlessness, to vanquish asura armies 
386 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
when, through defilement, war occurs. Like this, 
that arising from such as formless meditation proclaims, 
in the worlds, the way of the insurpassable path of peace, 
to defeat, totaliJ, sentient beings' defilements and sufferings. 
315. Universal joyously beneficial and having threefold 
miracles, the Sages' melody is superior to the celestial 
cymbals. 
316. The mighty sound of the divine drum 
cannot reach Earthling ears, 
yet the sound of Buddha speech 
is heard in samsara's underworld. 
317. In the heavens, tens of millions of celestial cymbals 
resound to ·reinforce desire's fire, yet those whose identity is 
compassion give forth a single melody to extinguish, totally, 
suffering's fire. 
318. The beautiful and pleasant music of cymbals in the 
heavens brings increased mental agitation. 
The speech of the tathagatas, whose nature is compassion, 
turns the mind towards samadhi and stimulates reflection. 
319. In brief, it is said that the cause of happiness 
for those in each and every universe, in heaven or on Earth, 
depends entirely upon that very melody, 
all-pervasively manifest in every world. 
320. just as those with no hearing cannot experience subtle 
sound and even those with divine hearing cannot hear every 
sound, so likewise is the subtle dharma, the domain of very 
Buddha Activity -The Seventh ~jra Point 387 
finest jnana, to be heard by only those few whose mind is 
undefiled. 
In the second example, the dru.m of the gods is only a term 
for the spontaneous manifestation of the sound of dharma. 
Because of the previous virtue of the gods, the sound of 
dharma can be heard spontaneously in some heavens. One 
can hear the constant sound of the words "impermanence," 
" fj'l: • " " lf' " d " " h h . su 1er1ng, no-se , an peace t oug no one 1s prese·nt 
to make those sounds. 
This example illustrates the way in which the speech of the 
Buddha can manifest without effort or thought. The Buddha's 
teaching can be heard anywhere by spiritually developed 
individuals. The Buddha's speech, however, is far more powerful 
than the drum of the gods because the sound of the drum can't 
be heard by beings outside of the divine realms, while the speech 
of the Buddhas can be heard even in the subterranean worlds. 
3. Clouds -the all-pervading compassionate mind 
321. In the rainy season, clouds continually and effortlessly 
pour down vast amounts of water onto the earth 
and are the cause for good and bountifol crops. 
322. Likewise, clouds of compassion, without any 
conceptualizing, rain down the waters of the Victors noble 
teachings and cause a harvest of virtue for sentient beings. 
323. Provided that the world is engaged in virtues ways, 
the win,d-borne clouds will cause a fall of rain. 
Likewise the wind of compassion causes Buddha clouds 
to cascade their rain of true teachings 
to increase virtue in beings. 
388 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
324. In the world, through great compassionate love and 
knowledge, the clouds of the Lord of All Sages abide amid 
space unblemished by either that which changes or the 
changeless. 
As their unspoilt essence, 
they have samadhi and dharani waters, 
which are the very cause for the harvest of virtue there. 
325. Cool delicious, soft, light water fallen from the clouds 
acquires many different tastes, 
by contact with salty and other grounds. 
Likewise the rain of the eightfold water of the sublime, 
falling from the heart of that vastest cloud 
of compassionate love, 
assumes many a flavor, 
according to beings' various mentalities. 
326. Those of appreciative faith, the middling 
and those with animosity 
form three groups comparable to humans, peafowl and 
pretas. 
327. In the cloudless end of spring, men and these 
non-flyers suffer. 
In t/:le summertime, when it rains, ihe pretas suffer. 
This example is drawn upon to illustrate how, 
depending upon whether there is a rain of dharma or not, 
worldly beings will either aspire to it or feel animosity. 
328. Making a deluge of mighty raindrops, 
hurling down hailstones or thunderbolts, 
clouds do not consider the small fauna 
or those who run to the hills. 
Buddha Activity -The Seventh ~jra Point 389 
Similarly, clouds of perfect knowledge and compassionate 
love, with their very fine or larger drops, do not mind that 
some will purify their defilements while others tend to 
believe in self 
329. In this samsara of beginningless birth and death, 
there are five sorts of sentient being. 
just as there is no pleasant smell in excrement, 
there is no true contentment among those five. 
Their sufferings are like the incessant pain 
of burns, wounds, chemical scalds and so forth. 
The clouds of compassion cause a mighty rain 
of true dharma, which will soothe all these. 
330. Those endowed with prajna have no longing 
for even the highest celestial or human sovereignty, 
having understood that divine death and transmigration 
or humanity's constant searching are all 'misery. ' 
They have also seen, through prajna and through following, 
with faith, the Tathagatas' excellent teaching: 
'This is suffering,' 'this is its cause, ' 
and 'this is its cessation' through' understanding.' 
331. just as a disease needs to be diagnosed, its cause 
eliminated, a healthy state achieved and the remedy 
implemented, so also should suffering, its cause, its cessation 
and the path be known, removed, attained and undertaken. r-· 
The third example compares the mind of the Buddha with 
clouds. lrt a country which experiences a monsoon, the clouds 
constantly produce huge quantities of summer rain that, of 
course, allows the crops to grow. In the same way, the mind 
and compassion of the Buddha constantly produces the rain of 
390 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
dharma that enables the crops of virtue of beings to flourish. 
This rain is the rain of the Four Noble Truths. This can be 
understood by employing the example of illness: (1) If one is 
sick then, (2) one must discover the cause of the sickness to be 
cured. Next, (3) one must be willing to undergo treatment for 
the illness, and (4) one must then take the medicine. In terms 
) ' of the Four Truths: (1) one must understand that there is 
suffering, (2) one must discover the cause of this suffering, 
which is karma and the defilements. Next, (3) when one has 
eliminated the causes of the suffering, the suffering will stop. 
Finally, (4) the truth of the path is like a medicine that liberates 
one from suffering. This is what is meant when it is said that 
the Buddha pours down on beings the rains of the Four Truths. 
4. Brahma -emanation 
332. Without effort and without departing from his 
Brahma heaven, Brahma can manifest his presence in 
any divine realm. 
333. Likewise, never departing from dharmakaya, 
the great Victor effortlessly manifests emanations in 
any sphere, to the mature. 
334. Without leaving his palq.ce, 
Brahma manifests in the sense realm. 
Seeing him there makes its gods 
abandon pursuit of the sensorial. 
Similarly, the Sugatas, while never leaving the 
dharmakaya, are perceived in every world sphere by 
those who are ready. 
The vision constantly causes them to relinquish impurity. 
Buddha Activity -The Seventh Vajra Point 391 
335. Due to the power of his former prayers, 
and the gods' own virtue, 
Brahma appears effortlessly. 
Forms of the Spontaneous appear similarly. 
The way in which the Buddha emanates is illustrated by a 
fictitious fourth example ofBrahma. The three dimensions or 
realms of samsara are the desire, the form and the formless 
realm. It is in the form realm in his own heaven that Brahma 
resides. He remains there continually and has no desire to 
manifest anywhere else. }Iowever, his emanation can be seen 
in all the other heavens of the gods without any deliberate 
intention on his part. In the same way, the Buddha appears in 
the sambhogakaya form to individuals who are spiritually 
mature and to the less spiritually mature in the nirmanakaya 
form, while the Buddha himself resides in the dharmakaya. 
336. Descent, entering the womb, going to his father's 
palace, enjoyment, solitary practice, the subjugation of 
negativity, attainment enlightenment and teaching the path 
to the city of peace, having demonstrated these, the Great 
Sage became invisible to those of insufficient maturity. 
Having experienced five visions, our present Buddha, the 
Shakyamuni Buddha, left Tushita pure realm to enter our world. 
His mother dreamt of a six tusked elephant and he subsequently 
took birth in the garden at Lumbini. He then spent many years 
in the palace of his father learning many different skills and 
enjoying the company of friends and consorts. Disillusioned 
with sams'ara, he left the palace and for the next six years 
practiced great austerities. He then tackled all the negative forces 
and defeated them achieving Buddhahood under the bodhi tree. 
Having reached enlightenment, he went to Sarnath and in the 
392 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
deer park turned the first wheel of the dharma. So while the 
Buddha was available to those who were spiritually prepared at 
the time, the Buddha could also be seen in the dharmakaya. 
This makes it clear that the Buddha can manifest in many ways 
and never leave the dharmakaya. 
5. The Sun -wisdom's penetration 
337. Whe.n the sun shines, lotuses and similar flowers open. 
At the same time, the kumata flowers close up completely. 
The sun has no opinion of good, or 'bad' that these, 
the 'water-born• flowers, be either open or closed. 
Also like this is the Sun of Beings- the Perfectly-Realized 
One. 
338. The s~n, without ideation and by its own light's 
radiation simultaneously makes lotuses bloom and other 
things ripen. 
339. Similarly, without ideation, the Tathagata sun pours 
forth rays of true dharma on those 'lotus' beings to be 
trained. 
340. Through the dharma and form kaya, the sun of 
omniscience rises in the firmament of the essence of 
enlightenment, to send forth its sunbeams ofjnana into 
sentient beings. 
341. Due to this, the Sugata sun appears at one and the 
same time in countless reflections in all the 'water vessels., 
which are sentient beings to be guided. 
Buddha Activity -The Seventh Vttjra Point 393 
342. Continually, from amid the sky of all-pervading 
dharmadhatu, in a manner determined by the power of 
their own merit, shine forth the Buddha sun on the 
mountain-like disciples. 
343. just as the risen sun, with thousands of magnificent 
rays, illuminates the universe, shedding its light in turn 
on first the highest summits, then the lower, then the plains, 
likewise does that sun, the Victorious One, shed his light 
progressively upon the multitudes of beings. 
344. The sun cannot radiate to the depths of space in every 
realm nor show the meaning of what is to be known 
to those obscured by the darkness of ignorance. 
The one identical with compassion shows beings the 
significance of that which should be known, clarity, 
through spectra of radiant multiple color. 
345. When the Buddha goes to cities, the eyeless see. 
They experience, through that seeing, the meaningful 
free from the various aspects of what is not beneficial. 
Their intelligence illuminated by the light of the Buddha 
sun, those blinded by ignorance, fallen into the ocean of 
existence and veiled by the darkness of preconceived ideas, 
see the essence they had not previously seen. 
The fifth .example employs the example of the sun to illustrate 
the way in which the wisdom of the Buddhas function. The 
sun, without thinking, shines simultaneously everywhere on 
the earth. Different flowers react differently to sunlight; lotuses 
open and kumuta flowers close automatically. In the same way, 
the Buddhas shine the light of dharma on the lotus flowers of 
the mind of beings. Some will open up, experience devotion 
394 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
and practice the teachings, while others will react like the 
kumuta flowers and close up and will continue to wander in 
samsara. Wheh this happens, the ;Buddha is not at fault just as 
the sun cannot be blamed when the kumuta flowers close. 
When the Buddhas turn the wheel of dharma, they do not 
have any particular objective in mind. For instance, they don't 
consciously think, "I must establish the dharma first in India 
so it will flourish in this place" and so on. Instead, they teach 
the dharma whenever it is needed and to whomever can derive 
benefit from it. Through the natural power of Buddha activity, 
the teachings take place, beings receive them and employ them 
to reach liberation. 
The example of the sun is limited because the activity of 
the Buddha's wisdom extends much further than the warmth 
of the sun. The sun can remove only ordinary darkness while 
the Buddha's wisdom can dispel the darkness of ignorance and 
awaken the knowledge of the true nature of all phenomena. 
6. The Wish-Fulfilling Gem -the mystery of mind 
346. A wish-fulfilling gem, though not thinking, 
fulfills simultaneously all the wishes 
of those within the sphere of its activity. 
347. Likewise, Buddha does not think, 
though those of varying aspiration hear various. teaching, 
when turning to the wish-fulfilling Buddha. 
348. Such a precious gem bestows the desired wealth on 
others, perfectly, effortlessly and without any concept. 
Similarly, effortlessly and however appropriate, 
the Great Sage remains constantly in the world 
to help others for as long as it persists. 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh Vttjra Point 395 
349. just as it is difficult for beings here desirous of such a 
gem to find one, because it lies underground or in the ocean's 
depths, so should one know it to be difficult 
for beings here to see a Sugata, 
since they are poorly fated and in the grasp of defilements. 
The sixth example illustrates the mystery of the Buddhas' mind. 
It is a mystery because it transcends conceptualization and is 
so subtle. It is compared to a wish-fulfilling gem. In the presence 
of a wish-fulfilling gem, individual's needs are granted. Even 
though they may have wanted many different things, their 
wishes were fulfilled with no thought or intention of the gem. 
In the same way, there are many beings that have different 
aspirations, wishes and interests. The Buddhas offer them 
whatever teaching is appropriate to lead them to a higher 
existence. Some beings require the Hinayana teachings, some 
the Mahayana teachings and some the Vajrayana teachings. All 
ofthese teachings manifest without any conscious thought. 
7. An Echo -mystery of speech 
350. The echo's sound arises due to others'faculties of 
cognition. 
Concept-free, it is effortless, 
and abides neither without nor within. 
351. Likewise· Tathagata speech arises due to others' 
cognitive faculties and is concept-free, 
effortless and neither without n(Jr within. 
The seventh example of an echo suggests the depth of the 
mystery of the Buddhas' speech, which also completely 
transcends conceptualization and is extremely subtle. The sound 
396 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
of an echo is due to the cognitive faculties of others, while the 
echo itself is devoid of any intention to be heard. An echo does 
not come from the inside or the outside. In the same way, the 
Buddha's speech manifests according to a particular person's 
spiritual maturity, while the sound of dharma itself is devoid 
of any thought or effort. It abides neither inside nor outside 
the Buddhas' body. 
8. Space -·the mystery of form 
352. Even though space is nothing whatsoever, non­
manifest, not a mental object, without foundation, 
completely invisible, without form and not demonstrable, 
353. it is seen as being up' or aown,, 
yet space is not like that. 
Likewise nothing seen in relation to Buddha 
is like Buddha at all. 
The eighth example compares the mystery of the Buddha's form 
to space, which is inconceivable and subtle. Space doesn't have 
any substance, yet it provides the container within which 
everything occurs. In the same way, the body of the Buddha 
does not have any real existence, but it is present to help beings 
everywhere. The Buddha doesn't think, "I am going to be in 
this form and in this particular place," but whenever beings are 
ready, a form of the Buddha will manifest. 
9. Earth -application of compassion 
354. Everything which grows from the ground develops, 
becomes firm and grows 
through depending upon the thought-free earth. 
Buddha Activity -The Seventh Vtljra Point 397 
355. Likewise, every root of beings' virtue, without 
exception, increases through dependence 
on the thought-free Buddha ground. 
The ninth example compares the great compassion of the 
Buddha to the earth. The earth without any thought provides 
the foundation for everything to grow and once it has grown it 
allows everything to continue to live. So without deliberation, 
without thought at all, the earth acts as the basis oflife. In the 
same way, the Buddhas who possess complete and direct 
knowledge of the nature of phenomena spontaneously manifest 
the qualities of body, speech and mind providing a ground out 
of which all the virtues and good qualities develop. They nurture 
these qualities and allow them to flourish on the earth. 
The Purpose of these Examples 
356. Since ordinary beings do not perceive action without 
effort, these nine examples were taught to annihilate 
disciples' doubts. 
In ordinary life, when we want to achieve something, we have 
to marshal our energy and put effort into what we hope to 
accomplish. For this reason when we hear that Buddha activity 
is effortless, we might have doubts because it is hard to conceive 
of effortless activity. These nine examples are given to remove 
such doubts and to explain how the Buddha's activity is 
completely effortless. 
357. These nine examples have been excellently and fully 
taught in a sutra of a name which explains their purpose. 
398 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
358. The Wise, adorned with the great light of wisdom, 
born of such study, will swiftly enter all Buddha domains. 
359. The point has been taught through nine examples 
such as Indra's reflection in vaidurya. 
The meaning they illustrate excellently are: 
360. Manifestation, speech, all-pervasiveness, emanations, 
the radiance ofjnana, the 'mysteries' of body, speech and 
mind and possession of a compassionate nature. 
These nine examples were taught in detail in the Ornament of 
the Light ofWisdom Sutra. There are two reasons for studying 
them: to remove any doubts about effortless activity of the 
Buddha and, on a deeper level, to bring the bodhisattva quickly 
to Buddhahood. 
361. All channels of effort have been pacified totally, 
because their mind is free of ideation, 
just like Indra's reflection and so forth 
appearing in the stainless vaidurya. 
362. Here, 'pacification of effort' is the proposition, 
the 'mind free of ideation' is the logical justification. 
The examples, lndra and so forth, help establish naturalness. 
363. The point being made is that the Shower of the way, 
who is beyond birth and death, 
manifests effortlessly these nine; appearances and so forth. 
364. Effortless altruistic action, for as long as existence 
endures and like that of lndra, the drum, clouds, Brahma, 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh Vajra Point 399 
the sun, the majestic wish-fulfilling gem, an echo, space or 
the earth, is understood by the Great Yogin alone. 
These nine examples illustrate the manifestation of the body, 
speech, and all-pervasiveness of the Buddha's mind, the 
emanations of the Buddha, the all-embracing qualities of his 
wisdom, the mysterious aspects of his body, speech, and mind 
and his compassion. 
In ordinary existence we are only familiar with activity that 
is connected with physical or mental effort. The activity of the 
Buddha, on the other hand, is effortless because he is free from 
any deliberation concerning the accomplishment of his 
activities. The Buddha does not need to deliberate because he 
possesses the wisdom that enables him to understand that all 
phenomena are empty. He doesn't need to think, "Now I will 
act in this way." Relying on the wisdom of variety, which 
provides him with the full knowledge of the multiplicity of 
phenomena, the Buddha can act spontaneously, completely 
without effort. 
365. Similar to lndra's jewel appearance is manifestation, 
like the divine drum is the perfect bestowing of instruction, 
and like the hosts of clouds 
are perfect knowledge and compassion 
with which the All-Embracing pervades limitless beings, 
up to the summit of conditioned existence. 
366. Similarly to Brahma, they manifest many an 
emanation, without ever departing from their untainted 
domain. 
Like the sun, they radiate universally their jnana light 
and like the wish-fUlfilling gem, perfectly pure is their mind. 
400 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
367. Like an echo, devoid of any verbalizing, is the 
Victors speech. 
Like space, all-pervading, formless and permanent is their 
body and like the earth, the universal ground for all 
medicinal herbs that are beings' virtues, is the state of 
Buddhahood. 
368. One sees the Buddhas in this mind, 
compart:tble to pure vaidurya, 
through minds purity, development of the faculty 
of irreversible faith. 
369. Since this virtue appears and disappears, 
the forms of the Buddha may also appear and disappear. 
However, like Indra, the Great Sages dharmakaya 
is beyond such arising and destruction. 
370. Like him, in a way which is effortless 
and from this dharmakaya, which is without birth or death, 
Buddhas engage in activity, such as manifestation, 
for as long as conditioned existence continues. 
In the examples, the physical manifestation of the Buddha is 
represented by the reflection of Indra on the ground of lapis 
lazuli, the Buddha's speech by the drum of the gods,_ and the 
Buddha's mind by the clouds and so on. 
3 71. Here follows a summarized meaning of the examples 
taught in which, in order, dissimilarities are eliminated 
from the former to the latter. 
372. The Buddha is like that reflection, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it does not have his melody. 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh ~jra Point 401 
He is Like the celestial drum, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it is not universally beneficial. 
Someone may think, "Well, one example would have been 
sufficient, why present all nine examples?" The reason that all 
of these examples are presented is that Buddha activity is so 
subtle that it cannot be represented by just one example. 
Examples have limitations and the limitation of each example 
necessitates a further example. 
The limitation of the first example of lapis lazuli ground, 
is that Indra's reflection is only a physical reflection. When the 
Buddha appears, this reflection is also accompanied by the 
sound of dharma. The second example of the drum of the gods 
illustrates the effortless manifestation of the Buddha's speech, 
but this example is also limited because the drum is sometimes 
beneficial and sometimes it is not. This sound is beneficial only 
if beings heed what they have heard. All the words of the 
Buddha's speech, however, continually nurture the spiritual 
maturity of beings. 
373. He is Like that vast cloud, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it cannot remove useless seeds. 
He is like Mahabrahma, but not the same, 
inasmuch as the latter does not engender lasting maturity. 
The third example of a rain cloud doesn't suffice because a 
rain cloud can only create a short-term benefit for beings, 
but it cannot eliminate impurities. Buddha activity has the 
additional long-term benefit of reducing the negativity which 
beings experience. For this reason, a fourth example ofBrahma 
is needed. Brahma can exert a very positive influence on those 
who are in his presence. However, he cannot be compared to 
402 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
the Buddha because Brahma cannot eliminate the seed of 
the negativity. 
3 7 4. He is like the form of the sun, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it cannot vanquish darkness forever. 
He is like the wish-fulfilling gem, but not the same, 
inasmuch as its appearance is not that difficult to 'encounter. 
In the fifth example of the sun dispelling darkness, the sun can 
only dispel darkness during the day and at night the darkness 
returns, while Buddha activity can permanently dispel the 
darkness of ignorance. A sixth example is required to illustrate 
the endless benefit of Buddha activity. In the sixth example of 
the wish-fulfilling gem, the limitation is the solidity of the gem, 
however the activity of the Buddha manifests from a state that 
completely transcends either existence or non-existence. For 
this reason, afurther example is required to illustrate emptiness. 
3 75. He is like an echo, but not the same, 
inasmuch as it arises through conditions. 
He is like space, but not the same, 
inasmuch as that is not the basis for goodness. 
The seventh example, an echo is used to illustrate emptiness. 
However, the sound of an echo requires a person to hear the 
sound and a rock to reflect the sound for an echo. Buddha 
activity is always present independent of any other conditions. 
For this reason, in the eighth example Buddha activity is 
compared to space. Space is always present and is naturally 
changeless, however, one cannot claim that space is the source 
of all the virtues that arise, while Buddha activity is the ground 
from which all happiness and all the good qualities of 
Buddha Activity- The Seventh Vttjra Point 403 
Buddhahood come from. For this reason the ninth example of 
the earth is required. 
376. He is like the mandala of the earth, 
being the supportive ground 
for absolutely every single goodness in sentient life, 
be it mundane or supramundane, 
because the supramundane path 
arises on the basis of the Buddha's enlightenment, 
as do the paths of virtuous actions, concentrative meditation, 
the limitless contemplations and the formless ones. 
The last example, the ninth, compares Buddha activity with 
the earth. This example illustrates how Buddha activity is the 
ground from which all the qualities of enlightenment arise. 
Buddha activity is the ground from which the ultimate 
qualities of the Buddha, the levels of the bodhisattva, the 
qualities of meditation, and the immeasurable virtues of the 
Buddhas emerge. 
This was the fourth chapter on the "Tathagatas' Activity"from 
the Analysis of the Potential for the Rare and Sublime in this 
Ultimate Mahayana Treatise on the Changeless Continuity 
of the True Nature. 

Part Three: 
CONCLUSION 

BENEFITS OF THE TEXT 
3 77. Buddha-essence, the Buddha's enlightenment, 
Buddhahood's qualities and enlightened activity 
are inconceivable things, even for purified beings, 
as they are the domain of experience of their Guides. 
THE UTTARATANTRA makes it clear that: 
~ all beings possess Buddha-essence, 
~ how these qualities manifest, 407 
~ which qualities develop once enlightenment has been 
achieved; what qualities will develop from enlightenment, and 
~ how these qualities continue to help all sentient beings. 
These are the four principal topics of the Uttaratantra, called 
the four inconceivables because most beings, including 
bodhisattvas, cannot have a direct understanding of them. 
378. The wise who trust this domain of the Buddhas 
become vessels for multitudes of Buddha qualities. 
Genuinely delighting in a host of inconceivable qualities, 
-they surpass the virtues of every sentient being. 
Thes~ qualities and the ways in which they manifest are 
inconceivable but the wise, meaning those with intelligence, 
diligence, and faith, will become a vessel for them. Great faith, 
sincere aspiration and an indirect understanding of these 
408 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
qualities are the conditions that enable those who genuinely 
aspire to practice to become a vessel. In turn, this leads to the 
development of all the qualities of freedom and maturity of a 
Buddha. An understanding of the Uttaratantra is like the first 
step towards the development of the qualities of a Buddha 
because it gives one the confidence tha.t it is actually possible 
to achieve enlightenment. Those who are drawn to these 
qualities are planting the garden of delight in their mind. From 
these qualities all of the virtues grow. It is the same as if a root 
is planted to produce a tree; unless this root is planted there is 
no hope that the tree will grow. Once very strong virtue has 
been planted, it will grow until realization. Somebody with 
this type of virtue surpasses the virtue of any other, because 
this virtue that will bring one to the qualities of freedom and 
maturity of enlightenment. Studying and meditating on the 
meaning of the Uttaratantra is more beneficial than practicing 
generosity, skillful conduct, or patience. 
The subject of this text is very precious because if someone 
studies this text, it will definitely help him or her reach 
Buddhahood. Although the subject of this text is inconceivable 
to ordinary beings, if one studies this teaching with faith and 
practices it accordingly, one will reach Buddhahood. In 
more detail: 
379. One who hears but one word of this 
and, having heard, has faith, 
will attain greater virtue than another who, striving for 
bodhi, offers golden lands adorned with jewels, equal in 
number to all the atoms in the Buddha.fields, 
to the dharma king, daily. 
Suppose a bodhisattva practices great generosity in an attempt 
to reach enlightenment by every day making as many offerings 
Benefits of the Text 409 
of golden lands adorned with jewels as there are atoms in the 
Buddhafields. If another bodhisattva simply heard the words 
of this text and understood that this teaching is really a direct 
cause for reaching enlightenment and with faith and inspiration 
was moved to achieve enlightenment, this bodhisattva would 
have accumulated more virtue than the bodhisattva who was 
making so many offerings. 
380. One who hears but one word of this 
and, having heard, has faith 
will attain greater virtue than that of the right conduct 
practiced by the wise, longing for highest enlightenment 
and maintaining proper conduct of body, speech and mind, 
be it even for many cosmic eons. 
A second example shows how even the virtue of keeping very 
pure moral conduct is eclipsed by the faith in this teaching. If 
a person who aspires to reach enlightenment by maintaining 
immaculate conduct of body, speech and mind for eons and 
eons so that all negative actions are given up effortlessly were 
compared to a person inspired by this text, and being inspired 
with great enthusiasm, great joy, faith, and devotion, the 
accumulated virtue of the latter person would be much greater. 
381. One who hears but one word of this 
and, having heard, has faith, 
will attain greater virtue 
than that of the meditative stability of others 
whose dhyana rids the three worlds of defilements' fires 
and brings achievement of the divine state 
of Brahma's paradise, 
even if practiced as a way 
to supreme, immutable enlightenment. 
410 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
Suppose someone had practiced meditative stability to 
extinguish the fire of defilements which leads to the existence 
in the three realms of samsara, and through this meditation 
had extinguished this fire. If this meditation were compared to 
the study and practice of this text, the benefits of the latter 
would be greater. 
382. Generosity brings a.ffluence, 
right conduct leads to higher states, 
meditative stability removes defilements but prajna removes 
all defilements as well as what is cognitive. 
Therefore this prajna is a most excellent thing: 
its cause is to study such as this. 
383. The presence, what it becomes, its qualities and 
accomplishing that which is good: these four points are the 
domain of Buddhas perfect knowledge, as has been 
explained. 
384. Through faith in these, the fact of this presence, 
it being the power and with qualities endowed, 
the wise are quickly ripe for tathagata achievement. 
385. Through faith, one believes this inconceivable domain 
present, attainable by someone like me' and, once attained, 
to have such qualities and such endowments. 
386. Therefore bodhichitta is ever present in them, as a 
vessel for the qualities of earnest aspiration, joyfol endeavor, 
mindfUlness, meditative stability, prajna and the others. 
387. As this is constantly present, the Victors offipring do 
not deviate. 
Benefits of the Text 411 
The paramita they establish, through virtue, 
are perfected to become immaculate. 
How is it possible that the virtue of simply hearing this teaching 
and developing interest and faith in it can exceed the virtue 
that is generated by very great generosity, skillful conduct, or 
meditative stability? The answer is that generosity brings 
affluence, the practice of skillful conduct brings rebirth in higher 
realms, and the practice of meditation decreases defilements. 
However, the Uttaratantra, reveals the inconceivable qualities 
which can lead to prajna. The development of prajna decreases 
the obscurations and as a result insight and the qualities of 
realization increase. These are the first steps toward 
Buddhahood. Hearing this teaching and developing an interest 
in it will cause one to achieve Buddhahood. For this reason, 
the development of prajna is more efficacious than the 
development of other virtues. 
A further benefit is related to this teaching. The 
Uttaratantra teaches that there is Buddha-essence in all beings, 
which is veiled by transitory obscurations. However, these 
can be removed so that enlightenment is revealed. What 
manifests is not a vacuum, but the full possession of the 
qualities of freedom and maturity. With the possession of these 
qualities, spontaneously, effortlessly, and ceaselessly one will 
work for the benefit of all beings. 
The teachings of the Uttaratantra constitute the exclusive 
domain of knowledge of all of the Buddhas. However, if 
someone hears this teaching and studies it, they will begin to 
understand that they already possess the seed ofBuddhahood. 
Knowing this, they will develop the confidence to become a 
Buddha. So having heard this teaching and following it, the 
teachings become the cause of becoming a Buddha. If one 
understands the four inconceivables, this understanding will 
412 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
effotdessly give rise to the qualities of strong aspiration, 
diligence, mindfulness, meditative stability, prajna, and so 
on. These qualities will arise spontaneously and aspiration 
based on bodhichitta for the benefit of all beings will arise 
and increase. 
388. Virtue, as the first five paramita, is brought to 
perfection by an absence of any triplistic thought 
concerning them. 
They are completely purified by removal of their opposites. 
389. Virtue born of giving is generosity. 
Virtue born of correct action is right conduct. 
Forbearance and meditative stability 
are both born of meditation. 
joyous diligence is a companion for all. 
Once these teachings have been understood, it isn't possible to 
fall back and the virtue that has been accumulated will be 
brought to perfection by the practice of the other five paramitas. 
This occurs because when aspiration is brought to the study of 
the teachings, a quality develops which opposes the 
preoccupation with "I" and "other." This teaching, then, can 
vanquish thoughts based on the three circles and by vanquishing 
these thoughts we will be made complete and pure.68 
By practicing the five paramitas of generosity, right conduct, 
forbearance, meditation, and joyous diligence virtue is gathered. 
The virtue that arises from generosity is gathered through 
giving; the virtue arising from skillful conduct is gathered by 
maintaining very pure conduct; the virtues of meditative 
forbearance and meditative stability developed from practice; 
and the virtue that arises from exertion when all of the other 
qualities are practiced with diligence. 
Benefits of the Text 413 
390. 'Triplistic thoughts' are considered to be the cognitive 
obscuration; avaricious thoughts, and the like, the 
defilement obscuration. 
391. Other than prajna, there is no means for removing 
these. 
Therefore prajna is the best of all the paramita. 
Its basis is study such as this; such study is supreme. 
The next benefit that is derived from the knowledge and practice 
of these teachings is the elimination of obscurations. The 
cognitive obscurations are those of three-fold thoughts, of 
dividing things into a subject, object, and the action between 
them. For example, in practicing generosity th~ outer object 
may be a poor person, the subject may be a bodhisattva, and 
the action is what is given. The belief that these three elements 
are real will pollute the generosity and create a cognitive 
obscuration. Emotional obscurations are negative thoughts such 
as those of greed that prevents generosity. These obscurations 
prevent us from achieving enlightenment. When these 
obscurations are present, there is no way to achieve liberation. 
Even diligent practice of the paramitas will not eliminate 
them. The only way to eliminate obscurations is through 
prajna. This is why the practice of prajna is so important. We 
can develop prajna by studying sutras or the shastras that 
explain the profound teachings related to absolute truth. In 
sum, the cause which promotes the development of prajna is 
the study of the profound topics and why studying the 
Uttaratantra is so important. It is for this reason that this set 
of teachings is so important. 
414 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
How the Uttaratantra was Composed 
392. Thus, on the basis of the trustworthy words of Lord 
Buddha and of reason, I have given this teaching 
in order to purify myself alone and, further, to nurture 
intelligent beings -those having faith and virtue. 
393. just as when, aided by a lamp, lightening, a gem, 
the sun or moon, those with eyes can see, 
so likewise, by relying on the Great Sage, 
who radiates the light of meanings, 
terms, dharma and dharani, 
I have now properly expounded this. 
394. Whatever has significance and is well-connected with 
dharma is a teaching removing the three worlds' defilements, 
showing peace's benefit: such is the Truthful One's teaching. 
What is contrary to this is something other. 
395. Whatever those of perfectly undistracted mind have 
expounded, solely in accordance with the teaching of the 
Victorious One and conducive to the path for attaining 
liberation, should also be placed on the head, like the 
Buddha's own words. 
First, the Uttaratantra was written by Asanga based upon the 
teachings of the Buddha Maitreya. It was based on the words 
of the Buddha and written in accordance with the sutras, 
particularly two sutras that expound absolute truth. 
Second, though he relied on the words of the Buddha, 
Asanga also relied on logical reasoning to clarify doubts. He 
also employed the direct cognition of the yogis. His purpose 
was to purify Buddha-essence, which is the very nature of the 
Benefits of the Text 415 
dharmakaya and help those who aspire to achieve Buddhahood 
by teaching the Mahayana path. One might think that if 
scriptural sources are absorbed, the use oflogic is unnecessary. 
However, a combination of both scriptures and logic is required. 
For example, to see objects, one requires the external condition 
of a light of some sort, such as the sun or a lamp, and one also 
needs an inner condition of good eyesight. It isn't enough to 
have just one condition. In the same way, a combination of the 
outer condition of knowledge of the meaning of the words and 
the inner condition of logical reasoning are needed to 
understand what the Buddha taught. 
Third, one needs to determine if one can trust these 
teachings of the Buddha. The teachings of the Great Sages 
remove all defilements connected with the three realms and 
demonstrate the benefits of peace. For this reason, authentic 
teachings must include exactly how nirvana is to be achieved 
and be closely connected with the dharma. They should 
remove the defilements of all three realms of samsara and 
should produce peace of mind once that liberation is achieved. 
A teaching without these characteristics is not a teaching of 
the Buddha. 
The shastras, while not the Buddha's words, are worthy of 
respect and have the following characteristics. They are not 
composed out of a desire for fame, but are written to help spread 
the teachings and help other beings on the path. The authors 
of the shastras don't follow their fancy, but write with a 
completely unobstructed mind strictly in accordance with the 
Buddha's teachings. Their works also have the quality of being 
conducive to the path ofliberation so it is possible by practicing 
the shastras to achieve liberation. This is because these teachings 
are in harmony with the conditions that lead to liberation. 
Because those who compose the shasrras have pure motivation 
and because the teachings are so close to what the Buddha 
416 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
himself would say, they are worthy of being placed on one's 
head in the same way one would place the words of the Buddha 
himself on one's head.69 
396. Since no one of this world has more dharma skill than 
Buddha, the Omniscient One who properly knows all 
without exception as being the supreme suchness, which 
others ignore, whatever sutra were expounded by the Great 
Sage in person should not be adulterated; such would harm 
the true dharma through destroying the way of the Mighty 
Victor. 
The Buddha has total knowledge of the nature of phenomena 
because he is completely pure. The bodhisattvas possess many, 
but not all of these characteristics. Whatever the Buddha taught 
in the sutras shouldn't be adulterated, meaning one shouldn't 
claim that this part of the teaching is correct, but that part is 
not. This would confuse the presentation of the dharma and 
the true teachings would be destroyed. 
397. Those who are, through defilement, by nature ignorant 
revile the deeply-realized and despise their teachings; 
all of which occurs through opinions. Therefore the mind 
should never be confined in the impure prison of 
preconception. 
Clean cloth may be dyed with color; never cloth stained by 
oil. 
Since dharma is so valuable, it is very harmful to abandon it. 
One might give up the dharma because of not understanding 
the nature of things as they actually are and therefore have 
contempt for the teachings. This happens because individuals 
are so attached to and involved with their own ideas that they 
Benefits of the Text 417 
can never change their mind. For example, one can dye aclean 
piece of cloth any color, but if it is stained by grease, one can 
never dye it properly. In the same way, if the mind is clouded 
by fixed views even though it is exposed to the dharma, it will 
not be open to new ideas. This is an indirect cause for 
abandoning dharma. 
398. Through lesser understanding, lack of aspiration for 
virtue, indulging in wrong pride, 
a nature veiled by neglecting the dharma, 
mistaking the expedient meaning for the absolute -thatness, 
greed's thirst, ideology's grip, the influence of truth despisers, 
stayingfar from holders of the teachings and lower 
aspiration, thus is the doctrine of 'the defeaters of the enemy' 
abandoned. 
There are ten key causes for rejecting the dharma. 
1. Lesser understanding. A more direct cause of not making 
spiritual progress is a flawed intelligence. One does not 
understand the nature of phenomena. 
2. Lack of aspiration for virtue. Another is the absence of an 
aspiration to experience the good. Without this aspiration there 
is no wish to help other beings or to do anything good. When 
this aspiration is absent, everything becomes polluted and wrong 
views are generated, such as the view that the dharma should 
be abandoned. 
3. Indulging in wrong pride. One may have great pride, 
boasting of qualities one doesn't possess. 
4. A nature veiled by neglecting the dharma. One may not 
have been exposed to dharma in a previous life and practiced 
very little and as a.result is quite heavily obscured by ignorance. 
5. Mistaking the expedient meaningfor the absolute. The next 
condition that prevents spiritual development is the ignorance 
418 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
that confuses the expedient meaning of the Buddha's teaching 
with the absolute meaning or vice versa. 
In addition, there are the five causes related to damaging 
associations. 
6. Greedy thirst. Longing for financial gain, prestige or 
power. 
7. Ideology's grip. The power of rigid preconceptions, such 
as religious beliefs or political views. 
8. The influence of truth despisers. Associating closely with 
those who reject the dharma. 
9. To stray from those holding the teachings. Avoiding those 
who hold the teachings. 
10. Lower aspiration. One has a low level of aspiration and 
enjoys things that contradict the dharma. 
From these, the teachings of the Buddha are likely to be 
abandoned. This is why one should understand these and try 
to eliminate them. 
399. More than fire, cruel poisonous snakes, 
murderers and lightning 
should the wise fear the loss of these profound teachings. 
Fire, snakes, enemies and thunderbolts only bring life to 
an end. 
They do not take one to the fearsome state of worst torment. 
Those who understand the dharma need not fear fire, venomous 
snakes, murderers, or lightning. One should instead fear the 
loss of dharma because fire, snakes, murderers, etc., can only 
threaten one's life, but the loss of the dharma produces the 
terrible suffering of the lower realms and the suffering of 
samsara. Therefore the loss of the teachings is more dangerous 
than anything else. 
Benefits of the Text 419 
400. Even one who, through repeated association with evil 
friends, has had harmful intentions towards the Buddha 
or who commits the most heinous acts of killing 
father, mother or an arhat or who creates divisions in the 
noble sangha will be quickly rid of such things once sincerely 
reflecting upon this true nature: how could there be 
liberation for one whose mind hates dharma! 
If one associates very closely with friends who encourage one 
to do what is wrong, then very unpleasant things will develop. 
Under this negative influence one may wish to kill the Buddha 
or kill one's own father, mother, or an arhat. One may also try 
to create a division among the sangha. These are the worst 
possible actions and are called the five actions of immediate 
result, which means that when one dies, one falls immediately 
into the worst possible realm. These are actions which are even 
more damaging, but even if one becomes involved in these 
activities and then realizes how damaging they are, one may 
use the four remedial powers 70 to purify oneself and even reach 
liberation. So even these five terrible damaging ~ctivities will 
not produce such negative results if one is capable of purifying 
them. However, if one has an improper understanding of the 
dharma and dislikes it strongly, in the short term, the result 
may not be so damaging, but in the long-term it could be very 
dangerous. One will remain involved with outer things, will 
not be able to experience one's own good qualities and may 
embark on the wrong path. Until one has given up such 
misunderstanding of the dharma, one will never be able to 
reach liberation. If one never thinks in terms of reaching 
liberation, then one will never get there. This attitude then is 
more damaging than committing the five actions of immediate 
results because if this attitude is maintained there is no 
prospect of ever obtaining liberation. This is why we must be 
420 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
careful of those who dislike the dharma and those who hold 
wrong views. 71 
Dedication 
401. Whatever virtue I acquire through having properly 
explained these seven points -the jewels, the perfectly-pure 
essence, immaculate enlightenment, its qualities and 
Buddha activity -
through it, may beings see the Sage of Boundless Life, 
he endowed with limitless light. Having seen him, 
once their stainless dharma eyes are opened, 
may they then achieve supreme enlightenment. 
The dedication is a wisdom prayer to Amitayus and is also a 
summary of the whole text. It begins with the prayer that 
whatever virtue Maitreya has obtained through explaining these 
seven vajra points may all beings be able to meet Amitayus, 
who is the Sage of Boundless Life and is endowed with limitless 
life. To see him in his sambhogakaya form provides the short­
term benefit of having long life and in the long-term the benefit 
of the ability to achieve perfect enlightenment once one's 
dharma eyes have been opened. 
402. On what basis, for which reasons, in which way, 
that which has been explained and those things in harmony: 
these have been taught by means of the stanzas four. 
The following is a recapitulation of this concluding chapter on 
the benefits of the text. The line "on what basis" refers to the 
first two lines of verse 392 stating the text was composed on 
the basis of both the words of the Buddha and that of logical 
Benefits of the Text 421 
reasoning. The two lines of this stanza answer the question 
"for which 
reasons," those being in order to purify oneself and 
to help other beings reach Buddhahood. The question "in which 
way" is answered in stanza 393 which states that this set of 
teachings was given by relying on the teachings of the Buddha 
and on Maitreya's understanding. This was explained by 
employing the example of the necessity of using light to have 
the eyes see something properly. "That which has been 
explained" refers to stanza 394 which explains how a true 
Buddhist teaching may be recognized and to stanza 395 which 
defines the shastras. 
403. Two have shown the means for purifying oneself, 
then the causes for the loss and, through two stanzas, 
an explanation of the result. 
Next the means for purifying oneself are explained. One 
shouldn't alter any of the Buddha's teachings and one should 
practice them properly and as fully as is possible (referring to 
stanzas 396 and 397). It then refers to the causes for the loss of 
dharma (stanza 398) and the results of this loss (stanzas 399 
and 400). The immediate result is being reborn in a .lower state, 
the ultimate result being that one is deprived of the possibility 
of liberation for a long time. 
404. In brief the twofold result has been explained 
in what is said in the last one: the surrounding mandala, 
forbearance and the attainment of enlightenment. 
The las't stanza of the text refers to the dedication (stanza 401) 
and explains the short-term and long-term fruition. Through 
practice and dedication to virtue one can be born in the mandala 
of the Buddha~ see the sambhogakaya aspect of the Buddha, 
422 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
and therefore be able to understand the true nature of 
phenomena that leads to the achievement of supreme 
enlightenment. This shows that if one attains the relative level 
of enlightenment of a bodhisattva, one is in the company of 
the sambhogakaya Buddha and once the dharma eyes are 
opened, one achieves the ultimate level of enlightenment.

Summary 
As Buddhists we must follow the path outlined by the Buddha. 
We have to practice according to what the Buddha taught in 
the sutras and the tantras and we should understand them just 
as they are. However, the sutras were sometimes taught as 
answers to a question of a particular disciple or in response to 
a particular situation. For this reason the sutras were quite 
difficult to understand because some passages are extremely 
clear and others less clear. Also a sutra would specialize in a 
particular topic so if one wanted to know the general concepts 
of Buddhism, one had to read sutras scattered throughout 
various books. This is why most Buddhists in Tibet resorted to 
studying the shastras. These made the deeper meaning of 
Buddha's words more accessible and they didn't change the 
meaning of the dharma. This is why the shastras were so 
extremely important. 
The Uttaratantra was composed by Maitreya who is no 
ordinary being. He is a representative of the Buddhas and will 
be the next Buddha in our world. One could not find a more 
Benefits of the Text 423 
qualified author. The Uttaratantra was translated from Sanskrit 
to Tibetan by the great scholar Sadzana who was a grandson of 
the Brahmin Ratnavajra, who was born in the "City of Glory'' 
which we believe is the city of Shrinagar (Kashmir). It was also 
translated in that same "City of Glory'' by the Tibetan monk 
Loden Sherab.

NOTES 
1. The Uttaratantra is called the Ratnagotravibhaga in Sanskrit and is 
a commentary on the Dharanirajesvara sutra. It is actually 
composed of two different parts. First there are the root verses 
that came from Maitreya when Asanga visited the pure realm of 
Tushita and received these from Maitreya, the next Buddha. The 
second part is a commentary on these verses that was written by 
Asanga and is in prose. Together these make up several hundred 
pages and both of these may be found in Takasaki's A Study of 
the Ratnagotravibhaga. The Tibetans translated this text as the 
Uttaratantra, which is the second part of its title. We include the 
root verses translated from the Tibetan (not the Sanskrit) by 
Ken and Katia Holmes and replaced Asanga's commentary with 
a lengthy three month teaching Thrangu Rinpoche did on this 
text at Samye Ling in Scotland in 1979. Thrangu Rinpoche used 
a commentary by Jamgon Kongtrul (Lodro Thaye, 1813-1899), 
which has not been translated into English, for the basis of this 
exposition. The root verses were published separately by Ken 
and Katia Holmes in Maitreya on Buddha Nature. Part ofJamgon 
Kongtrul's commentary has been translated in Hookham's The 
Buddha Within. 
2. The teachings given by the Buddha were written down by his 
closest disciples after his paranirvana. These form the Buddhist 
canon, consisting of Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma and Tantra. This 
is an enormous volume of work consisting of over one hundred 
volumes. In order to explain difficult topics and to draw together 
various aspects of instructions from this vast body of literature 
428 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
great Buddhist masters have written treatises or shastras from 
the original teachings of the Buddha. 
3. Maitreya will be the future Buddha, the fifth of this fortunate age. 
4. The five branches of extraordinary knowledge are: interdependence, 
healing, language, logic, and inner knowledge. The five branches 
of ordinary knowledge are: grammar, terminology, poetry, 
dramatic art, and astrology. 
5. In the Manjusrimalatantra it is predicted that a monk called Asanga 
would be learned in the scriptures of absolute and relative truths. 
He would be renowned as a great master who would compose 
treatises, in particular a concise explanation of the Buddha­
essence in order for it to endure in this world and that he would 
live for 150 years. 
6. There are two kinds of selflessness -the selflessness of other, that 
is, the emptiness of external phenomena and the selflessness of a 
self, that is, the emptiness of a personal sel£ The selflessness of 
the person asserts that when we examine or look for the person, 
we find that it is empty and without self The person does not 
possess a self (Skt. atman, Tib. bdag-nyid) as an independent or 
substantial self Most Buddhist schools hold this position. 
The selflessness of phenomena doctrine asserts than not only 
is there the selflessness of the person, but when we examine outer 
phenomena, we find that external phenomena are also empty, 
i.e. they do not have an independent or substantial nature. This 
position is not held by the Hinayana (shravaka and 
pratyekabuddha) schools, but is put forth by the Mahayana 
schools. 
Selflessness, in the writings of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, 
is called egolessness. One-fold egolessness is the equivalent of 
the selflessness of persons. One-and-a-half-fold egolessness is the 
selflessness of persons plus the lack of inherent existence of 
phenomena; while two-fold egolessness is the selflessness of 
Notes 429 
persons, the lack of inherent existence of phenomena, plus the 
lack of inherent existence of consciousness. In Thrangu 
Rinpoche's rendering here, the selflessness of phenomena includes 
both halves of the second fold of egolessness. 'The view presented 
by Trungpa Rinpoche was the view of Maitreya, and hence 
belongs to the Shentong view; whereas, in the context of analytical 
meditation it is presented by way of the Rangtong view of Masters 
Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti. In the latter view, since phenomena 
exist only in dependence upon the consciousness that perceive 
them, and consciousness exists only in dependence on the 
phenomena they perceive, it is nonsensical to discuss or categorize 
them as though they were independent entities. 
7. Not realizing that the nature of our mind is emptiness we 
consequently fail to recognize it. We then falsely fabricate the 
notion that a self exists of its own accord and cling to it as a 
solid entity. At the same time, the mind possesses the aspect of 
unobstructed lucidity. Failing to recognize' the unobstructed clear 
aspect of the mind, we think other things exist and cling to them 
as distinct and real. Having generated the assumption that self 
and other truly exist of their own accord, attachment and aversion 
evolve-attachment arising from closeness, aversion arising from 
a feeling of distance. Attachment brings forth grasping toward 
what or whom we are attached to and aversion against what or 
whom we dislike. Dualistic concepts evolving from not 
recognizing the empty and clear nature of the mind arise from 
attachment and aversion. We need to cut through clinging to 
this duality. 
Since we cling to the duality of a self and other, we grasp at all 
experiences and things as concrete and abstract existents. We 
need to understand that all experiences and things in and around 
us are a projection of the mind and do not exist unconditionally 
or naturally. Having understood this point, we realize the clear 
aspect of the relative truth. -]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche

8. When hearing of the need to eliminate the belief in a self, many 
people think this refers to a beliefin something that actually exists, 
likeattachment to something really there. In fact, it's not. It is the 
habit of misconceiving that which is not a self to be a self. It is the 
habit of believing in something that is in fact not there. Ultimately, 
from that point of view, there is nothing really to abandon in a 
sense of a thing that can be thrown away. In the realization of 
egolessness or selflessness, there is nothing that actually has to be 
thrown away, rather it is the recognition of what has always been 
the case. Although people accept the view of the non-existence of 
a self, it is not the same as having actually realized selflessness. 
Selflessness can only be realized through practice. And realization 
consists of the eradication of the habit, not just the belief, of viewing 
things as a sel£ -]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
9. This is the translation of the Tibetan word salwa which is also 
translated ~ariously as "brilliance," "clarity," and "luminosity." 
We must not make the mistake of thinking of this as some kind 
of light such as we get from a light bulb even though the words 
suggest this. Rather it is simply that continuous awareness, that 
knowing, that the mind always has. 
10. Fully enlightened beings, Buddhas, and their manifestations are 
often understood by way of the three kayas: the dharmakaya is 
enlightenment itself, wisdom beyond any reference point which 
can only be perceived by other enlightened beings; the 
sambhogakaya, often called the enjoyment body, manifests in 
the pure lands which can only be seen by advanced bodhisattvas; 
and the nirmanakaya which can be seen by ordinary beings as in 
the case of the historical Buddha, but this can also be any type 
of being or relative appearance to assist ordinary beings. 
11. Many people think that the way to avoid suffering is to avoid the 
situations of suffering. This doesn't work because suffering is 
not a cause of itself, rather suffering is a result. It is not suffering 
that is to be intentionally avoided but the cause of suffering and 
Notes 431 
the cause of suffering is karma, the imprints of actions and the 
kleshas or "emotional afflictions." It is for this reason the Buddha 
taught the first noble truth: the truth of suffering is that which 
is to be known. He taught the second noble truth: the truth of 
the cause of suffering is that which is to be avoided. In other 
words, as long as mental afflictions and non-virtuous actions 
have not been abandoned, suffering will not cease. -jamgon 
Kongtrul Rinpoche 
12. The three realms are:' the desire realm (this includes the six realms 
of hells, craving spirits, animals, humans, demi-gods and gods), 
the form realm (gods of subtle form), and the formless realm 
(beings in high meditative states of absorption). 
13. The verses in the root text are numbered as they appear in the 
Sanskrit. The Tibetan text does not have any numbering. The 
Tibetan translation follows the Sanskrit almost exactly, except 
for two places where the Tibetans added an extra verse. 
14. They are called "abodes" because absolute truth -primordial 
wisdom -abides in each. 
15. There are two categories of obscurations or defilements that cover 
one's Buddha-essence: the emotional affiictions or obscuration of 
the disturbing emotions (the three root afflictions are ignorance, 
desire and aggression), and the more subtle obscurations known 
variously as the defilement of latent tendencies, the obscuration 
of dualistic perception, or the cognitive obscurations (seeing the 
world from the perspective of a "self" and what is "other"). The 
,first category prevents sentient beings from freeing themselves from 
sam.sara, while the second prevents them from gaining accurate 
knqwledge and realizing truth. 
16. Tibetan commentaries employ a particular way of counting which 
incorporates the identity of a group as well as those of its 
constituent parts. Thus the three qualities of benefit for oneself, 
432 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
as a whole, are added to the three specific qualities to make four 
qualities. Likewise there are four qualities for benefit of others. 
This system of numbering is given in lists at the end of the first 
three vajra points. The numbers.in front are the six-quality 
method and the numbers behind the qualities are for the eight­
quality method. 
17. The general Buddhist term for wisdom is "prajna." The term 
prajna includes in one term the notions of knowledge, wisdom, 
and primordial awareness or transcendental awareness, which is 
the highest form of prajna. Worldly knowledge -medicine, 
literature, business management, economics or anthropology -
is one form of prajna. Knowledge of the teachings of the Buddha 
and other enlightened beings is spiritual prajna. Both worldly 
and spiritual prajna are based on the acquisition of information, 
and though they may have a great deal of practical benefit, they 
will not by themselves liberate one from the root causes of 
suffering. Only the highest form of prajna, jnana -primordial 
awareness, which is liberated from the superimposition on 
experience of perceiver and perceived -will free one from the 
root causes of suffering. 
18.21,000 teachings on the Vinaya, 21,000 on the Sutra, 21,000 on 
the Abhidharma, and 21,000 in their combination. Their purpose 
is to eliminate the 84,000 types of disturbing emotions latent in 
one's mind. 
19. The Buddhist view is a view free from false notions concerning 
the two extreme assumptions: believing things exist forever or 
of their own accord, and believing that things do not exist at all; 
eternalism and nihilism. This does not mean that a system of 
belief is the foundation for Buddhism, rather, freedom from the 
extreme views means seeing things as they are. Freedom from 
nihilism doesn't mean believing in eternal existents and freedom 
from eternalism doesn't mean believing nothing exists whatsoever. 
Notes 433 
The Buddhist view is free of both false assumptions. The correct 
view must apply and accord with practice, where no contradiction 
is ascertained. -]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
20. Dharmadhatu and dharmakaya are essentially the same; they are 
two indivisi~le aspects of the same thing. The dharmakaya 
emphasizes the wisdom aspect while dharmadhatu emphasizes 
the emptiness aspect. 
21. What is important to understand here is that it is not the objects 
of our experiences themselves which are transformed or changed. 
In fact, both from the sutra and tantra approach, there is nothing 
wrong with the objects of our experiences -they are neither 
pure nor impure, but are only what they are. The impurity in 
our experiences does not come from the objects of our experiences 
but from the way in which we perceive them; because of the 
presence of clinging to a self and to duality, we perceive the world 
in a certain way -we perceive the objects of experience to be 
independent, to be permanent, to be substantial. So, when we 
talk about impure appearances, we are really referring to the lack 
of accuracy in our perception of the world. It is this lack of 
clarity, this lack of accuracy, which we seek to eliminate. -]amgon 
Kongtrul Rinpoche 
22. The root of all habitual tendencies is the erroneous idea that the 
self exists as an "I" although it lacks true existence. Failing to 
realize that all things are empty, one identifies the apprehending 
consciousness as a self; failing to realize that all things are empty, 
one identifies the apprehended objects of mind's clarity as other. 
:The fundamental delusion is failing to realize the inseparability 
of the two truths or the inseparability of emptiness and 
lum~nosity. Clinging to a self, which is empty, and to other, which 
is clarity, is the habit bringing on delusory attachment to the 
notion of a self and aversion to the notion of others. Reactions 
arise in reliance upon attachment and aversion and emotional 
conflicts ensue. As a result, you develop a personal history of 
434 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
karmic patterns. Indulging in emotions that come from 
attachment and aversion, the causes for suffering increase and 
the effects are expanded. -]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
23. There is always a great deal of discussion of karma in the Buddha's 
teachings, we often think of it as something physical because it 
is defined as "action." But, karma is simply the placing of habits 
in the mind. The habit or imprint left by actions produces 
uninterrupted experiences of samsara, like the cups in the wheels 
of a watermill. This is what is meant by the term "karma," 
"action"; karma is the maturation of experiences on the basis of 
the imprints of former actions. 
Of course, at the time of the creation of karma, it is created 
through actions ofbody, speech, and mind, as can be seen in the 
list of the ten virtuous and non-virtuous actions carried out from 
a mental intention. Nevertheless, the imprint or habit rests in 
the mind, )10t in the body. If karma were a physical thing, one 
could easily throw it away and thus eradicate non-virtuous karma 
and gather virtuous karma instead. It is not the case that karma 
is something physical, rather it is a habit that is generated in the 
mind of the person who performs actions, the reason it is 
somewhat difficult to purify or eliminate. Should karma be 
physical and reside in one's body, then at death karma would 
end. However, as one's karma resides in one's mind as a habit 
one can't get rid of it through physical death. Therefore, as long 
as the basis for the accumulation of habits -which is the false 
apprehension of one's experience of an apprehending subject and 
apprehended objects -is not relinquished or liberated, one will 
never be free of suffering. 
Ultimately speaking, the accumulated karma and the 
accumulator of karma are not separate, rather they are non-dual. 
When we speak of karma, we are speaking about something that 
appears in the face of confusion for a confused perceiver. Whether 
karma is virtuous or not, it is accumulated on the basis of the 
apprehension of duality. The final result ofliberation or the state 
of omniscience is liberation from the imprints of both virtuous 
Notes 435 
and non-virtuous karma. Karma is a phenomenon that is present 
in the experience of a confused consciousness. It can be said that 
ultimately there is no accumulator of karma or accumulated 
karma. -]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
24. To go over the process by which this takes place very briefly: We 
find ourselves clinging to a sense of a self, but in truth we cannot 
really establish an actual self present. The notion of a self is 
basically an expression of the various psychophysical constituents, 
called the five skandhas in Buddhism. Based on the skandhas, 
we find the propensity to interpret experience in terms of subject 
and object, i.e., we grasp at external objects as though they exist 
in themselves and at our own sense of a self as something that is 
present and perceives external objects. From that duality, mind's 
natural activity manifests as disturbing emotions (defilements), 
for example, as anger against those things or persons which or 
who undermine our sense of a self, or, as attachment for those 
things or persons which or who support our sense of a sel£ 
We talk about the three mind poisons in Buddhism. The 
fundamental poison is ignorance, not understanding what we 
are. Not understanding what we are gives rise to the sense of 
ourselves as somebody, the basis for attachment and aversion. 
Ignorance, attachment, and aversion are the three poisons that 
become stimulations. They motivate us to act in various ways, 
which is what karma, the truth that every action brings about an 
effect, really means. The effect of all actions establishes certain 
propensities or tendencies within us. This process is what karma 
in truth means. 
Karma describes the way our mind operates, the way we 
ourselves operate and function. Karma is the propensity, the 
habitual patterns which determine our lives. This makes it very, 
very difficult to become free of the effects of our actions because 
they are tendencies established in our mind, in our hearts. -
]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
436 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
25. In order to experience ultimate freedom from suffering and 
confusion, which is true happiness, we must first win insight 
into the fundamental nature of all things. The Buddha taught 
that this insight is the view which cognizes the inseparability of 
the two truths, the relative and absolute. The relative truth 
concerns how things appear to us or how we perceive the world. 
The relative is true because it can be perceived, it can be known. 
The absolute truth concerns valid investigation of our perceptions 
and insight into the true nature of what appears to us. 
Buddhism doesn't teach that the relative and absolute truths 
are distinct, rather that we fabricate distinctions due to our 
divided thoughts. Attachment actually causes us to separate the 
relative from the absolute. Every relative truth we perceive is 
experienced from our confused state of mind. Our particular 
problem is that we are tremendously fixed on the relative truth 
and see it as the only truth. Other than the relative truth, we 
don't see anything. Should we accept an absolute truth, we see it 
as separate and distinct from the relative. We accept that 
phenomena exist without any ands or buts. The Buddha never 
negated relative reality but showed that all things exist in 
interdependent origination. He taught that whatever appears to 
a perceiving mind does so ~ue to the fact that all things lack 
independent existence. The truth of relative reality is the fact 
that all things exist in interdependence; the truth of ultimate 
reality is the fact that all things lack true existence. Both truths 
are saying the same thing from what is intellectually experienced 
as a different point. But, this is just distinguished for the benefit 
of understanding, while the two truths are in fact not different. 
Although we perceive dualistically, everything is pervaded by 
the ultimate truth and never separated from it. Things only 
seem separated from our confused outlook. We need to know 
that the relative truth is pervaded by the absolute truth. The 
absolute truth does not negate the way beings perceive the 
relative truth as it appears to them, rather, it means seeing the 
true nature of appearances. 
Notes 437 
We see that the relative and absolute -uu~hs are not 
contradictory nor do they oppose each other; relative reality does 
not obstruct ultimate reality and ultimate reality does not 
obstruct relative reality. Thus, the relative and absolute truths 
are indivisible, the ultimate truth of the ground. The 
inseparability of the relative and absolute truth is in fact the 
absolute truth. 
The purpose and meaning of the indivisibility of the two truths 
or of the twofold realities is realizing that all things which appear 
and are categorized as conventional realities or conventional truth 
are in their own nature without an established entity or without 
inherent existence. This is the ultimate nature. Therefore, the 
two realities have always been integrated and are two aspects of 
one and the same thing. -]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
26. There are three main types of bondage: the defilements (Skt. 
klesha), desire, anger, ignorance, pride, doubt, distorted views 
of reality, along with all their hybrid forms such as narcissism, 
jealousy, hypocrisy, frustration etc; a deluded understanding, built 
of dualistic concepts; and limitations and blockages in 
meditation. These three are intimately related. Through inability 
in meditation, one is unable to rest easily and continuously in 
non-dual absolute truth. In a darkness of ignorance, all sorts of 
confused dualistic perceptions and ideas occur. It is through them 
that desires, aversions and all the other grosser pollutions develop. 
-Ken Holmes 
27. Illusion is to misperceive, it is not hallucination. According to 
the Buddhist teachings, a lot of what we perceive is illusory, 
because we misperceive. It's not that we perceive nothing .. In 
this classic example given over and over in Buddhist literature, 
mi_staking a rope for a snake, to impute a snake image onto the 
rope is not real, but that does that change the fact that there is a 
rope there. The rope is there. Similarly, we have to see everything 
as an illusion because we misperceive things and these 
438 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
misperceptions just reinforce our delusory states of mind and 
encourage the illusory perceptions to continue.- Traleg Rinpoche 
28. What we call illusion has nothing to do with appearances as 
such. Illusion refers to delusory concepts about appearances and 
the resulting act of clinging. Illusion doesn't mean there is 
something wrong, rather you can call illusion "habitual patterns." 
This is the reason why it is so difficult to become free. If illusion 
were an apparent existent, it could easily be eliminated. 
Unfortunately, illusion is habit and habits can only be slowly 
overcome. You have to overcome habitual patterns, the reason 
why it takes so long to reach enlightenment. -]amgon Kongtrul 
Rinpoche 
29. The realized sangha are relatively close to the Buddhas' 
unsurpassable qualities of wisdom and liberation. Their definite, 
lasting awar.eness of the true nature makes their path irreversible. 
Thus they are truly the finest of all the sangha refuges and 
excellent friends and guides for beings lost in confusion and 
suffering. -Ken Holmes 
30. This entire chapter is about what is called in Sanskrit 
tathagatagarbha, which is a very complex word, usually translated 
as Buddha nature. The syllable tathagata is a common phrase 
used for the Buddha. The Sanskrit word gharbha can mean a 
variety of things, " womb" or "a germ" (of a seed) where 
something is created or grows out o£ This was translated by 
Takasaki as "matrix" because matrix in Latin means "womb," 
and is "something within which something else originates or 
develops" (Merriam-Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary). The 
word garbha also means the "essence" or the "essential nature" 
which gives us the phrase "Buddha-essence" or essence of the 
Buddha. 
The Tibetans translated tathagatagarbha as der sheg nying po 
in which nyingpo means "essence" or "essential nature" so we 
Notes 439 
have chosen to use "Buddha-essence" as the main translation for 
this word. The Tibetan word nyingpo has sense of the "inner 
core" or "germ" also. 
The word "nature" as in the nature of something comes from 
the beginning of Western philosophy in which, for example, 
Aristotle postulated that everything had an essential nature such 
as fire has the nature of hot and burning. This is different from 
appearances and a more modern view would be that water appears 
as hard and solid (ice), flowing and liquid (water) and as a vapor 
(steam), but its essential nature would be more like two atoms 
of Hydrogen and one atom of Oxygen. 
31. The word "liberation" is generally used to define the state of 
being free from the cycle of samsara. This occurs when one has 
removed the emotional obscurations, such as desire, anger etc, 
however subtle obscurations still remain. This state is 
accomplished by arhats and eighth level bodhisattvas. The term 
"Buddhahood" or "enlightenment," is used to distinguish the 
complete and final realization of a Buddha. 
The liberation or nirvana of an arhat is not the final nirvana. 
Their nirvana is a state of unafflicted meditative concentration 
that they believe to be nirvana. One may wonder why the Buddha 
taught such paths. The answer is that such paths are taught to 
help beings that would be discouraged and frightened by the 
path to Buddhahood, they believe accomplishing Buddhahood 
is a great hardship. So, for those not interested in entering this 
path or who would otherwise turn back, the Buddha taught the 
shravaka and pratyekabuddha paths as a sort of intermediatery 
step. Once they have reached this stage and are well rested the 
Buddha encourages them on to the final goal of Buddhahood 
advising them that their nirvana is not the final one. 
32. Traditionally the notion of revulsion is the aversion to samsaric 
existence that arises with the growing perception of the inevitable 
sufferings of conditioned existence. When one's understanding 
of impermanence leads one to conclude that even the transitory 
440 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
happiness and pleasures of conditioned existence inevitably 
deteriorate and disappear -and that because of our clinging to 
them, this process is of the nature of suffering- then one's mind 
develops deep aversion to and revulsion for conditioned existence 
and begins to seek liberation from it. -Lama Tashi Namgyal 
33. There are many explanations of the personal self that we grasp 
at, but basically a person is the combination of awareness and 
the continuity of the afflicted aggregates. This continuity is always 
moving and fluctuating about. Believing this person to be a 
permanent and unique entity we cling and become attached to 
it as "I" and "self." This is the personal self or mind. From this 
comes the disturbing emotions that produce karma (virtuous, 
non-virtuous and neutral) and the result is suffering. It is however 
important to understand that what is being negated is a true, 
permanent and ultimate existence of a self, not the relative self 
or personality. This is why it is compared to dreams and illusions, 
because while having no true existence, they do appear on the 
relative level due to circumstances and certain conditions. 
34. All-pervasive suffering is clinging to duality due to conditioned 
mental habits. This is a universal type of suffering inherent in 
the very process of samsara. There is the constant threat of change 
running through conditioned life. This is what is described as 
the innate suffering of the process of existence. The suffering of 
change is that all joyful experiences inevitably expire and turn 
into the suffering of change or loss. Immediate suffering is all 
experienced physical and mental pain (the suffering of suffering). 
35. Dualistically conceiving mind's manifestations as independent 
existents and the perceiver as distinct is the root cause for 
experiencing the suffering cyclic existence entails. Samsara arises 
and operates due to this dividedness. We automatically seek 
pleasure and shun pain, thus giving birth to attachment and 
aversion. The three basic emotions (ignorance, attachment and 
Notes 441 
aversion) bring forth further afflictions that determine our 
behavior. Wholesome and unwholesome activities evolve, leaving 
an imprint in the ground consciousness. These imprints are stored 
within our mind to ripen into new experiences when conditions 
are appropriate. -]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
36. We divide the relative from the ultimate and automatically cling 
to a mentally contrived distinction. The reason we play off 
samsara against nirvana is because we perceive falsely and 
apprehend both states as distinct. In truth, the relative and 
ultimate are singular in their indivisibility and were never divided 
other than in our cognition. - ]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
37. This type of compassion is directed towards those who think 
that they are suffering although their suffering has no reality. 
The nature of suffering is not real; the very essence of sufferipg 
is emptiness. This is why it can be eliminated. This is the 
compassion of Buddhas and bodhisattvas who know that the 
nature of suffering is delusory but at the same time see that beings 
believe they are experiencing real suffering. 
38. This is the power of miracles, enabling the body to be multiplied 
and transformed into all sorts of appearances of the five elements 
for the benefit of others. 
39. Although translated as "space" this refers to the element of either 
which is the substance that pervades everything in Aristotelian 
mechanics. 
40. See dhatu and ayatanas in the glossary of terms. 
41. Fire is a great destroyer. The fire element even has the meaning 
of destruction, as it indicates the release of potential- of storc;d 
energy -which inevitably causes change of state. Thus the 
example here is fire, which is taken as a metaphor for the 
442 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
sufferings of ageing, sickness and death, which regularly destroy 
life's happiness. -Ken Holmes 
42. In Buddhist and Indian cosmology the inception of a universe is 
described as beginning with wind moving in space, and creating 
water, and the wind subsequently churning the water to produce 
earth. However the real meaning of these elements must be 
considered. Wind is movement in space which produces various 
degrees of gravity, water is bonding and attraction that gives rise 
to density and mass (earth). The subsequent stored energies and 
their potential is the element fire. This more or less accords with 
modern physics. Thus ancient representations of the universe 
show the earth mandala resting on the water mandala which 
itself rests on the wind mandala. All of which takes place in 
space.-Ken Holmes 
43. This highlights the Buddhist concept of action, in which not 
only the initial action itself, but also its longer-term consequences 
are considered together to be one action, one karma. It is very 
easy for an observer to think of causes and their consequences as 
two separate things rather than as one ongoing process. When, 
for instance, one sees the seeds being sown in the field in autumn, 
it is one thing. The green shoots of spring look like another 
thing, a consequence. In reality, there has been an unbroken 
continuum of events. Likewise, our actions in one life and their 
consequences in another may seem quite distinct, yet there has 
been one continuum. -Ken Holmes 
44. The end of time or destruction by fire refers to one of the ways 
a universe is destroyed, the others being by water and wind. This 
however does not mean total annihilation, it is just part of the 
cyclic process of the formation, abiding, destruction and vacuity 
stages of the countless universes. 
45. The first bodhisattva level begins at the path of seeing, the 
third of the five paths. The last traces of karma and klesha 
Notes 443 
causing rebirth are eliminated just prior to the first bodhisattva 
level. On the following nine levels (the fourth path) until 
Buddhahood· (the fifth path) the realization of emptiness is 
refined and subtle obscurations are purified. These subtle 
obscurations are still present as habitual thoughts but are not 
strong enough to cause rebirth. 
46. The second path is often described as "the path of unification." 
This isn't a correct translation of the Sanskrit and Tibetan term 
into the English, rather "the path of application" because it means 
the application of the meaning of the path of accumulation to 
the wisdom of the path of seeing. So it should be translated as 
"the path of application." On the path of application, there are 
four levels of experience, called "warmth or getting warm," 
"peak," "patience or forbearance," and the "supreme dharma in 
the world." These are defined in accordance with the experiences 
arising at the respective levels. Once the third level of the path 
of application is achieved, which is patience, there is no falling 
back into what is referred to as "the lower realms of existence." 
In that way, there are distinctions concerning the actual 
experiences before one reaches the path of seeing, between seeing 
dharmata and actually realizing it fully for the first time. You 
could compare it with recognizing somebody and,.knowing that 
same person. You can recognize someone without knowing who 
they are. This example illustrates the distinction between an initial 
experience and actual realization attained on the third path of 
seeing. The dharmakaya is experienced when one enters the third 
path of seeing. At that point, one will never fall back on the 
other two paths but must progress through the path of meditation 
a~d the fifth path beyond training (Buddhahood). -]amgon 
Kongtrul Rinpoche 
47. This can be compared to a fire of half-dry wood, which still 
requires effort to keep it burning brightly. Similarly, bodhisattvas 
prior to the eighth level have a slight on-off quality, due to the 
444 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
mind being more deeply absorbed at some moments than others, 
on account of superficial thought activity. Whereas eighth level 
bodhisattvas deep absorption in mind's true nature is constant 
and undisturbed by conceptual speculation, giving them an 
incessant and powerful radiance of activity to help beings. 
48. Both tenth-level bodhisattvas and perfect Buddhas act in an 
extremely pure way to help beings. This aspect of their 
manifestation is called jay-top in Tibetan, a word which usually 
means post-meditation. When there is no longer any difference 
between meditation and post-meditation, the awareness of 
meditation is carried into everyday activity and the compassionate 
experience of life gives loving warmth to meditation. When 
meditation is no longer a specific act but a non-stop activity, the 
term jay-top comes to refer to the aspect of it which concerns 
helping others, as is the case here. -Ken Holmes 
49. When the completely awakened mind is realized, freedom from 
all conceptual defilements dawns and a bodhisattva 
spontaneously possesses the perfect resources of enlightened 
activities and perfect qualities benefiting others in need. This 
richness manifests in the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya forms. 
Due to their aspiration prayers of bodhichitta, the Buddhas can 
be perceived in reliance upon the karmic inclinations and 
capacities of sentient beings. Due to their prayers, they can 
manifest and be perceived in a specific form due to sentient 
beings' karmic connection, whereas the dharmakaya is changeless. 
Sambhogakaya is the perfect expression endowed with the 
Mahayana teachings. Nirmanakaya is the perfect manifestation 
able to convey the teachings to others appropriately and 
accordingly. The two kayas are the unimpeded manifestations 
of the dharmakaya. Recognition of both forms of manifestation 
depends upon a practitioner's greater or lesser propensities and 
openness to receive profound dharma teachings, and to put them 
into practice. For those with lesser mental inclinations towards 
the Buddhadharma, the dharmakaya spontaneously appears as 
Notes 445 
the nirmanakaya. Higher beings can relate to the sambhogakaya, 
which does not take on a physical form. For the individual who 
has realized the dharmakaya, the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya 
are identical. Differences depend upon the capacities of the 
students to experience the coarse or subtle manifestation. 
In relation to appearance, we need to distinguish, not because 
the two kayas are different but concerning the experience on the 
side of a practitioner. Experiencing enlightened activities from 
the level of sacred outlook is experiencing the sambhogakaya. 
Experiencing enlightened activities from an unenlightened level 
is experiencing the nirmanakaya. In the context of mind, the 
essential emptiness of mind is the dharmakaya. Its natural clarity 
or lucidity is the sambhogakaya. Its unceasing and unimpeded 
dispersal or creation of thoughts and so forth is the nirmanakaya. 
Some people think that the three kayas are like three actual bodies, 
literally, but that\not what is meant by the term "three kayas." 
-]amgon Kongtrul Rinpoche 
50. The four extreme mental limitations are: believing things 
essentially exist, do not exist, both exist and do not exist, and 
neither exist nor do not exist. The eight fabrications or 
complexities are mental formulations that phenomena have such 
attributes as arising and ceasing, being singular or plural, coming 
and going, and being the same or being different. 
51. This verse has been added to the Tibetan version of the root text 
from Asanga's own commentary and explains the reasons linking 
these four sets of points. 
52. Tqere are six realms, or general types of birth one can take. There 
are three lower realms; hell realms, craving spirit realms, and 
animal realms. There are three higher realms: the human realm, 
demigod realm, and god realm. We have for countless lifetimes 
cycled through these different types of birth and will continue 
to do so until we achieve liberation. The human realm is the 
best for dharma practice. 
446 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
53. The many "truly's" in this verse translate the repeated term yang 
dag, which translates the Sanskrit upsarga. These are adverbs 
which carry a superlative meaning giving the action of a verb its 
highest or noblest value. The different yang dag could have been 
translated as "perfectly" or "properly" or "excellently" etc. "Truly" 
fits most of the meanings and furthermore, echoes the notion of 
truth. However, such a translation could be contentious. -Ken 
Holmes 
54. Clear light is often referred to as "lucid clarity." This coiweys 
two notions: "clarity" points to the purity of enlightenment and 
"lucidity" to its primordial wisdom. -Ken Holmes 
55. The two categories of obscurations or defilements that cover one's 
Buddha nature: the defilement of disturbing emotions (emotional 
obscurations) and the cognitive obscurations; The first category 
prevents sentient beings from freeing themselves from samsara 
(liberation), while the second prevents them from gaining 
accurate knowledge and realizing truth (omniscie~ce). 
56. Rinpoche has said that in previous times when karma was much 
better than today, the wish-fulfilling gem was an actual object 
that would produce what one desired. 
~7. "Vimukti" is Sanskrit for total liberation and "kaya'' means 
embodiment. 
58. Although both kayas, the vimuktikaya and dharmakaya, are both 
actually aspects of what is generally called the dharmakaya, here 
they are singled out in order to show clearly which aspect fulfills 
which function of enlightenment and to shoe the value of deep 
meditation and the value of post-meditation. -Ken Holmes 
59. These qualities are called outward because they are more relevant 
to other beings' quest for knowledge about it. 
Notes 447 
60. Mara. (Tib. du) Difficulties encountered by the practitioner. The 
Tibetan word means heavy or thick. In Buddhism mara 
symbolizes the passions that overwhelm human beings as well as 
everything that hinders the arising of wholesome roots and 
progress on the path to enlightenment. There are four kinds: 
skandha-mara, which is incorrect view of self; klesha-mara, which 
is being overpowered by negative emotions; matyu-mara, which 
is death and interrupts spiritual practice; and devaputra-mara, 
which is becoming stuck in the bliss that comes from meditation. 
61. Thoughts and concepts are called "nam-tog in Tibetan, literally 
meaning "thought and concepts" for the only reason that they 
are created by the 
mind. A beginner understands everything in 
the perspective of disturbing emotions due to the differentiation 
of self and other. It is with a sense of duality that one 
conceptualizes all perceptions, which is a creation of a dualistic 
mind, a polluted thought. When one rests in the natural state of 
the mind without clinging to or suppressing arising thoughts, at 
that level, a thought is not defined as "nam-tog' any more, rather 
as "ye-she," "wisdom." Wisdom is freedom from clinging to 
duality. Wisdom is "non-nam-tog," "non-thought," thought as a 
mental contrivance. Any thought free of the disturbing emotions 
of attachment and aversion, especially free of the disturbing 
emotion of dualistic perception, is wisdom. -Traleg Rinpoche 
62. At the first of the five paths, path of accumulation, twelve of the 
thirty-seven branches of enlightenment are practiced: the four 
types of mindfulness (sustaining mindfulness of body, feelings, 
the mind, and phenomena) which occur during the lesser stage, 
the four types of perfect abandonment (abandoning non-virtues 
wnich have been created, not allowing new non-virtues to be 
produced, producing the virtuous remedies not yet present, and 
assuring the increase of those virtues whic~ have already arisen) 
which occur during the middle stage, and the four feet of 
miraculous powers (the absorption of strong aspiration, 
448 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
perseverance, through intention, and investigation) which occur 
during the greater stage of the path of accumulation. 
The path of application follows on from the perfection of the 
path of accumulation. There are four stages that correspond to 
the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. During the first 
two stages there are five powers (five of the thirty-seven branches 
of enlightenment) to be practiced: the power of 1) faith, 2) 
diligence, 3) mindfulness, 4) absorption, and 5) wisdom 
awareness. During the second two stages there are five strengths 
(five of the thirty-seven branches of enlightenment) to be 
practiced: the strength of 1) faith, 2) diligence, 3) mindfulness, 
4) absorption, and 5) wisdom awareness. 
From a basis of calm abiding one gains insight into the Four 
Noble Truths at the third path of seeing. There are four insights 
that, correspond to each of the Four Truths, giving sixteen in 
total. These sixteen are direct realizations of the truth of the 
Four Truths, as opposed to an intellectualized or limited 
understanding of them that we have prior to this stage. At this 
stage one is endowed with seven of the thirty-seven branches of 
enlightenment: the perfect 1) mindfulness branch, 2) 
discrimination branch, 3) diligence branch, 4) joy branch, 5) 
relaxation branch, 6) absorption branch, and 7) equanimity branch. 
At the path of cultivation there are two types of meditation, 
worldly (meaning the result is better worldly rebirth as opposed 
to liberation) and beyond the world. The worldly consists of 
meditative concentrations and formless absorptions; these 
suppress the afflicting emotions, establish the special qualities 
of the four immeasurables and create the foundation for the 
meditation beyond the world. The beyond the world meditation 
consists of furthering tranquility and insight focused on the two 
aspects of primordial wisdom (jnana). At this stage one is 
endowed with eight of the thirty-seven branches of 
enlightenment: .1) perfect view, 2) perfect conception, 3) perfect 
speech, 4) perfect action, 5) perfect livelihood, 6) perfect effort, 
7) perfect mindfulness, and 8) perfect absorption (these are more 
commonly known as the eight-fold right path). 
Notes 449 
63. The Tibetan term for this is dren pa, which means both 
mindfulness and memory. Mindfulness is defined as never losing 
pure intention through forgetting. 
64. Other special beings, such as universal emperors (chakravartin) 
and some highly developed non-Buddhist sages may have some 
or many of the thirty-two major marks. However, these marks 
are the same in name only. The actual details and context of 
each one is different from that of a Buddha, which is far and 
away superior. 
65. It is said to extend beyond even the gods' realms. AJ;, this is 
impossible to portray, artists usually depict it as a large bump on 
the Buddha's head, but this is not how it appears to those who 
see the Buddha. 
66. Narayana refers to the Indian god Vishnu. 
67. Vaidurya is a precious gemstone that has given rise to several 
translations, from the opaque lapis lazuli through beryl to 
sapphire. Vaidurya is mentioned in several Sutras as being the 
substance of one sort of wish-fulfilling gem. In the White Lotus 
and other texts it is said to emerge from the ring. bsrel relics of 
the Buddha. The palace oflndra is made, in part, of vaidurya. It 
is found in the deva or naga realms but not normally in the 
human realm, except by those of exceptional merit.-Ken Holmes 
68. This refers to the absence of the three thoughts, for example 
when giving: when we give something we do not introduce the 
idcras -of someone giving something, of someone receiving the 
gift, and of the action of giving. Once we do not introduce this 
three-fold division, which comes from thoughts and concepts 
then generosity is extremely pure. 
450 The Uttaratantra -A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
69. It is the Tibetan custom that when one receives a religious object, 
one touches it to the top of one's head to receive a blessing 
from it. 
70. Purifying negative actions is done by resorting to four powers: 1: 
The Power of Reliance. This means to reassert one's commitment 
of refuge in the Three Jewels and bodhichitta, by reciting the 
vows. This is the basis that one reaffirms. 2: The Power of 
Renunciation or Abandonment. This is to sincerely regret the 
downfall or violation one has committed. 3: The Power of 
Remedial Action. To engage in some specific method in order to 
repair or counteract the power of the violation. 4: The Power of 
Restoration. It means the attitude of commitment not to commit 
that d~ed again. 
There are three manners in which these four powers can be 
applied. These three ways are essentially three varieties of the 
third one, the remedial conduct. The best one is meditation 
on emptiness. The second best is to use such techniques as the 
Vajrasattva mantra. The third best is to base the confession 
simply on the recollection of the downfall, and confess it using 
the four powers. 
71. Wrong view here refers to three main types: wrong view of cause 
and result (not believing that happiness comes from virtue and 
suffering from non-virtue), wrong view of truth (not believing 
that nirvana is attained even if the truth of the path is practiced), 
wrong view of the Three Jewels (not believing in them and 
slandering them).

Guru. (Tib. lama) A teacher in the Tibetan tradition who has reached 
realization. 
Guru yoga. (Tib. Iamay naijor) A practice of devotion to the guru 
culminating in receiving his blessing and blending indivisibly 
with his mind. Also refers to the fourth practice of the preliminary 
practices of N gondro. 
Habitual patterns. (Skt. vasana. Tib. bakchak) Patterns of conditional 
response that exist as traces or tendencies stored in the alaya­
vijnana, the eighth consciousness sometimes called the store­
house or all-base consciousness. So called because it is a repository 
of all karmically conditioned patterns. All dualistic or ego­
oriented experiences leave a residue, which is stored in the alaya­
vijnana until a later time when some conscious occurrence 
activates the habitual pattern. The pattern then generates a 
response in the form of a perception or an action. This response 
leaves its own karmic residue, stored again in the unconscious 
repository, and the cycle continues. The explanation of this system 
is a central teaching of the Cittamatrin tradition of Mahayana 
Buddhism. 
Hearing lineage. (Tib. nyan gyu) A lineage of instruction passed orally 
from teacher to disciple. Teachings of a hearing lineage are usually 
very secret, since they can only be received by direct, personal

Hinayana. (Tib. tek pa chung wa) Literally, the "lesser vehicle." The 
first of the three yanas, or vehicles. The term refers to the first 
teachings of the Buddha, which emphasized the careful 
examination of mind and its confusion. It is the foundation of 
Buddha's teachings focusing mainly on the four truths and the 
twelve interdependent links. The fruit is liberation for oneself. 
Indra. (Tib. brgua byin) The chief god of the realm of desire and said 
to reside on the top of Mt. Meru. 
Interdependent origination. The twelve links of causal connections 
which binds beings to samsaric existence and thus perpetuate 
suffering: ignorance, karmic formation, consciousness, name and 
form, the six sense bases, contact, sensation, craving, grasping, 
becoming, rebirth, old age, and death. These twelve links are 
like an uninterrupted vicious circle, a wheel that spins all sentient 
beings around and around through the realms of samsara. 
Insight meditation. (Skt. Vipashyana, Tib. lhak tong) This meditation 
develops insight into the nature of reality (Skt. dharmata). One

Karma. (Tib. lay) Literally "action." The unerring law of cause and 
effect, e.g., positive actions bring happiness and negative actions

that create the conditions for rebirth and the circumstances in 
that lifetime. 
Karma Kagyu. (Tib.) One of the eight schools of the Kagyu lineage 
ofTibetan Buddhism which is headed by His Holiness Karmapa. 
Karmapa. The name means Buddha activities. The Karmapas are the 
head of the Kagyu school of Buddhism and were the first to 
implement the tradition of incarnate lamas. Karmapas are 
thought to be an emanation of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. 
Karmic latencies or imprints. (Skt. vasana, Tib. bakchak) Every action 
that a person does has an imprint which is stored in the eighth 
consciousness. These latencies express themselves later by leaving 
the eighth consciousness and entering the sixth consciousness 
upon being stimulated by external experience. 
Kayas, three. (Tib. ku sum) There are three bodies of the Buddha: the 
nirmanakaya, sambhogakaya and dharmakaya. The dharmakaya, 
also called the "truth body," is the complete enlightenment or 
the complete wisdom of the Buddha that is unoriginated wisdom 
beyond form and manifests in the sambhogakaya and the 
nirmanakaya. The sambhogakaya, also called the "enjoyment 
body," manifests only to bodhisattvas. The nirmanakaya, also 
called the "emanation body," manifests in the world and in this 
context manifests as the Shakyamuni Buddha. The fourth kaya 
is the svabhavakakaya, which is the "essence body," the unity of 
the other three. 
Key instructions- a text's key instruction rests upon establishing the 
line of reasoning in a teaching. Seeing this line of reasoning, we 
can distinguish between the form and the content of the 
teachings. What key instructions do are wake a person up to the 
true nature of the experience that the teachings generate, such as 
the dissolving of the objective form of the experience, which can 
462 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
be seen as it truly is, appreciated as having no independent reality 
and hence no power, as would be the case if it existed 
independently. The key instruction that, if acted upon, generates 
a liberating personality transformation, is repeated at each level 
of the teachings. 
King Indrabodhi. An Indian king during the time of the Buddha 
who become an accomplished master. He symbolizes the person 
of the highest calibre who can use sense pleasures as the path of 
practice. 
Klesha. (Tib. nyon mong) Also called the "disturbing emotions," these 
are the emotional afflictions or obscurations (in contrast to 
intellectual obscurations) that disturb the clarity of perception.

Luminosity. (Tib. salwa) In the third turning of the wheel of dharma, 
the Buddha taught that everything is void, but this voidness is 
not completely empty because it has luminosity. Luminosity or 
clarity allows all phenomena to appear and is a characteristic of 
and inseparable from emptiness (Skt. shunyata). 
Luminosity. (Tib. osel) Literally "free from the darkness of unknowing 
and endowed with the ability to cognise." The two aspects are

Luminosity is the uncompounded nature present throughout all 
of samsara and nirvana. 
Madhyamaka. (Tib. u ma) The most influential of the four schools 
oflndian Buddhism founded by Nagarjuna in the second century 
C.E. The name comes from the Sanskrit word meaning ''the 
Middle-way'' meaning it is the middle way between eternalism 
and nihilism. The main postulate of this school is that all 
phenomena- both internal mental events and external physical 
objects- are empty of any true nature. The school uses extensive 
rational reasoning to establish the emptiness of phenomena. This 
school does, however, hold that phenomena do exist on the 
conventional or relative level of reality. 
Mahamudra. (Tib. cha ja chen po) Literally means "great seal" or 
"great symbol" meaning that all phenomena are sealed by the 
primordially perfect true nature. This form of meditation is traced 
back to Saraha (1Oth century) and was passed down in the Kagyu 
school through Marpa. This meditative transmission emphasizes 
perceiving mind directly rather than through rational analysis. 
It also refers to the experience of the practitioner where one attains 
the union of emptiness and luminosity and also perceives the 
non-duality of the phenomenal world and emptiness; also the 
name of Kagyupa lineage.

century and practiced tantra. The biography of some of the most 
famous is found in The Eighty-four Mahasiddhas. 
Mahayana. (Tib. tek pa chen po) Literally, the "Great Vehicle." These 
are the teachings of the second turning of the wheel of dharma, 
which emphasize shunyata (see shunyata), compassion and 
universal Buddha nature. The purpose of enlightenment is to 
liberate all sentient beings from suffering as well as oneself. 
Mahayana schools of philosophy appeared several hundred years 
464 The Uttaratantra- A Treatise on Buddha-Essence 
after the Buddha's death, although the tradition is traced to a 
teaching he is said to have given at Rajgriha, or Vulture Peak 
Mountain. 
Maitripa -was a guru of Marpa, the Tibetan forefather of the Ka.gyu 
lineage. Thus it is through Maitripa that Maitreya and Asanga's 
crucial work on Buddha nature, the Uttaratantrasastra (Anuttara), 
became widely followed in Tibet. It is said that he had been a 
student ofNaropa when the latter was head ofNalanda monastic 
university. Maitripa also transmitted to Marpa the esoteric aspect 
ofBuddha nature embodied in the Mahamudra teachings, which 
treat the topic of mind in great detail and provide a wide range 
of progressive, highly refined meditations. Maitripa was brought 
to enlightenment through Mahamudra under his guru Savari, 
who received the complete teachings of Mahamudra from 
Nagarjuna, who received them from Sahara, whom Marpa

Sanskrit syllables, representing various energies, are repeated in 
different Vajrayana practices. 
Mara. (Tib. du) Difficulties encountered by the practitioner. The 
Tibetan word means heavy or thick. In Buddhism mara 
symbolizes the passions that overwhelm human beings as well as 
everything that hinders the arising of wholesome roots and 
progress on the path to enlightenment. There are four kinds: 
skandha-mara, which is incorrect view of self; klesha-mara, which 
Glossary ofTerms 465 
is being overpowered by negative emotions; matyu-mara, which 
is death and interrupts spiritual practice; and devaputra-mara, 
which is becoming s.tuck in the bliss that comes from meditation.

emotions (see five poisons and emotional obscurations) and the 
defilement of latent tendencies or sometimes called the 
obscuration of dualistic perception, or the intellectual/cognitive

directly with the practice. 
Ordinary Mind. (Tib. tamal kyi shepa) There is no need to do anything 
to your present wakefulness at the moment of recognizing; it is 
already as it is. That is the true meaning of naked ordinary mind, 
a famous term in Tibetan. It means not tampered with. Thee is 
no "thing" which needs to be accepted or rejected; it is simply as 
it is. The term 'ordinary mind' is the most immediate and accurate 
term to describe the nature of mind. No matter what terminology 
is being utilized within the Middle-way, Mahamudra or 
Dzogchen, naked ordinary mind is the simplest term. 
Osel. See luminosity. 
Padmasambhava. (Tib. Guru Rinpoche) Or the "Lotus Born." The 
great 8'h century Indian mahasiddha who came to Tibet taming

knowledge. The Tibetan literally means, "gone to the other side" 
or "gone beyond" as expressed in the prajnaparamita mantra, 
"Om gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha." The realization 
ofemptiness in the Prajnaparamita Hridaya or Heart Sutra made 
possible by the extraordinarily profound dharma of the birth of 
Shakyamuni Buddha in the world and the practices that came 
from it, such as the Vajrayana tantras, which make use of 
visualization and the control of subtle physical energies. 
Prajnaparamita sutras. Used to refer to a collection of about 40

sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya. 
Sacred outlook. (Tib. dag snang) Awareness and compassion lead the 
practitioner to experience emptiness (shunyata). From that comes 
luminosity manifesting as the purity and sacredness of the 
phenomenal world. Since the sacredness comes out of the 
experience of emptiness, the absence of preconceptions, it is 
neither a religious nor a secular vision: that is, spiritual and secular 
vision could meet. Moreover, sacred outlook is not conferred by 
any god. Seen clearly, the world is self-existingly sacred. 
Salwa. See luminosity. 
Samadhi. (Tib. tin ne zin) A state of meditation that is non-dualistic. 
There is an absence of discrimination between self and other. 
Al~o called meditative absorption or one-pointed meditation;

representative of the experiential content of the dharmakaya. 
Samaya. (Tib. dam sig). The vows or commitments made in the 
Vajrayana to a teacher or to a practice. Many details exist but

Sambhogakaya. (Tib. long cho dzok ku) There are three bodies of the 
Buddha and the sambhogakaya, also called the "enjoyment body," 
is a realm of the dharmakaya that only manifests to bodhisattvas 
(see kayas, three). 
Samsara. (Tib. kor wa) "Cyclic existence." The conditioned existence 
of ordinary life in which suffering occurs because one still 
possesses attachment, aggression and ignorance. It is contrasted 
to nirvana. Through the force of karma motivated by ignorance, 
desire and anger one is forced to take on the impure aggregates 
and circle the wheel of existence .until liberation. 
Sangha. (Tib. gen dun) "Virtuous One." Sang means intention or 
motivation and gha means virtuous. One with virtuous

a certain level of realization of the Buddha's teachings. 
Secret mantra. (Tib. sang ngak) A name for the Vajrayana. 
Selflessness. (Tib. dag me) Also called egolessness. In two of the 
Hinayana schools (Vaibhashika and Sautrantika) this referred 
exclusively to the fact that "a person" is not a real permanent 
self, but rather just a collection of thoughts and feelings. In two 
of the Mahayana schools (Cittamatra and Madhyamaka) this 
was extended to mean there was no inherent existence to outside 
phenomena as well. 
Sentient beings. With consciousness; an animated being as opposed 
to an inanimate object. All beings with consciousness or mind 
who have not attained the liberation of Buddhahood. This 
Glossary ofTerms 471

bodhisattvas to remain in cyclic existence and to teach the 
dharma. 6. Beseeching them not to pass away. 7. And dedicating 
the merit that has arisen through our practice that all sentient 
beings attain enlightenment. Paying homage counteracts pride; 
presenting offerings counteracts greed; acknowledging and 
confessing evil acts counteracts aggression; rejoicing in the good 
that others do counteracts jealousy; requesting spiritual teachings 
counteracts stupidity; asking the Buddhas and teachers to remain 
present in the world counteracts the view of permanence; and 
dedicating virtue to the welfare of others leads to the attainment 
of full awakening. 
Seven limbs of awakening. The virtue of faith, insight, samadhi, joy, 
diligence, mindfulness, and equanimity. Externally they are 
represented by the seven articles of royalty.

Shastra. (Tib. tan cho) The Buddhist teachings are divided into words 
of the Buddha (the sutras) and the commentaries of others on 
his works, the shastras. 
Shentong school. The Madhyamaka or Middle-way is divided into 
two major schools; Rangtong (empty of self) and Shentong 
(empty of other). Shentong is from the third turning of the wheel 
of dharina and explains ultimate reality is emptiness and 
luminosity inseparable. 
Shravaka. "Hearer" corresponds to the level of arhat, those that seek 
and attain liberation for oneself through listening to the Buddha's 
teaching and gaining insight into selflessness and the four truths. 
These are the Buddha's speech disciples. 
Shunyata. See emptiness. 
Siddha. (Tib. drup top) An accomplished Buddhist practitioner. 
Siddhi. (Tib. ngodrup) "Accomplishment." The spiritual

or conceptual formations about the nature of things. 2) The 
second stage in the practice of Mahamudra. 
Six paramitas. See paramita.

gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hell beings. 
These are the possible types of rebirths for beings in samsara and 
are: the god realm in which gods have great pride, the jealous 
god realm in which the jealous gods try to maintain what they 
have, the human realm which is the best realm because one has 
the possibility of achieving enlightenment, the animal realm 
characterized by stupidity, the hungry ghost realm characterized 
by great craving, and the hell realm characterized by aggression. 
Skilful means. (Tib. thabs). Generally, upaya conveys the sense that 
enlightened beings teach the dharma skilfully, taking into 
consideration the various needs, abilities, and shortcomings of 
Glossary ofTerms 473 
their students. Upaya is an expression of compassion. In the 
bodhisattva's discipline, it corresponds to the first five paramitas 
and to relative bodhichitta. By prajna alone, without upaya, the 
bodhisattva is fettered to a quietistic nirvana. By upaya without 
prajna, one remains bound to samsara. Therefore the practitioner 
niust unify them. 
In Vajrayana, upaya arises from shunyata. It is joined with 
prajna and represents the male, form aspect of the union of form 
and emptiness. 
Stillness. (Tib. gnas pa) Absence of thought activity and disturbing 
emotions, but with subtle fixation on this stillness. 
Stupa. (Tib. chorten) Objects of offering, or objects for accumulating. 
A stupa is a monument symbolic of the dharmakaya and contains

Buddhahood. Any disrespectful act toward them is disrespect 
for enlightenment itsel£ 
Sugata. An epithet for the Buddha. 
Sugatagarbha. The Buddha nature. 
Sutra. (Tib. do) Literally "Junction." The combination of the 
Hinayana and Mahayana, or the combination of wisdom and 
compassion. Texts in the Buddhist cannon attributed to the 
Buddha. They are viewed as his recorded words, although they 
were not actually written down until many years after his 
paranirvana. They are usually in the form of dialogues between 
the Buddha and his disciples. These are often contrasted with 
the tantras which are the Buddha's Vajrayana teachings and the 
shastras which are commentaries on the words of the Buddha. 
Sutra Mahamudra. (Tib. mdo'i phyag chen) The Mahamudra system 
based on the Prajnaparamita scriptures and emphasizing

Tantra. (Tib. gyu.) Literally, tantra means "continuity," and in 
Buddhism it refers to two specific things: the texts (resultant 
texts, or those that take the result as the pai:h) that describe the 
practices leading' from ignorance to enlightenment, including 
commentaries 
by tantric masters; and the way to enlightenment 
itself, encompassing the ground, path, and fruition. One can 
divide Buddhism into the sutra tradition and the tantra tradition. 
The sutra tradition primarily involves the academic study of the 
Mahayana sutras and the tantric path primarily involves 
practicing the Vajrayana practices. The tantras are primarily the 
texts of the Vajrayana practices. 
Tantra Mahamudra. (Tib. sngags kyi phyag chen) The same as mantra 
Mahamudra. The Mahamudra practice connected to the Six

Ten non-virtuous actions. Killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, 
slander, abusive words, idle gossip, covetousness, ill-will, and 
wrong views. Acts are non-virtuous or unwholesome when they 
result in undesirable karmic effects. Thus, this list of ten 
unwholesome acts occurs generally in discussions of the 
functioning of karma. The first three are actions of body, the 
next four of speech, and the last three of mind. The ten virtuous 
actions are the opposites of the above ten non-virtuous actions. 
Ten stages. The stages or bodhisattva levels in the Mahayana path 
which are: 1) The Joyous One with an emphasis on generosity, 
2) The Stainless One with an emphasis on discipline, 3) The

One with an emphasis on exertion, S) The One Difficult to 
Conquer with an emphasis on samadhi, 6) The Manifest One 
with an emphasis on wisdom, 7) The Far Going One with an 
emphasis on skilful activity, 8) The Unshakeable One with an 
emphasis on future, 9) The One of Good Discrimination with 
an emphasis on efficacy, 1'0) Cloud of Dharma with an emphasis 
on accomplishing enlightenment. In the tantric (Vajrayana) 
Glossary ofTerms 475

three precious ones are objects of veneration and are considered 
"places of refuge." The Buddhist takes refuge by pronouncing 
the threefold refuge formula, thus acknowledging formally to be 
a Buddhist. 
Three poisons. See five poisons. 
Three realms. These are three categories of samsara. The desire realm 
includes existences where beings are reborn with solid bodies 
due to their karma ranging from the deva paradises to the hell

power of meditation; and their bodies are of subtle form in this 
realm. These are the meditation paradises. The formless realm is 
where beings due to their meditation (samadhi), have entered a 
state of meditation after death and the processes of thought and 
perception have ceased. 
Three roots. Guru, yidam and dakini. Guru is the root of blessings, 
yidam of accomplishment and dakini of activity. 
Three sufferings. These are the suffering of suffering, the suffering of 
change, and pervasive suffering (meaning the inherent suffering

CARE OF DHARMA BooKs 
Dharma books contain the teachings of the Buddha. They have 
the power to protect against lower rebirth and to point the way 
to liberation. Therefore, they should be treated with respect. 
These considerations may be also kept in mind for Dharma 
artwork, as well as the written teachings and artwork of other 
religions.
