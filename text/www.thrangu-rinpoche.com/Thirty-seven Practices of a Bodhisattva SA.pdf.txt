 1 Foreword   Over the last forty years Thrangu Rinpoche has given over 170 recorded teachings that were translated into English and published in over 40 books on Buddhism. In these teachings he has given commentaries on basic Buddhist concepts such as the common preliminaries and the Medicine Buddha practice up to complex topics such as The Abhisamaya-lankara.  One of the points Thrangu Rinpoche has repeatedly made in this Buddhist teachings is that no matter how advanced a person’s meditation might be, if he or she conducts themselves poorly all the meditation practice will have been fairly worthless. As another Rinpoche once reminded his students, if we get all involved with all the reasonings and logic in Buddhism, we often forget that the whole purpose of the Buddhist path is simply to become a better person.  Buddhism began with just that thought of how to become a better person 2,500 years ago when the Buddha walked in northern India going from one place to the next preaching to large crowds and telling them how they could live a happier and more loving life and be fulfilled with a noble goal and purpose. Fortunately, his forty years of teachings were memorized by some of his most advanced students who had the incredible ability to remember and recite his teachings. These formed the Foundation Vehicle of Buddhism which was written down hundreds of years later. Several hundred years after this a number of gifted Buddhist scholars and practitioners elaborated on these teachings by developing what we now call the Mahayana Vehicle.   The Mahayana teaching marshalled a great many of the Buddha’s teachings and organized them along with the practice of studying the mind and emphasized that one must develop complete and impartial compassion for others to be

 2 able to develop one’s meditation and reach the final goal of awakening or enlightenment. They developed these ideas by proposing that there was an ideal Buddhist practitioner capable of reaching enlightenment who had to go beyond the magnificent accomplishments of the Foundation Vehicle adepts or arhats. This person was called a bodhisattva and the bodhisattva must aspire to have the extraordinary com-passion to remain in samsara, lifetime after lifetime, until all other sentient beings had reach enlightenment. This com-passion was called “mind of enlightenment” or bodhichitta which was an overwhelming impartial compassion for all sentient beings.  The Mahayana path was mostly taught in large monastic monasteries who invited Foundation practitioners, Hindu philosophers, Vedic scholars, Mahayana practitioners, and many others who came from numerous countries including China, Mongolia, and Tibet.   In the eight century CE an extraordinary monk named Shantideva while studying at the large Nalanda monastic college in Northern India wrote a beautiful, poetic summary of the Mahayana path. This treatise discussed the several kinds of bodhichitta and the six main stages of the bodhisattva path to enlightenment. What made Shantideva’s A Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life was that it was written not in the dry, academic jargon that many treatises at the time were written in, but rather in an easy to understand text sprinkled with examples and metaphors that are still quoted again and again today by Buddhist teachers because of their clarity and simplicity.  Shantideva’s text has been translated now into dozens of languages and Thrangu Rinpoche’s has taught different chapters of this text verse by verse in many different times and places. The text is quite long comprising hundreds of verses and some of his students asked for a shorter teaching on the bodhisattva’s path.  
Foreword 
 3  So Thrangu Rinpoche then taught this text, The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva which has just 37 four-line verses covering how one should behave to be a bodhisattva. This text was written by Ngülchu Togme Zangpo (1297-1371 CE). He was not only a very great scholar who studied and wrote commentaries on teachings from a number of Buddhist lineages of Tibet, but was also extraordinarily compassionate in his daily life especially to the poor and suffering. For example, the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa has written an excellent five-page biography on Ngülchu Thogme Zangpo which has examples of his incredible compassion and abilities as a lama in his Practice of Compassion (see bibliography).  When being a Buddhist, it is difficult to absorb all the original teachings of the Buddha because he lived over 2,500 years ago and because his teachings were, for the most part, discussions with his students about whatever questions that they had. One of the great contributions of the Mahayana vehicle in the early centuries of our era was to lay out the ideal Buddhist practitioner who was a bodhisattva. Bodhisattvas not only studied the teachings and practice meditation, but they also worked actively perfecting their compassion. This compassion, called bodhichitta is impartial so that one develops compassion towards not only towards loved ones and friends but also compassion towards those don’t like or even hate.  The question is how a bodhisattva develops compassion towards all sentient beings (which also includes animals and non-material beings such as spirits and demons) especially in a world which is filled with people who are doing unthinking and harmful things. And finally, how does practicing this compassion lead us to enlightenment. Adzum Rinpoche has said of the importance of compassion, “However far along you are on the path of compassion, that is how far along the path to enlightenment you are.” 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 4   Finally, the Seventeenth Karmapa, Ogyan Trinley Dorje has said of this text on the Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva:   “In Tibet, many great masters from all the lineages have studied, reflected, and meditated on this text, and they have also written commentaries and taught it. The Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva is considered both deep and broad, comprehensive and concise. It includes all the necessary points for understanding the practices of a bodhisattva.”  
 
 5 The Root Text  The Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva by Ngülchu Thogme Translated by Michele Martin  Namo Lokeshvaraya1  (a) To the Ones who see that all phenomena neither   come nor go  And who only seek to benefit sentient beings To the supreme lama and the protector Chenrezig, With respect I bow continually through the three gates.   (b) Perfect Buddhas, source of all benefit and happiness,  Arise through accomplishing the genuine Dharma,  This further depends on knowing the practice, And so the practices of bodhisattvas, will be explained.   1. Having now attained this difficult to find great vessel  of leisure and resources, In order to free yourself night and day without break  From the ocean of samsara, To listen, reflect, and meditate, is the practice of  bodhisattvas.   2. Toward friends, attachment churns like water; Toward enemies, hatred burns like fire. When dark with ignorance, one forgets what to adopt  or reject. To give up this homeland is the practice of bodhisattvas.     1.

 6 3. By abandoning negative places, kleshas gradually decrease.  With no distractions, virtuous activity naturally grows.  Through a clear mind, certainty in the Dharma arises.  To rely on solitude is the practice of bodhisattvas.  4. Close old friends and relatives separate. Material wealth gained with effort is relinquished. The guest, the consciousness, leaves its lodging,  the body behind.  To let go of this life is the practice of bodhisattvas.   5. Make friends with these and the three poisons grow,  The activities of listening, reflecting, and meditating  degenerate, Loving-kindness and compassion are destroyed. To cast off bad friends is the practice of bodhisattvas.   6. Rely on this one and defects disappear; Positive qualities increase like the waxing moon. So, to care for the spiritual friend More than your own body is the practice of bodhisattvas.  7. Bound themselves within the prison of samsara,  Whom could worldly gods protect? Therefore, in seeking protection, to go for refuge In the Three Jewels is the practice of bodhisattvas.   8. The suffering in the lower realms resulting   from negative actions Is so difficult to bear, so the Buddha taught  That even at the risk of your life, Never commit negative actions is the practice   of bodhisattvas.   9. Happiness of the three realms is like dew on the tip of a  blade of grass: Its very nature makes it evaporate in an instant. To strive for the supreme level of liberation That never changes is the practice of bodhisattvas.  
The Root Text 
 7 10. From beginningless time my mothers have cared for me;  If they suffer, what good is my own happiness?  Thus, with the goal of liberating beings without number and To engender bodhichitta is the practice of bodhisattvas.   11. All suffering begins with wanting happiness for yourself.  Perfect Buddhas arise from the intention to benefit others.  Therefore, to fully exchange your happiness For the suffering of others is the practice of bodhisattvas.   12. If someone, out of great desire, seizes all your wealth  Or makes another do so, To dedicate body, possessions, and all virtue of the three times To this person is the practice of bodhisattvas.   13. Though I not having the least fault, Even though my head is severed by others,  To take on their negative deeds with compassion is  the practice of bodhisattvas.   14. Although someone broadcasts throughout the  triple universe A legion of slander about you, In return, with a mind full of loving-kindness To tell of their qualities is the practice of bodhisattvas.   15. Although in a gathering of many people, Someone uses abusive words and exposes your hidden faults,  Seeing them as a spiritual friend and To bow with respect is the practice of bodhisattvas.   16. Although another, who is as cherished as your child, Takes you for an enemy, Like a mother whose child is gravely ill, To love them even more is the practice of bodhisattvas.   17. Although a person who is your equal or less Through pride seeks to defame you, To respect them as you respect a teacher and To place them on your crown is the practice of bodhisattvas.  
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 8  18. Although immersed in poverty and always scorned,  Plagued by grave illness and evil spirits too, Not losing heart but taking on the negativities And the suffering of all beings is the practice of bodhisattvas.   19. Although famous, with crowds bowing down, And being as affluent as the god of wealth, Seeing the riches of samsara as insubstantial and To have no arrogance is the practice of bodhisattvas.   20. Not having tamed the enemy anger In seeking to tame external enemies, they will simply multiply  Therefore, with an army of loving-kindness and compassion  To tame your mind-stream is the practice of bodhisattvas.   21. Desired objects are just like drinking salt water As much as you enjoy them, that much does your craving  increase.  To give up immediately all things That give rise to attachment is the practice of bodhisattvas.   22. Things as they appear are your own mind; From beginningless time, the mind’s nature is free   of fabricated extremes. Knowing this, not being taken in by the appearances Of subject and object is the practice of bodhisattvas.  23. When meeting with a pleasing object, See it as a rainbow in summer having A beautiful appearance, but it is not real. To give up attachments is the practice of bodhisattvas.   24. Diverse sufferings are like a child’s death in a dream;  To take such delusions as real, how exhausting! Therefore, when encountering difficult situations, Seeing them as delusions is the practice of bodhisattvas.

 9 25. If those aspiring for enlightenment, even give their body  away,  What need to mention giving external objects away? Therefore, without hope of receiving return or positive results  To be generous is the practice of bodhisattvas.   26. If lacking discipline, you cannot even benefit yourself,  Then wishing to benefit others is ridiculous. Therefore, to maintain a discipline With no desire for samsara is the practice of bodhisattvas.   27. For bodhisattvas aspiring to a wealth of virtue,  Anything that harms is a treasury of precious jewels.  Therefore, never getting tired and angry and Being patient is the practice of bodhisattvas.   28. If shravakas and pratyekabuddhas, working for   their own benefit  Make efforts as if extinguishing a fire on their head, To develop even more diligence, the source of good qualities  That benefit all beings, is the practice of bodhisattvas.  29. Knowing that Vipashyana fully settled in Shamatha Completely conquers all disturbing emotions To stay in a meditative concentration that perfectly transcends The four formless ones is the practice of bodhisattvas.   30. Since perfect enlightenment cannot be attained Through the five perfections if they lack prajna,  To cultivate this wisdom endowed with skillful means and  The three non-conceptual aspects is the practice of  bodhisattvas.   31. By not examining your own confusion, It’s possible to act in a non-Dharmic way while maintaining a  practitioner’s guise. Therefore, always examining your confusion and To discard it is the practice of bodhisattvas.  
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 10 32. If bodhisattvas, through the power of kleshas, speak of   others’ faults, They themselves will be diminished. Therefore, not to mention the faults of those Who have entered the Mahayana path is the practice of  bodhisattvas.   33. Wanting gain and honor causes arguments to arise;  Causing activities of listening, reflecting, and meditating  to decline.  Therefore, to give up attachment to one’s households  Friends, relatives, and donors is the practice of bodhisattvas.   34. Harsh words trouble the minds of others And diminish a bodhisattva’s conduct. Therefore, to give up harsh words that are Not pleasing to others, is the practice of bodhisattvas.   35. Once habituated to kleshas, it’s difficult to counter  them with remedies. The Noble Being with mindfulness and alertness takes up  the  weapon of an antidote To slay the kleshas of desire and all other kleshas As soon as they arise is the practice of bodhisattvas.   36. In brief, wherever you are and whatever you do,  While staying continually mindful and alert  To the state of your mind, To benefit others is the practice of bodhisattvas.   37. So that the suffering of sentient beings beyond number   may be cleared away, With a superior knowledge permeated by three-fold purity To dedicate all virtue toward enlightenment Gained by their effort is the practice of bodhisattvas.     
The Root Text 
 11 (c) Following the meaning of the sutras, tantras, and  treatises And the teachings of genuine masters. I have given these thirty-seven verses of a bodhisattva’s  practice  For the benefit of those who wish to train on   the bodhisattva’s path.   (d) Since my intelligence is low and I am poorly trained, The art of this text will not delight scholars. Yet since they are based on the sutras and teachings of  genuine masters, I believe these practices of a bodhisattva to be free of  confusion.   (e) Since an inferior intellect such as mine has difficulty  fathoming The great waves of a bodhisattva’s activity,  I pray that genuine masters will be patient With all the defects here―contradictions, irrelevancies,   and so on.   (f) Through the virtue arising from these verses, May all beings become like the protector Chenrezig, Who, out of supreme relative and absolute bodhichitta, Remains in neither the extreme of samsaric existence nor   nirvanic peace.   For the benefit of self and other, the monk Ngülchu Thogme, who elucidates the scriptures and their logic, composed these verses at the Precious Cave of Mercury.

 13   Chapter 1  An Introduction to the Text  he present text, The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva was written by the bodhisattva Ngülchu Thogme. This text is concerned with conduct, rather than with the view of Buddhism. This is because to achieve enlightenment regardless of the profundity of our view and meditation, our conduct needs to be stainless. We need to be precise in the way we work with the interdependence of phenomena2 and how we deal with cause and result (karma). Our conduct needs to be precise in the sense that we have to conduct ourselves so that we are in harmony with all other beings. So regardless of our view in meditation, we definitely need to receive precise instruction on correct conduct. This instruction on our conduct can be found in this The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva.  I. THE INTRODUCTION A. THE HOMAGE Namo Lokeshvaraya  The text begins with a one-line homage in Sanskrit which is Namo Lokeshvaraya or “Homage to the Bodhisattva Loke-shvara.” Lokeshvara is another name for Avalokiteshvara  2. The principal that nothing exists independently, but comes into existence only in dependence on various previous causes and conditions. There are twelve successive phases of this process that begin with ignorance and end with old age and death. See Appendix F for details on page 114.  T 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 14 (Tib. Chenrezig).  While the rest of the text is in Tibetan, the reason the homage is in Sanskrit is that when the scholars of Tibet composed original texts, or when they translated Sanskrit texts, it was very important that the style and the meaning of text be completely in accordance with the Buddha’s words and the commentaries of the Buddhist scholars of India. To demonstrate their respect for the Buddha’s original teachings and the teachings of the great scholars and practitioners (Skt. panditas and siddhas) of India and to demonstrate the fact that they had not just made up a completely new commentary, the Tibetan texts usually had some lines in Sanskrit at the beginning of the text. So even texts that are almost entirely in Tibetan (as is this text), often have the first line of the homage in Sanskrit.   The homage here is to the Bodhisattva Chenrezig. We might think that the homage should be to the Buddha himself. But when we pay homage to the Buddha, we are not so much paying homage to the Buddha’s body, but to his mind. Generally speaking, there are three main qualities that are possessed fully only by a buddha: consummate wisdom, total kindness, and complete power. These are represented in Tibetan Buddhism by the three bodhisattvas with the wisdom of all the buddhas embodied in Manjushri, the loving-kindness and compassion of all the buddhas embodied in Chenrezig, and the consummate effectiveness or power of all buddhas embodied in the Lord of Secrets, Vajrapani. The loving-kindness of a buddha is the root for helping others and therefore the text pays homage to Chenrezig.  The bodhisattva Chenrezig has many, many names, such as “Lotus in the Hand” and the “All-seeing One.” Here Chenrezig is referred to as Lokeshvara, or “Lord of the World” with the Sanskrit word ishvara meaning “lord” and loka in Sanskrit meaning “world.” The reason Chenrezig is referred to as Lokeshvara in this homage is that the aspect of Chenrezig that is being emphasized in this text is his ability 
Introduction to the Text 
 15 to lead all beings onto the path. In that sense Chenrezig is the embodiment of all the loving-kindness and the impartial compassion of all the buddhas. It is to him that we pay homage.  B. THE EXPRESSION OF VENERATION  a. To the Ones who see that all phenomena neither   come nor go  And who only seek to benefit sentient beings To the supreme lama and the protector Chenrezig, With respect I bow continually through the three gates.  It was the custom in the great Buddhist monasteries and monastic universities of India such as Nalanda to have a Buddhist treatise begin with two things: an expression of veneration and a promise to compose the text. This custom of beginning any composition with these two items was continued by all the Buddhist scholars and siddhas of Tibet. In this text the expression of veneration is given in this first verse.  The expression of veneration in this verse can be directed towards any buddha or bodhisattva. The main idea of this verse of veneration is for the writer to abandon his or her arrogance by recognizing the need to follow the example of the individual to whom the veneration is directed and also to make a supplication asking for the elimination of obstacles that might otherwise prevent the accurate writing of the composition. The second function of this verse is to show readers that they also must abandon arrogance and follow the example of those being venerated and that they need to revere these examples in order to understand the meaning of the text.   In this text the verse of homage is primarily directed to the Bodhisattva Chenrezig. Sometimes we pay homage physically by doing prostrations. Sometimes we offer 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 16 homage verbally by saying, “I pay homage.” We also sometimes offer a purely mental homage. Each of these three is not fully effective alone because the full power of homage is produced with all three of these working together. Of course, a purely mental homage is better than a purely physical or verbal homage, yet it doesn’t have the same effectiveness as one that unifies the body, speech, and mind. In the last line of this verse it says, “With respect I bow continually through the three gates” using the word “continually” to mean, “I don’t just pay homage to you at this moment. I will always pay homage to you with my mind, my speech, and my body” with the three gates being the body, speech, and mind.  The third line of this verse says, “To the supreme lama and the protector Chenrezig,” In this case, “supreme lama” refers primarily to one’s root guru, but it is also an invocation to the lineage gurus. This line demonstrates how it is necessary to have confidence, longing, and trust for the lama or guru. Gampopa in The Jewel Ornament of Liberation also stresses the point that the root guru or spiritual friend is extremely important. Gampopa gives three metaphors showing the importance of the root guru.   The first metaphor for the importance of the root guru is traveling on an unfamiliar road in an unfamiliar place. In this situation we need someone to show us how to travel this road in order to get to where we are going. If we are accompanied by someone who has traveled this road before and who can show us how to get there, it will be an easy journey. If we do not have such a guide, it will be very difficult because we won’t know where to go and what difficulties we may encounter on the way. Similarly, we have been wandering through samsara from the beginning of time and we do not know what actions lead to Buddhahood and which actions lead to freedom from samsara. As a result, we need a root guru or spiritual friend to show us the path. 
Introduction to the Text 
 17  The second metaphor is of traveling in a dangerous place. If we are going to travel to a dangerous place, we are going to need a powerful escort who can protect us from the beasts of prey and bandits that lie in wait for us. Similarly, we are traveling in samsara with its lower realms (such as the hungry ghosts, animal, and hell realms) where harmful actions and the disturbing emotions (Skt. kleshas)3 can be very dangerous and send us to unfavorable situations. However, we do not need to fear these dangers if we travel with the spiritual friend who will show us how to avoid these dangerous actions and protect us.  The third metaphor given by Gampopa is that if we wish to cross a large river with a very powerful current and we do not know how to handle the boat in this very dangerous river, it is unlikely that we will be able to cross on our own. The boat might tip over and we will drown or the boat might end up taking us somewhere entirely different. Therefore, we need a guru who has the experience of crossing the river of samsara and who has the kindness to actually take us across it. For these three reasons, we should venerate the root guru.  What are the qualities of the supreme guru and Chenrezig that we are venerating? Our root guru is in-separable from Chenrezig and has achieved consummate benefit for himself, which means, as the first line of this verse says, “To the Ones who see that all phenomena neither come nor go.”   It is through the guru’s realization of the true nature of phenomena, that he or she is totally without fear of the cause of suffering, the disturbing emotions, and so forth. Being totally without fear, the guru has the second quality of the  3. Throughout the text the Tibetan word nyon mong (Skt. klesha) which often has been translated as “afflictions,” refers to the five mental “poisons” which are attachment, aggression or anger, bewilderment or ignorance, jealousy, and pride. These conditions are emotions that disturb the natural mind so we translate them as “disturbing emotions.” 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 18 supreme accomplishment for the benefit for others. Being totally without fear, the guru has the courage and ability to help and protect others; the guru will also never abandon others, and this is expressed in the second line, “And who only seek to benefit sentient beings.” Giving us these two benefits of gurus of benefiting us and helping others are the two qualities expressed in this verse.  C. THE REASON FOR COMPOSING THIS TEXT  b. Perfect Buddhas, source of all benefit and happiness, Arise through accomplishing the genuine Dharma,  This further depends on knowing the practice, And so, the practices of bodhisattvas will be explained.   The second verse in the text is the promise by the author to compose the text and a statement of his or her intention. Generally, the form of this section of this text will be the statement, “I will compose such and such for such and such reasons,” so it involves an explanation of the reason for the composition and then what that composition will consist of. Such a promise of intention is very important, just as important as when we decide to undertake the practice of Dharma. Of course, it is necessary that once we have begun something, we should actually go through the process of doing it, otherwise it is of no use. The first line of this verse refers to the goal of the text which is to reach the state of Buddhahood––the source of all benefit and happiness. The term “all benefit” here refers to the fact that we are living in samsara and we have a great deal of mental suffering, unhappiness, worry, agitation, and so forth. By relying on the speech of the Buddha—the Dharma teachings—we can transform our situation of mental misery into a state of tranquility in which our mind is naturally clear and happy. The term “happiness” here refers to the alleviation of physical suffering. Normally, in our life we experience a 
Introduction to the Text 
 19 great deal of physical suffering. Looking at the body, speech, and mind, we see speech is merely sound. What we have to take care in life is mainly our bodies and our minds. If our minds are in a state of great agitation, our bodies will have a great deal of suffering and sickness as well. So ultimately speaking, the source of the alleviation of physical suffering relies on the perfect buddhas.  The second line, “Arise through accomplishing the genuine Dharma” makes the point that all buddhas without exception have all become buddhas based on their correct practice of the genuine Dharma. If we wish to attain Buddhahood, we need to rely upon the Dharma. If we practice Dharma, we need to know how to do so correctly. If we practice incorrectly, it might do the opposite leading us into the lower realms. Whether we are engaged in the cultivation of meditation, the recitation of mantra, doing prostrations or any other physical acts for the accumulation of merit and wisdom, or we are doing acts of generosity—every one of these acts has to be done based on a correct and precise understanding of why we are doing them. So, the reason for this composition is that this text will explain how actual practice is to be done by someone on the path of a bodhisattva.  Questions  Question: How does interdependence or interdependent origination correlate with duality? Rinpoche: Interdependence (See Appendix F for the twelve links of interdependence on page 114) is the fact that most of the qualities we perceive are, in fact, labels we place on our experiences that are valid only when in comparison to something else. We experience things as being good and bad, big and small, helpful or harmful all the time, but none of these things have any real inherent qualities. There is no reality to these qualities such as big and small because they change depending on what they are compared with. For 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 20 example, if we have a two-inch stick of incense and compare it to a four-inch stick of incense, everyone would say the four-inch stick is the longer one. Then if we take away the two-inch stick and replace it with a six-inch stick, then everyone will say the four-inch stick is now the shorter one. Yet we live and act as though these qualities and judgements we have about these things have inherent validity from the point of view of the objects themselves. The fact that phenomena does not have inherent qualities is called the emptiness or insubstantiality of comparative labels. This is one kind of interdependence which is called “the inter-dependence of relative designation.”   Another aspect of interdependence is “interdependent origination” which is the fact that things appear to arise from certain causes coming together. Basically, the relationship between interdependence and the apprehension of duality is that things are interdependent—that’s how things are. If we believe something that is interdependent to not be inter-dependent, there will be a false perception of duality of the separation of “I” and “other.” When we do not recognize the process of interdependence, the consequence is that we develop the false belief that we are a permanent self. Having an incorrect belief that we are an independent self creates a belief in a solid other. This false dualistic belief of there being “I” and “other” as being separate entities creates ignorance or confusion, which in turn produces suffering and all the problems of samsara. So, the recognition of inter-dependence is the opposite of the state of fixation on duality.  
 
 21   Chapter 2  The Preliminaries  e will now discuss the main body of the text. These thirty-seven verses can be divided into three main sections: the preliminaries, the main body, and the conclusion. . II. THE PRELIMINARIES  1.  Having now attained this difficult to find great vessel    of leisure and resources,  In order to free yourself and others day and night   without a break  From the ocean of samsara and  To listen, reflect, and meditate, is the practice of    bodhisattvas.   The first main section of the preliminaries occupies the first seven verses. The first verse is concerned with the necessity of having diligence in the context of our present situation of possessing the opportunities and resources which make up a precious human existence. The term “attained the great vessel of leisure and resources” refers to all sentient being born as human beings, not those being born as an animal nor in a lower realm.4  Simply having a human body is an excellent and necessary condition for practicing the Dharma. The  4.  See Appendix B on page 68 for a list of these eight freedoms and ten endowments. W 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 22 metaphor presented here is that we are presently in the vessel of the human body and we need to cross the river of samsara. Only with a human body can we practice Dharma and only by practicing Dharma in this vessel can we cross the river of samsara. Without a human body and practicing the Dharma, there is simply no way we can attain enlightenment.  This human body is not only a necessary condition for the practice of Dharma, but it is extremely rare and extremely hard to acquire. So, at this moment what we possess is something that is necessary, rare, and excellent in every way. Therefore, we need to be very careful to not waste it because this human body does not last.  There are two benefits that we can achieve through the correct application of this precious human body. First, we can help ourselves to achieve the complete and utter eradication of all physical and mental suffering of our physical existence, our physical environment, and our mental situation. To accomplish this, we need to use our physical body with great diligence in the practice of Dharma. In the same way, we can also use our precious human body to carry others across the ocean of the suffering of samsara.  If we don’t make use of this precious human birth now, we are going to lose it; and when we lose it, it will be something that is not easily found again. We should practice Dharma right now without distraction “throughout day and night without a break.” To be without distraction during the day means not allowing ourselves to be distracted by meaningless activities. Without distraction at night means not succumbing to laziness and the tendency to sleep away our life. It is therefore necessary to engage with the utmost diligence throughout day and night for the benefit of achieving our own benefit and that of others.   Our initial problem in this process is that we do not know how to free ourselves from samsara. We need to rely upon three sources of information. To do this we should, “listen, reflect, and meditate.” To do these, we must first acquire the 
The Preliminaries  
 23 necessary information by “listening.”5 While this is absolutely necessary, it is not enough. Simply acquiring this information will not allow us to achieve liberation. It is necessary to engage in the second step which is reflection or contemplation. Contemplation consists of appraising the teachings that we have received and thinking, “What do these teachings really mean? What is really being said here? What is the point of this particular statement and remark, and what do other bodhisattvas, other scholars and siddhas have to say about this that might help me understand it?” This kind of contemplation is absolutely necessary, but it too is not sufficient. Once the teachings have been received and reflected upon, we must actually put them into practice by actually applying them to our life in the practice of meditation. However, it is necessary to know that meditation by itself is not enough, in the sense that meditation cannot occur in the absence of studying and contemplation. Therefore, these three aspects of Dharma practice—listening, reflection, and meditation—must be cultivated in that order.   2. Toward friends, attachment churns like water,  Toward enemies, hatred burns like fire.  When dark with ignorance, one forgets what to    adopt or reject.  To give up this homeland is the practice of bodhisattvas.  The second verse deals with the next topic of this text which is described in the fourth line of this verse, “to give up this homeland is the practice of bodhisattvas.” The Tibetan term payül is used for “homeland.” In ordinary conversation this word would refer to where you were born or grew up. But in  5. Thrangu Rinpoche has said the “listening” is a literal word and refers to earlier days when most Dharma instruction was received by listening to the guru. Nowadays, “studying” is probably a more appropriate word. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 24 this verse, it does not refer to that. For example, it is said that Milarepa needed to practice in his homeland in order to attain higher powers of siddhi. The reason the word “homeland” is used here is that most people usually have a great deal of attachment and aversion when they remain in the area where they were born. But the actual intention of the verse is to refer to any place which causes the three disturbing emotions (attachment, aggression, and ignorance) called “the three poisons” to flourish. What is meant here is not that we must abandon where we were born but that we must abandon any place that puts us in the situation of having intense attachment, aggression, and ignorance. So, this verse is saying we should abandon a place or situation which leads to the disturbing emotions and this is the appropriate conduct of a bodhisattva. Also, when we say the “three poisons,” there are two ways we can use the term. We can use “the three poisons” to imply seeds or karmic latencies or we can use “the three poisons” for things that manifests in situations. Here we are referring the three major disturbing emotions that manifest in situations. The first situation involving the disturbing emotion of attachment or passion is described as, “Toward friends, attachment churns like water.” When we are in a situation of a familiar place where we have many friends, our attachments become very intense and this is like an agitated body of water with one wave crashing after another with no peace in between.   The next line discusses the disturbing emotion of hatred or aggression with “Toward enemies, hatred burns like fire.” The concept of “friends” and “enemies” or “people we like or don’t like” are simply mentally created labels that we attach with strong fixation onto people we know. And yet, while they are simply imaginary labels, we still identify very strongly with them. We think, “This is my friend and that is a person who wants to harm me.” By putting a great deal of energy into the negativity towards the person who is our 
The Preliminaries  
 25 “enemy” we project and we develop great hatred and this anger burns us up like a fire.   The third main disturbing emotion is ignorance described in the line, “When dark with ignorance, one forgets what to adopt or reject.” This mainly refers to what is called “manifest ignorance,” not “basic ignorance.”6 Manifest ignorance occurs when basic ignorance actually manifests as forgetfulness. This refers to the fact that we all know what is acceptable and what is not acceptable conduct, yet we become so intoxicated by the disturbing emotions of attachment and aggression that we forget what we should do and what we should not do. We mix what is acceptable and what is not up, make stupid mistakes, and engage in all forms of ridiculous confusion. In other words, we totally lose track of what is good that we should accept and what is bad that we should reject. The root of this kind of stupidity or manifest ignorance is attachment and aggression that is fertilized by that ignorance causing us to totally lose track of good and bad.  3. By abandoning negative places, disturbing emotions    gradually decrease.   With no distractions, virtuous activity naturally grows.   Through a clear mind, certainty in the Dharma arises.   To rely on solitude is the practice of bodhisattvas.  Strictly speaking in the last line “To rely on solitude” refers to going to a place with few people are coming and going in the daytime and at nighttime there also is little or no noise. In fact, this is just an external way of looking at solitude and what is really important is the solitude of the mind. A very  6. “Basic ignorance” refers to ignorance in relation to the three disturbing emotions (kleshas) in attachment, aggression, and ignorance. It specifically refers to not knowing that external phenomena are empty of inherent existence. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 26 quiet place is ideal because noise does cause a tendency to become distracted but it is impossible to find a place of absolute quietness. Even if we are somewhere where there are few people, there will still be the sound of animals and birds. Even if we manage to block out these sounds, we will be distracted by the sound of our own blood rushing through the arteries of our ears. However, that aside, solitude is necessary for practice. This verse gives three reasons why solitude is an appropriate lifestyle for a bodhisattva. The first reason is “disturbing emotions gradually decrease.” “Negative places” refers to environments in which our attachments or aggressions naturally come up. While it is difficult to totally cut off all disturbing emotions in an instant; if we remain in an environment which is without conditions or circumstances that stimulate the disturbing emotions it is possible for our disturbing emotions to gradually cool down. It is therefore appropriate to embrace an environment that allows this reduction of disturbing emotions to take place.   The second reason for seeking solitude is that there are different kinds of distraction. We can be distracted by pleasures of the senses, by an interesting conversation, or even by our own thoughts. Whatever form it takes, if it distracts us either internally or externally, then our virtuous activity and our practice will not go well. However, if we relinquish external and internal distractions, our virtuous activity and meditation will naturally increase and then flourish.   The third reason for having solitude is that, “Through a clear mind, certainty in the Dharma arises.” Remaining in solitude induces a state of mental tranquility which allows our awareness to become clear. The clearer our awareness becomes, the more we will understand and develop trust in the Dharma.  In summary, we have discussed the first three of the thirty-seven verses. These verses described the importance 
The Preliminaries  
 27 of listening, contemplation, and meditation. They also discussed the appropriateness of abandoning our homeland; and finally, the importance of living in solitude.   4.  Close old friends and relatives separate.  Material wealth gained with effort is relinquished.  The guest, the consciousness leaves its lodging,    the body, behind.   To let go of this life is the practice of bodhisattvas.   This notion of abandoning our life sounds strange—perhaps even frightening to beginners and it also sounds like it is something that is practically impossible to do. However, what is meant by in these verses is that we normally invest a great deal of hope into the outcome of our daily life and have a great deal of attachment to the mundane circumstances of life. But neither of these attitudes of placing our energies in these circumstances does us much overall good.   There are two aspects to reality––ultimate reality (Tib. dondam) and conventional reality (Tib. kunzob).7 These thirty-seven practices are primarily concerned with conventional truth or reality, but within conventional reality there are two aspects: The nature of conventional reality and the appearance of conventional reality. This verse deals with the disparity between these two. The fact is that the nature of relative phenomena is actually not the way we usually understand it to be. Phenomena of this world appears to us to be very important and yet, in its actual nature, they are not  7. In Buddhism there are two levels to the reality phenomena. The first is conventional reality or relative truth which is all the things we see and experience which seem solid and real, but have been shown by the Middle-way school to be insubstantial or inherently “empty.” These included trees and buildings and our self as a “real” person, our thoughts, and so on. The second reality is called ultimate reality or absolute truth which is how phenomena really are and is experienced only by the truly enlightened individual. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 28 very important or beneficial to us. So, if we have very little attachment to the things in ordinary life, we will ironically have a good life and get a lot done.  What is the first reason to abandon the concerns of this life? The first line mentions, “Separate from close old friends and relatives.” Normally, we act as though we will be with our family and friends forever and therefore we develop a great deal of affection and love for them and hold the assumption that we are never going to lose them. But regardless of how long we can be together with our friends or family in this life, at some point we are going to be separated from them. We may have made a great investment of all our energy into the cultivation of having friends and family. The extent of this energy we put in for worldly relationships is the extent that we will suffer when we lose them. So, it is appropriate to be less emotionally dependent upon our friends and family.   The second reason we should not be too attached to our mundane life is to “relinquish material wealth gained with effort.” In a similar way, we tend to think and act as though everything we buy and accumulate—our wealth and possessions—will be with us forever. We accumulate these things by going through a great deal of trouble and effort and this causes us to become more and more involved with enjoying the convenience and beauty of these possessions that we have accumulated. Yet at death every one of these things will be left behind, just as all our relatives and friends will also be left behind. In summary, we should not be too attached to either persons nor material things.   Furthermore, “The guest, consciousness, leaves its lodging, the body, behind.” Of all things in this entire world, we are most attached to is our body. Of course, it is necessary to engage in a certain amount of activity to protect and sustain our body. But to be totally concerned with the preservation and health of our body is inappropriate because at death we are going to leave it. Rather, we should regard 
The Preliminaries  
 29 our body as a guest house in which at the moment we are staying, but knowing that we will eventually have to move on. If we think about it, the duration of time our consciousness rests in this guest house of a body is quite short—just a few years—and one day we are going to definitely leave it. The point is that if we can lessen our attachment to friends and family, our material possessions and accomplishments, and also our body then we will have more room for our practice of Dharma. So, the text tells us to let go of this attachment to life.  The next two verses (verse five and six) are concerned with two aspects of the same situation. We know that our mind is very easily influenced and very easily changed by the situations around us. Sometimes we may seem to be set on a certain course, saying, “I am going to do this and not do that. This is the appropriate thing to do but before we know it, we have changed our course of action. Sometimes these changes are brought about because of our companions or friends. Because our mind is so susceptible and unstable and easily influenced by those around us, it is necessary that we exercise some caution in choosing who we are around and learn to stay away from bad friends and to cultivate good friends. How to stay away from bad friends and how to cultivate good friends are the subjects of the next verses.  5.  If we make friends with these, then the three poisons   grow and  The activities of listening, reflecting, and meditating    degenerate,  Loving-kindness and compassion are destroyed.  To cast off bad friends is the practice of bodhisattvas.   How do we really know who is good and who is bad for us? In some situations, it is quite easy to tell, but in most situations, we don’t readily know and therefore often mistake one for the other. For this reason, we should rely on 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 30 the explanation of these topics that are found in the Buddha’s word in the sutras and also in the Buddhist commentaries (the shastras) by the great scholars and siddhas and in the oral instructions of the root and lineage gurus. What exactly is a bad companion or a companion who is a bad influence? The first line of this verse says, “If we make friends with these, the three poisons will grow.” “Make friends with these” means to become too attached to close friends and relatives, or to wealth, or to our body. The term “poison” is obviously a metaphor. Poison harms whoever drinks it, whether it is us or someone else. In the context of the Buddhist Dharma, the three major disturbing emotions of attachment, aggression, and bewilderment are called “poisons” because they are always harmful to us. There is no possible situation in which these disturbing emotions are not harmful.  We will sometimes notice that being with certain companions will cause our attachment to someone or some-thing to increase or that some distracting activity will radically increase, or that our aggression increases because we forget what is appropriate and what is inappropriate. All these activities cause us to lose sight of what we should do and not do. If we continue to ally ourselves with people who are a negative influence, then we will bring about harm to ourselves, harm to them, and very likely harm for other people as well. So, the first line deals with how a bad companion increases our negative behavior.  The second line deals with how an inappropriate companion decreases our positive qualities with the activities of listening, reflecting, and meditating degenerate.” We as Dharma practitioners need to engage in the three knowledges (Skt. prajna)—hearing the Dharma properly, contemplate it until we have resolved its true meaning, and then to actually bring it into our mind through meditation so that the Dharma actually changes our mind. If we find that allying ourselves with someone who interferes with our hearing, 
The Preliminaries  
 31 contemplation, and meditation and that our interest and enthusiasm for these activities decline, then that person is a bad influence.   The third line deals with how this relationship will affect others too when, “loving-kindness and compassion are destroyed.” We have already determined that an appropriate companion would be one who caused our disturbing emotions to decrease and cause our hearing, contemplation, and meditation to increase. It is also true that an appropriate companion will often cause our development of loving-kindness and compassion to flourish. If we find that we are under the influence of someone who causes us to have less and less loving-kindness and compassion for others, then this is a definite way to recognize that this a person or company is a really bad influence upon us. For the time being it would be a very good thing to stay away from such a person.  6.  Rely on this one and defects disappear;  Positive qualities increase like the waxing moon.  So, to care for the spiritual friend  More than your own body is the practice of bodhisattvas.   If we recognize that someone has a good and appropriate influence on us, then we should treasure that person more than we treasure anything else in our life. Generally speaking, the most precious thing to us is our own body and therefore that is used as the example here. We should treasure a spiritual friend, someone who has a good effect on us, with more intensity than we cherish our own life. In fact, such a person is a very necessary influence on our life.   Verse 6 begins with “rely on this one” which means to rely upon someone who is a good influence. In verse 5 we saw that someone who is a negative influence causes our three disturbing emotions to flourish. Being described in this 6th verse is someone who has the opposite effect—someone 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 32 whose company seems to reduce our mind poisons and mental disturbances. We may find that because of this person we become a little less aggressive, a little less attached, and a little less ignorant; it is important to re-cognize that this slight improvement is very significant.   Positive qualities referred to in the second line are all the qualities of hearing, reflection, and meditation discussed in the previous verse along with the qualities of loving-kindness and compassion. “Like the waxing moon” means that if someone’s influence causes you to increase your studying, contemplation, meditation, loving-kindness, and compassion, even if the increase is very slight, it is a sign that this person is a genuinely good influence for you. Now this influence might be very, very slight, but it will be continual. You might start out with almost no loving-kindness and compassion and over time you might develop a little bit, and from a little bit develop much more. In any case, to accompany a person who has this positive influence on you, you should to talk to them, relate to them and practice Dharma in their company with great diligence. This is very important.  7.  They bind themselves within the prison of samsara,   Whom could the worldly gods protect?  Therefore, in seeking protection, going for refuge  In the Three Jewels is the practice of bodhisattvas.   The seventh verse concerns the preliminaries and discusses going for refuge in those rare and supreme ones referring to the Three Jewels, namely the Buddha, the Dharma, and the sangha. The fact is that in our life and even within our mind there are a lot of defects, a lot of obstacles, a lot of confusion, and a great deal of suffering. The notion of going for refuge is that we need some reliable method which will lead to the elimination of all these defects, dangers, and suffering. The first jewel is the Buddha. There are many different buddhas, 
The Preliminaries  
 33 such as the 1,000 Buddhas of this fortunate eon, but practically speaking we mean the historical Buddha Shakyamuni who was born in India, attained full awakening at Bodhgaya, and taught the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma. Importantly, it was the Buddha Shakyamuni who first taught the teachings which we call “Dharma.”  Now a buddha, of course, performs many different types of actions and all the actions are mainly concerned with the protection of other beings. But the Buddha has said, “I do not remove suffering with my hands nor do I cleanse it with water. I pacify the suffering of beings by presenting the Dharma, which pacifies and tames.” The point of this is that the Buddha’s capacity to protect beings lies principally in his role as a teacher, the person who gave us the Dharma. So going for refuge in the Buddha means accepting the Buddha as our teacher, as the person who gave us the Dharma. This means that we need to also go for refuge in the Dharma which “pacifies and tames.” This Dharma consists of the three excellent trainings: the training in personal discipline presented in the Vinaya, the training in meditation presented in the sutras, and the training in developing intelligence presented in the Abhidharma. Going for refuge in the Dharma means accepting Dharma as our path. To travel on this path, we need the assistance of our spiritual community or sangha, the third jewel. The sangha consists of individuals who have experience of hearing, reflection, and meditation and the wisdom they gained through their experience, they can assist us in our practice by pointing out when we have gone off the track and pointing out when we need to change our emphasis in practice and so forth. The validity of going for refuge in the Three Jewels lies in the fact that the Buddha, Dharma, and sangha are without deception because they are truly liberated from samsara. This means that there is no danger that these three levels will not be genuine sources of protection.  
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 34  This is not true of other sources of refuge that one might select, and this is what is mentioned in the first two lines of this verse 7: “They bind themselves within the prison of samsara, whom could the worldly gods protect?” These two lines are primarily directed to those born in Tibet. While everyone in Tibet would take refuge in the Three Jewels, some Tibetans would also take refuge or worship in local gods associated with high mountains or particular rivers and so forth. These local gods are spirits who are still part of samsara. People did this for some short-term benefit such as helping them by gaining wealth or having good relation-ships. But because these worldly gods and protectors are not liberated themselves, they cannot really protect you.8  Questions  Question: What if you have a conflict such that your parents want you to spend all your time with them and not with the Dharma, and that they are a kind of negative influence in their conversations which are usually against other political views, religions or races? You want to be kind to your parents, but is spending time with them beneficial? Rinpoche: Generally speaking, it is appropriate to try to repay your parents’ kindness, their first kindness being that they created your body and they sustained you throughout your childhood. While that is the case, it is also true that parents often give mistaken advice. And if you listen to this mistaken advice, it will not be of any benefit to you and it will also not do them any good either. What is appropriate in this case is not to argue and just not follow his advice.   8. A large number of the locapalas are still honored and followed in tibet because they have been beneficial in healing in shamanic practices and many have also been incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as Dharma protectors (Skt. dharmapalas). 
The Preliminaries  
 35 Question: There is also one version of taking refuge first in the guru or lama and then in the Buddha, Dharma and sangha. Why does one take refuge in the lama first? Rinpoche: Generally speaking, according to the Foundation vehicle there are only Three Jewels, three sources of refuge—the Buddha, Dharma, and sangha. In the Vajrayana, the first refuge is the guru. In fact, in the Vajrayana tradition it is said that your guru is better than the Buddha and therefore one should put the guru before the Buddha. This is not to say that your guru necessarily has qualities equaling or surpassing those of the Buddha. It is possible that he or she might have qualities equaling those of the Buddha, but it’s extremely unlikely. Even from the point of view of kindness, it’s not possible that your guru could be as kind to the world as the Buddha was because the Buddha caused the Dharma to spread throughout the world and your guru can’t do that. Yet on a realistic, practical level your guru is more kind to you than the Buddha because the Buddha passed away more than 2,500 years ago and you have not met the Buddha, have not heard the Buddha teach, have not had access to the Buddha directly. And yet you can achieve the same result that you would achieve by receiving direct instructions from the Buddha by simply meeting, seeing, hearing and receiving instruction from your root guru. Therefore, from that point of view because the guru is available to you, the guru is called greater than the Buddha.  According to the Vajrayana tradition if you trust the root guru, that is the same as trusting in the Buddha; if you have no confidence or lose confidence in your root guru, then you have also lose confidence in the Buddha because you have lost confidence in the transmission of the Dharma that you have received from the guru. To indicate how vital complete confidence in your root guru is, the guru is the first refuge in the Vajrayana. Question: In reference to verses 5 and 6, which person’s company should we avoid and how do we bring that into 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 36 harmony with the Four Immeasurables9 where we are supposed to generate the attitude of impartiality towards all? Rinpoche: There is no contradiction. The importance of equanimity or impartiality is that in the generation of loving-kindness and compassion for all sentient beings there can be a problem, when you start to first feel loving-kindness and compassion. This is a problem if you have not consciously cultivated equanimity towards all beings, then this loving-kindness and compassion can become partial. Being partial you will feel compassion for some beings and this partial compassion for other beings will cause you to feel dislike or be negative towards for others, such as those who are causing you to suffer. Therefore, it is essential that the cultivation of loving-kindness and compassion begin with the cultivation of an equanimity that has no partiality among sentient beings. This is done to free you from attachment and aversion towards other beings.   What is being discussed in verses 5 and 6 is how to protect yourself on a practical level from situations that will cause your virtue to decrease and your disturbing emotions, habitual thoughts and so forth to increase. On this level you may have to stay away from certain sentient beings for a short time. But saying that you have to separate yourself from certain beings and stay away from them is not saying that you should not have loving-kindness and compassion for them or that you should develop aggression towards them. It is saying that physically you should not be around them. Question: Vimalakirti was a famous bodhisattva who wholly immersed in daily life even to the point of being a politician. The 37 Practices of a Bodhisattva seems to be a  9. The Four Immeasurables are: May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness; May all be free from suffering and the causes of suffering; May all never be separate from the sacred happiness which is sorrowless; May all cut attachment to dear ones and aversion to others and live believing in the equality of all that lives. 
The Preliminaries  
 37 Foundation level text, not a Mahayana text in comparison to the Vimalakirti sutra which seems to emphasize being fully involved in being impartial to evil. Rinpoche:  There is no contradiction here. The statement that we must abandon inappropriate or evil companions is a statement to be applied to a beginner. The reason is because a beginner we will easily and automatically absorb the defects of those around us. If we are around people with certain defects, then these will cause us to engage in disturbing emotions and we will not be able to accomplish anything that will be of benefit to ourselves or others.   What is being discussed in The Vimalakirti Nedesha Sutra is the situation of a great bodhisattva, Vimalakirti, who had consummate intelligence and such a high attainment that he was impervious to the influence of everything around him. Because his disturbing emotions had already been totally subdued, no defects could arise in his being. But if we try to do things Vimalakirti did, they could cause obstacles to our cultivation of virtue and we will have accomplished no good whatsoever. So, the situation described in the sutra is the situation of someone who has actualized the highest view.   An example of this is if you try to feed a dinner suitable for an adult consisting of solid food to a newborn baby, it would make the baby sick. But if you try to feed milk and small amounts of porridge to an adult, it will probably starve the adult. The point is that beginners must recognize themselves as beginners and act appropriately and leave matters of the higher view to those who have actualized this higher view. Question: Rinpoche, I have a problem with seeing the three poisons as causing harm because sometimes I experience that the desire to do something is good. Rinpoche: The three main disturbing emotions or kleshas are döchak translated as “desire” or “attachment” kongtro translated as “aggression” or “anger.” Well, there is a 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 38 difference between desire and attachment, and the main disturbing emotions (Skt. kleshas) which have been translated as “attachment.” These are different words in Tibetan; döchak which has been translating as “negative attachment,” and literally means “an attachment to” or “getting stuck on desire,” and machakpa, just “attachment” which is just wanting something. Machakpa can be wanting something good or bad, so machakpa itself is not considered as one of the three poisons. The word machagpa includes the desire to help others, the desire to accomplish Dharma, to achieve a benefit for others. The distinguishing feature of döchak is attachment when the mind becomes controlled by desire; it is the getting stuck (chak) that is the negative aspect to attachment. This getting stuck, this type of attachment is always poisonous because it is a lack of freedom.  There is an analogous situation with aversion or aggression. When we talk about aversion as a poison or disturbing emotion, we are not talking about having an aggressive manner or appearance because sometimes acting forcefully can be useful and appropriate. It is with the attitude to benefit others, that it is not the poison of aversion or aggression. The poison of aversion is the actual wish to hurt others, actually wanting the harm of others.  The third of the three poisons, timuk or “mental dullness or stupidity,” refers to losing track of what should be done and what should not be done, especially when we really know, but we are not doing it because of the influence of other disturbing emotions. This is always bad; there is no good can come from this mental dullness. Question: Rinpoche, attachment to people can lead to conflict and it can also keep one from meditating, giving rise to conflict, so attachment becomes a problem. I am certain that half the people in this room were wondering whether to leave their husband or wife. How would this fit in with relationships because as you know relationships can get very messy. 
The Preliminaries  
 39 Rinpoche: There is no need for the people in this room to all leave their spouses. Traditionally, there are two types of practitioners called “those who wear white clothes” and “those who wear red clothes.” Those “who wear white clothes” refers to householders and “those who wear red clothes” refers to those who have taken ordination with the vow of celibacy. And obviously those who are ordained as celibates must not be married. However, householders do not need to abandon their spouses. The problem is when there are not any healthy attachments in such relationships. It is when attachment gets out of hand and becomes too intense or excessive. I think that the reason why divorce is so common now is not because of a lack of attachment but because of an excess of attachment—you get so obsessed with the other person that there is no space and therefore no happiness. I think that if people could relax a little, this would not be so much of a problem.

 41   Chapter 3  The Three Types of Beings  III. THE MAIN PRACTICE  e come to the third main section of the text which is called the main practice. This section is divided into three sections: the path for what is called the lesser individual, the path for the middling or average individual and the path for the greater individual.   A. THE PATH FOR THE LESSER INDIVIDUAL  8. The suffering in the lower realms resulting    from negative actions  Is so difficult to bear, so the Buddha taught   That even at the risk of your life,  Never commit negative actions is the practice    of bodhisattvas.   The path for the lesser individual is presented in the eighth verse. While it is called “the path for the lesser individual” it is not to be construed as a path for someone with some kind of defect. This path is a path possessing good qualities and is the path of the average individual. In fact, every person needs to practice all three of these paths—those suitable for the lesser, average, and greater individuals. The distin-guishing feature of the path for a lesser individual is that the goal of this path is not liberation from samsara, but is seeking short-term alleviation from suffering. The goal of the lesser individual is to avoid experiencing the suffering of samsara, W 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 42 particularly the suffering of the lower realms, and to be able to enjoy the relief and comparative happiness of the higher realms. This is why “the suffering in the lower realms is so difficult to bear.”  Of the three lower realms, the realm that we can most easily experience directly is the realm of animals. Animals are afflicted by a lack of mental clarity, of often being hungry, and enduring violence against them. We generally tend not to think about this, but if we do think about it the life of a wild animal or a raised for food is very hard. That is why the next lines says, that what is really difficult to bear is the suffering in lower realms.   The focus in this level of the path is the realization that what we do in this life will cause our experience in our next and future lives. What we do is based on the attitudes that we hold in our mind, the words that we speak, and what we actually do with our body. If we have a negative or aggressive mind-set or engage in a great deal of harmful speech, and physically do things that are harmful to others, then these will result in the ten unvirtuous actions (See Appendix A on page 40). The Buddha taught that if we do these negative actions, we will be reborn in a very un-fortunate situation, such as that of an animal or the hell realms. We should accept this teaching of the Buddha to be literally true.   Now, the view of a lesser individual is the practical recognition of the fact that if we want to be happy and want to avoid suffering, we should never commit an evil action even at the cost of our life. Remember the lesser individual is defined as someone whose motivation to practice is one who has the desire to free themselves of the experience of the lower realms and to do this practice mainly consists of the cultivation of virtue and abandoning negative actions.    
The Three Types of Beings  
 43  B. THE PATH FOR THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL  9. Happiness of the three realms is like dew on the tip    of a blade of grass:  Its very nature makes it evaporate in an instant.  To strive for the supreme level of liberation  That never changes is the practice of bodhisattvas.   The average or middle level individuals are identified by the characteristic that they do not wish to just free themselves from the suffering of the lower realms, but wish to free themselves totally from all forms of samsara. This greater middling attitude inspires greater diligence. This motivation and practice is superior to the motivation and practice of the lesser individual. Nevertheless, average individuals still do not have the best possible motivation because the scope of their motivation only encompasses their own liberation. The aspiration of these middle level individuals is not the profound and vast aspiration which is the aspiration of the higher individuals which is the desire for the supreme happiness for all beings.  The path for the average individual is discussed in verse 9 and the basic point of this verse is that all of us want to free ourselves from samsara. The reason why it is appropriate to have this motivation is that everyone without exception really desires to be happy and there are no exceptions to this. The happiness that is possible in samsara in the three realms of samsara10 does sometimes occur. We cannot say that  10. The three realms are the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm. In the desire realm beings, like humans, are reborn with solid bodies due to their karma. In the form realm due to their meditation beings are reborn into a immaterial realm such as the pure lands. In the formless realms beings have entered a state of meditation after death so that their thoughts and perceptions have ceased.  
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 44 humans are never happy, that gods are never happy; that even animals have moments of happiness. While this happiness does occur, its fundamental characteristic is that is not stable. This happiness, regardless of how short or long it persists, at some time always changes into unhappiness. When it does so, it changes in an instant. We may have been in a state of happiness for a long time and all of a sudden it is gone.   The metaphor for this impermanence is just as dew on a morning grass dries up in an instant and is gone when the sun comes out and warms the earth. In the same way, while there are moments of happiness in samsara, they don’t last and will disappear at some point. The message in this verse is to not to put your hope in trying to achieve happiness within samsara, but to put your efforts into achieving unchanging happiness that is “To strive for the supreme level of liberation.” The next verse begins the presentation of the path for the more highly developed individual.  C. THE PATH FOR THE SUPERIOR INDIVIDUAL  10. From beginningless time my mothers have cared for me;  If they suffer, what good is my own happiness?  Thus, the goal of liberating beings without number and  To engender bodhichitta is the practice of bodhisattvas.   A highly developed spiritual individual is referred to as “superior” in this verse because he or she possesses superior intelligence, courage, and diligence. Essentially, the superiority of this individual consists entirely of the motivation that, “I will not only save myself; I will save and protect all beings; I will help all beings achieve a state of happiness.” The statement “all beings” here means just that; it doesn’t mean 100, 1000 or 1 million beings—it means each and every being without exception.  
The Three Types of Beings  
 45  There are two aspects to the practice of a superior individual; first is the motivation and second is how that motivation is applied. Obviously, it is necessary for the superior individual to begin with developing this motivation to help all beings and this is what is discussed in the 10th verse namely to “engender bodhichitta”11 is the practice of bodhisattvas.”   Bodhichitta or the aspiration to achieve supreme awakening is essentially the practitioner’s reaction to the realization of the nature of existence in samsara. Sentient beings are infinite in number. There are also beings we can see and there are beings we cannot see and there are beings in the ocean, in the sky, on and under the earth and so forth. There are large beings, small beings, intelligent beings, dull beings—all kinds of beings. The one thing that each and every sentient being has in common with each and every other sentient being is the desire to be happy. Each and every one of us also has the desire to be happy; each and every one of us is constantly thinking in one way or another, “Why can’t I be happy?” And yet for the most part each and every one of us lacks the knowledge of how to achieve happiness. In fact, we don’t even understand what true happiness is and this puts our desire and our actions at cross-purposes. Because of this, even if we succeed in achieving a temporary state of happiness, it turns into suffering. Even before our happiness turns into suffering, we live with so much fear that it is going to turn into suffering that we don’t really experience happiness at all. Now if we recognize this basic situation of life held by each and every being, then through this recognition we will begin to create the actual heart-felt desire to help each and every being be happy. That awakening of the wish for the happiness of others is the  11. Bodhichitta which comes from Sanskrit bodhi (awakened or enlightened) and chitta (mind) can be translated as the “awakened mind.” It is the desire to help every single being in this world to achieve complete and lasting happiness. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 46 beginning of what is called “bodhichitta” and this bodhi-chitta is the most important aspect of the training of a bodhisattva. If bodhichitta is present, that person is a bodhisattva; if bodhichitta is not present, that person is not.  The first two lines of this verse explain the fundamental reason why it is appropriate to generate such bodhichitta. It says: “From beginningless time my mothers have cared for me. If they suffer, what good is my own happiness?” It is a fact that in samsara, which has no beginning and no end, so that each and every being without exception has at one or many times been our mother. Not only our mother, but our child, our teacher so that each and every person in samsara has at one time or another protected us, loved us, saved our life, healed us from sickness, prevented us from becoming sick, fed and clothed us and so forth. If that is true, then we should want to repay their kindness. If we really believe that this is true, how could we possibly think that we should achieve only our own happiness and leave those other beings in the state of suffering? Even if we have achieved physical comfort for ourselves, how could we possibly be happy and content knowing that we have totally abandoned all of these other beings who had been in these positive relationships with us? This situation creates the motivation which produces the intense desire to benefit all beings.  So, this fact mentioned in Verse 10 is the beginning of developing bodhichitta which characterizes the Mahayana vehicle. However, merely developing this attitude is not enough; it must be put into practice which involves cultivating what is called “relative bodhichitta” and “ultimate bodhichitta.” And each of these two are cultivated in two ways: cultivating them during meditation and cultivating them in post-meditation.     
The Three Types of Beings  
 47 Questions  Question: Rinpoche, you mentioned that there were three types of practitioners (lower, average, and superior). I was wondering if we believe that we were just trying to free ourselves from the lower realms, that we actually should increase our aspiration for a higher level or whether we should just recognize that we are just working on this level? Rinpoche: First of all, there are practitioners who undertake only one of these paths. They simply practice the path of the lesser individual and only that and there are those who practice the lesser path and the path of the average individual, and then there are those who practice all three levels of the path. In our text, we are trying to enter the path and practices of a bodhisattva, which means that we need to practice all three levels. But it is important to know that it is not correct to regard the attitude of a lesser individual as bad, as something to be abandoned. For example, we may have the thought, “I am afraid of suffering. I want to avoid this suffering in the lower realms. While this is called the “lesser attitude,” it is not a belief that is bad and needs to be gotten rid of, rather it is a path that needs to be expanded on. In fact, this “lesser” attitude is good in the sense that it is a necessary attitude to have for developing the next attitude of the middling individual. From a point of view of the bodhisattva path, what is not appropriate is to be content only with the attitude of a lesser individual by thinking, “That is enough.”   The best situation is one of gradual development, where one’s attitude grows in scope, one’s attitude expands from this basic recognition of suffering and fear of it, to the attitude of a middling individual who comes to understand that this suffering is all over samsara and the whole thing has to be transcended. This is also a very good attitude and is necessary, but still it has to be expanded further to be the attitude of a bodhisattva to the recognition that just as one is 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 48 suffering, so is everyone else and it is not enough to save oneself alone.  If all of these three attitudes arise at the same time that’s wonderful for a practitioner. But even if they don’t, it’s fine if you slowly progress through them—but that development has to be genuine. It’s important to understand that these three levels do not supersede each other. One should not think that the greater individual has no need of the fear and renunciation that is present in the lesser two stages. These stages include and add on to each other—they do not replace each other.  
 
 49   Chapter 4  Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta  IV. CULTIVATING RELATIVE BODHICHITTA  A. EXCHANGING ONESELF FOR OTHERS  11. All suffering begins with wanting happiness    for yourself.   Perfect Buddhas arise with the intention to benefit    others.   Therefore, to fully exchange your happiness  For the suffering of others is the practice of   bodhisattvas.   his verse deals with how relative bodhichitta is cultivated in meditation practice. Fundamentally, this consists of exchanging oneself for others. This verse means that usually whatever we may say, we are really only concerned with our own happiness and we don’t care whether other people are happy or not; that is okay if they are happy, but it is also okay if they are not. Our basic attitude is, “I need to be happy, I need to be free of misery and that’s all I need.” Such an attitude is of no use whatsoever. What we need to do at the present moment is experience a total change of attitude. We have to flip this attitude around so completely that we actually get to the point where we don’t care at all if we are happy—it’s all right if we are and it’s all right if we’re not. However, we definitely care whether others are happy. This change has to be genuine, it has to be total to the point that we are actually T 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 50 willing to exchange any experience of happiness we undergo for the suffering of others.  We must truly realize, “All suffering begins with wanting happiness for yourself.” As long as we are trying to achieve our own happiness, our own welfare, regardless of what we do to accomplish this, it will never ever work because cherishing only ourselves prevents us from being happy. We will never be happy as long as we are trying to be happy; we will never be free of suffering as long as we are trying to be free ourselves from suffering.   The only alternative is the second line, “Perfect Buddhas arise from the intention to benefit others.” The only people who are actually happy are the buddhas. And the cause of buddhahood, the cause of the happiness of buddhas, is that they have absolutely no concern whatsoever for their own happiness and are only concerned with providing the happiness to others. In other words, if you wish to be happy, you must give up the attempt to be happy and be only concerned with the happiness of others. Therefore, this change of attitude and the result of a total exchange of concern for self with concern for others is the practice of a bodhisattva.   This 11th verse gives instruction on the meditation of relative Bodhichitta. The next ten verses give instruction on the post-meditation practices connected with the cultivation of relative bodhichitta.   B. POST-MEDITATION PRACTICES OF  RELATIVE BODHICHITTA  12. If someone, out of great desire, seizes all your wealth   Or makes another do so,  To dedicate body, possessions, and all virtue of    the three times  To this person is the practice of bodhisattvas.   
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 51 This verse deals with how we should react to the aggression of others, in this case with theft. Normally, when someone steals something from us, we become quite upset and angry, possibly to even to the point of fighting with them physically when trying to get the things back. Doing this will probably cause harm to the other person and most definitely cause great harm to ourselves. The approach of a bodhisattva is exactly the opposite. A bodhisattva’s approach is not only to let the person get away with it, but to dedicate everything that we have that is good to that person. The logic behind this is the recognition that when someone steals something from us, they do it because they want whatever it is they are stealing. If we think about it, they are not to blame for this because they have obviously lost control of their mind to the disturbing emotion of attachment and they have no freedom over mind; otherwise they would not be doing what they are doing. If we really consider this, then instead of getting angry, we will feel some compassion for that person. And this absence of anger and the attitude of compassion causes us to make the aspiration that person will really possess all the things they seem to want. Thinking this way makes us to have the aspiration that they will lose their jealousy of your situation and therefore have a body, health, and wealth like yours, and so forth.   Beyond that, we also make the aspiration that they will enjoy the results of all our virtue. Whatever virtue we have accumulated in the past, whatever virtue we accumulate in the present and whatever virtue we will accumulate in the future, that they enjoy the results of this and that they are benefitted by and enjoy what they have stolen from us and not reap the negative karma from having done so. So, this aspiration and dedication to those who steal from us, or incite others to steal from us, is the practice of a bodhisattva in that situation.   
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 52 13. Though I not having the least fault, Even though my head is severed by others,  To take on their negative deeds with compassion   is the practice of bodhisattvas.   The next verse deals with post-meditation practice of relative bodhichitta in the situation of being murdered and how a bodhisattva reacts to this situation. The situation specified here is that we are being physically abused, possibly even being murdered, and it is not because we did anything wrong. The situation is that the bodhisattva is totally innocent of any kind of provocation, but “Even though my head is severed by others.” We have done nothing whatsoever and someone is killing us. The reaction of a bodhisattva in this situation is, “To take on their negativity with compassion.”  In this situation where we are being attacked, a genuine bodhisattva realizes that the reason the person is doing this is because the attacker is obviously totally consumed by ignorance and aggression. However, a bodhisattva in this situation should not feel anger, but have a feeling of profound sadness that someone could actually do such a thing. In experiencing that sadness, a bodhisattva will naturally make the aspiration that the murderous person not reap the results of this action and any other actions which were performed. The bodhisattva actually wants that only he or she will experience the karmic results of that person’s killing and that the other person will not experience the negative karma of the action.12 This type of aspiration is  12. See Appendix D on page 102 for a description of what is necessary to accrue negative karma. 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 53 what marks the reaction of a genuine bodhisattva in this situation.  We are discussing the post-meditation training in relative bodhichitta. As we saw, the emphasis in the presentation of this training is on how to transform negativities onto the path of a bodhisattva. We dealt with theft and being murdered and now we are going to deal with the third situation of being libeled or slandered.  14. Although someone broadcasts throughout the triple  universe A legion of slander about you, In return, with a mind full of loving-kindness  To tell of their good qualities is the practice of    bodhisattvas.  Generally speaking, in our daily life there are always problems occurring with all kinds of external mishaps and abuse. We tend to react to these internally with attachment and aggression. If we give in to this tendency, then our state of mind and our manner of conduct becomes diametrical opposite of the intention of a bodhisattva because we allow ourselves to be totally swept away by our disturbing emotions. On the other hand, if we do not allow ourselves to be swept away by disturbing emotions in mishaps, then the mishaps themselves strengthen us and become our friends on the path. It is these friends who speak behind our back who unknowingly increase our positive qualities associated with the path. It is for these reasons that working with mishaps is emphasized in this text.  The first line says, “Although someone broadcasts throughout the triple universe.” Now “someone” here could be a competitor who is angry at us or it could be someone who is a loved companion. When it says “a legion of slander 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 54 about you” it means that they are really saying terrible things about you that you can’t stand. Now literally it is impossible for anyone to actually publish slander about you that would circulate throughout the cosmos, but this metaphor is that the person is making a really intense effort to make sure that everyone possible hears this slander about you. In this situation it would be normal for a person to react by thinking, “This is really bad. The person who is doing this is really evil,” and to get angry at them, become spiteful, and think about how to strike back. However, if we react to this slander with aggression, then we have a big problem on the bodhisattva path.  It is appropriate for a bodhisattva under these circum-stances to not react with aggression or with actual verbal abuse, but to have a mind full of loving-kindness and tell of the positive qualities of the slanderer.  This reaction of a bodhisattva comes from the bodhisattva’s recognition that if someone is slandering them, it is because they are an ordinary person and therefore under the power of ignorance, greed, aggression, jealousy, arrogance, and so forth. If we recognize why someone would act negatively, then this recognition causes us to change our attitude. We no longer regard them as deserving our scorn, but more of deserving our compassion. The consequent activity of a bodhisattva would be not to deride the person but in fact praise their good qualities in answer to that person’s derision and slander.  15. Although in a gathering of many people, Someone uses abusive words and exposes your hidden faults,  Seeing them as a spiritual friend, and  To bow with respect to them is the practice    of bodhisattvas.  In the previous verse the situation was of slander said more or less behind our back and trying to spread that rumor as far 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 55 and wide as possible. In this verse we are dealing with abuse that is right in our face; the situation is still public but, in this case, we are the person being spoken about.  Verse 15 begins with the setting being that there are many, many people around who know you, and therefore it is much worse than being abused in private because all of these people who are around hear what this person says about us and they will remember it. The person who is abusing us could be a friend or someone we greatly dislike—it doesn’t matter. The abuse is really harsh verbal abuse exposing what is wrong with us and really saying terrible things about us that may or may not be true. In this situation, almost any ordinary person will become enraged, but a bodhisattva must not. There is a real temptation to find all sorts of reasons or justification for our anger and our reaction. For example, we may think that since we are in the middle of a crowd of people and so-and-so is saying such terrible things about us that if we don’t reply to this, everyone will assume it is true. So, the big problem in this situation is our embarrassment and we are in the middle of an extremely bad situation. Bodhisattvas must not allow themselves to be overpowered by this embarrassment and the anger that it brings on and must not respond with abuse that corresponds to what the person is saying.   Rather than becoming upset about the terrible things are being said about us with everyone listening in, a bodhisattva deals with this by thinking that maybe what they are saying could really be true. We should think, “Maybe he is showing me something I need to know which I can’t see for myself. Maybe, in fact, the person is saving me from some future danger.” Even if what that person says is not true and we don’t possess that particular defect at that particular moment, a bodhisattva should consider that maybe it is a warning of something that lies in wait for us in the future.   In any case, this kind of criticism can always be viewed as an encouragement to cultivate further mindfulness, further 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 56 attentiveness, and further care in our conduct. Therefore, it is appropriate to regard even this most extreme situation of slander and abuse as instructions from a spiritual friend to protect us from our own defects.  There is a story to be found in the biography of the writer of this text, Ngülchu Thogme that illustrates what he is talking about here. Generally speaking, ngülchu is the Tibetan word for “mercury” and is also the name of the place where he lived. It is actually near the town of Sakya, the seat of the Sakya Lineage. Ngülchu Thogme used to travel back and forth between Sakya and Ngülchu. One time when he was traveling with a retinue of monks, there were bandits hidden in a pass, lying in wait for them to steal all their possessions. There were quite a number of monks with Ngülchu Thogme, but nevertheless the bandits got them under their control and were dividing all their stuff. While they were dividing everything they had stolen, one bandit laid his sword down. One of the monks thought he could slowly manage to pick up the sword and make use of it before any bandit noticed. So, he was edging his way very slowly toward the sword. Thogme noticed what the monk was doing and scolded him, “What are you doing that for? Why are you getting angry? Put that back.”   This next verse deals with a family member or someone very close to us who turns against us. It says:  16. Although another, who is as cherished as your child, Takes you for an enemy, Like a mother whose child is gravely ill,  To love them even more is the practice of bodhisattvas.  This situation of someone very close to us turning against us is fairly common and it differs from a situation in which someone we don’t know or dislike and harms us. When a stranger does this to us it is not heart-wrenching. But in this situation with someone we love and cherish very dearly turns 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 57 against us and treats us as though we had been hurting them. We usually become very angry and very, very hurt. This verse, however, tells us not to view the situation in the conventional way, but to take a totally different approach and treat them, “like a mother whose child is gravely ill, and to love them even more.” The person’s aggression against us should be seen as a symptom of an illness of disturbing emotions which has taken hold of that person. Just as if a child becomes so physically ill and becomes delirious and starts to attack his mother who is trying to nurse and protect him, the mother will not respond unkindly or try to hurt the child back but will have even more love and concern for the child, recognizing that the child must be very ill. In the same way, when someone we love turns against us, we should not respond with harshness and try to match their abuse, but we should see them as ill with disturbing emotions—with the illness of ignorance and anger—and we should respond with even more compassion and even more loving-kindness.   17. Although a person who is your equal or less Through pride seeks to defame you, To respect them as you have for a teacher and  To place them on your crown is the practice of    bodhisattvas.  The next situation described is one of abuse by a relative stranger. In this verse we are being derided and insulted by someone who is our social equal or social inferior in position and qualities. It would be easier to tolerate the abuse from a person who was our social superior. In this verse, however, we are being actively put down by someone one who regards us as inferior.   This person is treating us as though we were his or her absolute inferior and it would be normal to respond with jealousy, arrogance and irritation, and possibly even hatred. But the next line says that as a bodhisattva we should treat 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 58 this person with respect as we would have for a lama and to place them on the crown of our head.  Rather than responding in the conventional manner, we should consider the possibility that the person might actually have qualities that make it appropriate for him or her to treat us in this way and for us to accept the situation without feeling we have to change it. We should have as much respect for that person and to treat him as we would treat our root guru.13  The six verses we have just discussed deal with the situation of being abused by others by theft, murder, verbal abuse coming from enemies, friends, strangers and so forth. The point in these verses is basically to learn not to respond in turn with aggression or abuse, but respond with more love and compassion than before. The result is that we develop patience and learn to relinquish arrogance.   The next verses deal with situations in which it is necessary to have courage under difficult conditions.  18. Although immersed in poverty and always scorned,  Plagued by grave illness and evil spirits too, Not losing heart but taking on the negativities  And suffering of all beings is the practice of    bodhisattvas.  This verse describes a situation where we are beset from all directions. First, we may be poor and have trouble making ends meet. Because of this, we could sometimes be abused or despised by others. Not only that, but we can be very sick being tormented by a variety of illnesses and also being haunted by spirits, so that we actually see terrifying things and feel moments of unaccountable terror and so forth. The normal way to react to this situation is with complete panic  13. In Tibetan Buddhism one often shows one’s respect for one’s root guru by visualizing them on the top of one’s head. 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 59 and to forget all about the desire to practice Dharma. These obstacles also make us lose any confidence in our own ability to accomplish or succeed in any way in the world.   This 18th verse says that we should not react to extremely troubling situations with self-pity, but rather rejoice in all of our problems and actually take joy in everything that is happening. A bodhisattva in a terrible situation takes the attitude thinking, “Well, I’m really glad all of this is happening to me and not to anybody else. In fact, may this only happen to me. May all of the causes of such mishaps, which are wrong-doing that others have accumulated, only ripen in me. May this result of suffering, happen to only me.” This type of attitude totally destroys self-pity.   A lot of difficult circumstances and mishaps happen to us and therefore they must be taken onto the path. While under normal conditions these can cause us to diminish the power of our bodhichitta, it is possible to bring these difficulties onto the path. But sometimes good and pleasant things happen to us and these pleasant circumstances can also lead to the development of disturbing emotions and lead to the impairment of our bodhichitta. This is covered in the next verse.  19. Although famous, with crowds bowing down, And being affluent as the god of wealth, Seeing the riches of samsara as insubstantial and To have no arrogance is the practice of bodhisattvas.  Pleasant circumstances also impair our bodhichitta so that if we are “famous, with crowds bowing down and being affluent as the god of wealth” we must be careful. If we are respected and congratulated by many people for our great wealth and influence, the text reminds us not to become arrogant in this situation. It is very easy to become used to enjoying the respect and attention of many people and 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 60 thinking, “Well, I am so famous. Everyone looks up to me and likes me.” This is a big problem for a bodhisattva. In the same way, if we become wealthy enough so that we feel totally independent and in control of everything thinking, “I don’t need anybody. I’m in charge of all of this, and I’m not afraid of anyone. I will tell them what to do.” This also will impair our bodhichitta. Whether we receive great respect or great wealth, we need to be very careful to always apply our mindfulness and attentiveness. This mindfulness and attentiveness in this situation consist of always recognizing the true nature of the situation.   There are many wealthy persons who appear from time to time and there are many people who become famous and acquire great adoration of other people. None of these situations has any consequence whatsoever. No wealth or fame will last because they are both impermanent, so putting effort into acquiring them has no real point. If we recognize the fact that regardless of what our situation may be, ultimately wealth and fame is totally meaningless and nothing to be proud of at all. Even if we have the wealth of Vaishravana,14 we can’t keep this wealth at death. Realizing this will prevent us from slipping into arrogance.   The above verse dealt with the situation of receiving respect and affluence and how we should prevent either of these situations becoming harmful to ourselves and others through a recognition of the real nature of the situation. This verse dealt with external conditions. The next two verses deal more with internal situations, particularly with our motivation. The two disturbing emotions that are the most harmful to us in the development and maintenance of bodhichitta are aggression and attachment. The point of the  14. Vaishravana, also known as Jambhala is traditionally known as the god of wealth and symbolically therefore represents the richest person in the world. He is also the Northern guardian of the world and often is depicted carrying a mongoose. 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 61 next two verses is that we have to learn to tame these two disturbing emotions.  20. Not having tamed your enemy anger In trying to tame external enemies, they will simply  multiply.  Therefore, with an army of loving-kindness and  compassion   To tame your mind-stream is the practice of    bodhisattvas.  Whenever aggression arises in us, it is necessary to recognize it as an enemy, as something that can really harm us and that we must fight and tame it because if we do not, our aggression will cause conflict with others. This verse suggests that dealing with aggression by becoming angry will simply exacerbate the situation. Traditionally, it is described as if you kill one enemy to get rid of him, then at least three members of his family will then try to kill you. If you succeed in killing all three of them, then six members of the extended family will be out to kill you and so forth. There is no way that your enemies will become fewer in number if you employ aggression—they will only increase.15 So, the only true way to win this war is to get at the root of the conflict which is to tame the aggression that is inside you. The text suggests that we, “Therefore, with an army of loving-kindness and compassion tame our mind-stream.” The only armed forces that can tame aggression which is the only true enemy are the armed forces of loving-kindness and compassion. These are the only possible remedy or antidote to aggression. Thus, a bodhisattva tames aggression by employing loving-kindness and compassion.  15. This description of killing, of course, applies to any kind of aggression. For example, if you insult one person, he or she will likely then insult you. If you respond with belittling them, they may insult you and your family and friends and so on.

 62  21. Desired objects are just like drinking salt water As much as you enjoy them, that much does your    craving increase.  As much as you enjoy them, that much does your    craving increase.  To give up immediately all things  That give rise to attachment is the practice    of bodhisattvas.  Verse 21 deals with taming attachment, which is the worst of all the disturbing emotions. This verse discusses the normal situation with regard to things and activities we enjoy. We do something because it is fun and we like it, but we never get enough satisfaction from it because the nature of having a good time is that it makes us want to have more of a good time or have the same good time again. And the more we do it, the more and more we want to do it. It is just like when we drink salt water to quench our thirst, the salt water instead of quenching our thirst, makes us more and more thirsty. So, if we allow ourselves to give in to craving, we will never have enough of the desired object and we will never be happy because this craving will take hold of our whole life. The solution to this attachment or clinging is the instruction “to give up immediately all things that give rise to attachment.”  Since the more we indulge in desiring attractive people or situations, the worse it gets and it is appropriate to react to it as soon as it arises and give it up immediately. Whatever it is we want to do, just totally let go of it because at that point it is still small enough to handle and hasn’t snow-balled into something which will be extremely difficult to give up.   This completes the section of this text dealing with training in relative bodhichitta. You will remember that there were two sections, first there is the description of the main meditation practice of exchanging of oneself for others and 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 63 then there were ten verses dealing with the post-meditation practice. Verse 11 concerned exchanging oneself for others and verses 12 through 21 dealt with the post-meditation practices to engage in relative bodhichitta. These ten verses discuss a variety of situations such as being put down or abused by others which can produce disturbing emotions in us, and how we should not to allow disturbing emotions to arise but to respond with mindfulness, alertness, loving-kindness, and compassion. Also covered in these ten verses were situations such as being very wealthy or very poor and so forth and how we should work with these situations. There were also ways to deal with situations that are internal, such as the disturbing emotions of aggression and attach-ment within ourselves.   The basic emphasis in these ten last verses was how to deal with conditions that create disturbing emotions and the importance of maintaining loving-kindness, compassion, and patience in post-meditation.  Questions  Question: In the verse about someone stealing from us, it seems that if we allow that person to get away with it and enjoy the fruits of the stealing and not have any karmic responsibility for this act isn’t this not helping the individual. Rinpoche:  The context of this presentation of training ourselves is to reverse the attitude of cherishing ourselves more than others. When a bodhisattva is well practiced or trained so that this reversal of this self-cherishing attitude is stabilized, then he or she must engage in a variety of methods to benefit others. For example, in the case of the bodhisattva known as “Captain Courageous,” who killed a man who was going to kill 500 people by drilling a hole in the boat in the 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 64 middle of the ocean.16 The distinguishing feature of this particular action by a bodhisattva is that the bodhisattva’s motivation must be so genuine that there is no self-interest in what is done. If the motivation is genuine and if there is sufficient wisdom (prajna) to be able to see what the results or karma of an action will really be, then even such an extreme action will not be wrong-doing, but will be beneficial. So, there is a distinction between training one’s attitude and actually being able to benefit others. Question: Would you speak about leaving a situation or place because the situation creates disturbing emotions that disturb our mind rather than remaining in the environment because it may make others happier? Rinpoche: The main emphasis of these teachings on mind training is to train our mind in such a way that we will react in a genuine and appropriate manner to the disagreeable behavior or abuse of others. Training our mind here means taming the disturbing emotions. We spoke about what we must do to tame our mind so that we are not overpowered by our disturbing emotions. If we are in a situation where we will be overpowered by disturbing emotions, it is useless to remain in that situation simply as an act of courage because we won’t be able to withstand the disturbing emotions and will achieve nothing by remaining there in that situation. Question: Rinpoche, could you say something more about arrogance, what it is and how it is recognized? Rinpoche: In the Abhidharma arrogance or pride is divided into seven different kinds of pride. But basically, pride consists of the thought, “I am superior. I am special.” It is a comparative attitude where we think, “I am better than someone else.” The context of this could be “I am far superior in understanding and practicing the Dharma than so-and-so,” or it could be a mundane feeling like, “I am  16. This story is of Captain Mahakurunika killed an evil merchant wanting to sink a ship with hundreds aboard with a sword is told in the Skillful Means Sutra. 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 65 superior to my boss or teacher.” We can then divide pride into great pride, medium pride and little pride. Great pride is when you think that you are better than someone who is way better than you. Medium pride is when you think that you are better than someone who is actually your equal. And little pride is when you regard yourself better than somebody who is actually inferior to you. Then there is what is called “slight pride,” where you regard yourself just slightly better than somebody who is really your inferior. Then there is “perverted pride” where your basis for pride is something that is nothing to be proud of, like thinking, “I possess no other good qualities, but I am very fast at killing flies.” The point of working with any kind of pride is to look at yourself and to look at how you think and act. And if you have pride, then recognize it as a defect. Question: Could you talk a little more about the two situations where someone is abusing you verbally and when someone is harming you physically. Rinpoche: In the text these two attitudes are designed for two slightly different situations. The attitude of viewing someone who is abusing you as your root guru is appropriate if their abuse or criticism leads to exposure of your hidden faults either to your face or behind your back, but this is not true in a physical attack. Normally, the conventional thing is to say, “Why are they saying that about me?” Rather we should think, “Is it true or not?” In other words, viewing it as instruction, as the exposure of a hidden defect. Whether we have the defect or not, it is an opportunity to look and see if there is something we have been missing about our own character. So, the idea is to view that situation as the basis for the cultivation of mindfulness and attentiveness, and this gives us more knowledge about ourself.  The second situation is where someone is physically harming you. Then it is recommended that you take the same attitude that a mother would take with a child who, in a delirium, would try to attack the mother. Because the person 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 66 who is hurting you is delirious with disturbing emotions, they are not mentally right and in that sense their actions are not deliberate. By seeing them as being ill, we view them as someone who has to be healed rather than as someone who has to be punished or destroyed. Question: Rinpoche, I was wondering if you would say something about seeing someone hurt someone else? Rinpoche: Well, the main thing in that situation is to very carefully examine the true nature of what is occurring and to make sure that whatever you decide to do is in fact appropriate and harms no one and is of genuine and not just apparent benefit. This will depend entirely upon the specifics of the situation. The main thing in this situation is to avoid the naive labeling of one person as a friend and the other person as the enemy. This decision of having compassion for only one person on one side in the situation is not a dharmic attitude or reaction. A dharmic attitude would be to recognize that the situation requires us to assist both people. If we have to protect both by preventing the one from doing something to the other, that’s fine, but it has to be with the motivation of helping both of them. Question: Let’s say we make a mistake and then torturing thoughts of regret come up. Then we just look at the thought and think, “Well, that’s just a thought that comes and goes.” I have the feeling that maybe emptiness is a cop-out of the situation and I really shouldn’t torture myself more so that I get the point. Rinpoche: When you make a mistake, then recognize that you have made a mistake and then think, “Oh, I made a mistake,” then this is not a problem, this is not going to hurt you. What isn’t good is after having recognized your mistake, you continue dwelling on this, saying, “Oh, I am bad. I am very bad.” That isn’t good because it doesn’t lead to anything except your own suffering. What is more appropriate is that when you recognize that you have made a mistake, you simply try not to do it again. Then you don’t have to torture yourself. 
Cultivating Relative Bodhichitta 
 67  It is necessary to take the responsibility of being your own teacher in this regard and to take the responsibility of being strong enough to decide what you are going to do and what you are not going to do. Because you are an ordinary person, you occasionally slip when you do something. When you do something you don’t want to do, simply recognize it, and don’t do it again. Question: You mentioned in the example of Captain Courageous that a bodhisattva would even go so far as to kill to protect someone. Rinpoche: The first and most important thing is your motivation. Your motivation in doing such a drastic act has to be very clear and genuine. When you do something, sometimes you can have a bad motivation and sometimes you can have a genuine motivation. For example, if you see someone walking into the street with oncoming traffic and you pull him back in order to become some kind of hero and to acquire some kind of fame, this is not very good. If you get involved in a situation out of compassion because you really want to protect someone, that is an appropriate action.   Secondly, you also have to make sure that you really can help or protect someone. If you are getting involved in a situation that is only going to make things worse, that is not an appropriate action. For example, you have to know that you can actually protect the person that you are trying to protect and you have to know that you can do it without causing a great deal of unpleasant repercussions for others. It might be possible that you get involved in a situation that might seem at the time to be saving someone from something, but the action might cause them to experience greater suffering in the future, in which case that would not be so good.

 69   Chapter 5  Cultivating Absolute Bodhichitta   V. CULTIVATING ABSOLUTE BODHICHITTA  A. MEDITATION PRACTICE  he main topics presented in this text, The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva, concern relative and ultimate bodhichitta. Up to now we have dealt with the presentation of relative bodhichitta under the two headings of exchanging oneself with others and how to correctly engage in post-meditation practice. Now we are going to start to look at the fifth major section of this text which is absolute bodhichitta.  As we have seen, the essence of relative bodhichitta is loving-kindness and compassion, but we have to be quite specific about what we mean by these terms because we use the words “love” and even “compassion” in many different ways. When we talk about love and compassion, we are not talking about a great attachment to something which will cause disturbing emotions; we are talking about an intel-ligent quality that is characterized by a pure and genuine motivation. It is this type of love and compassion that is referred to as “relative bodhichitta.” And when it is born in our being, we start to cherish other beings far more than we cherish ourselves. Cherishing ourselves over others, among other things, causes our own disturbing emotions to become weaker and weaker. When our disturbing emotions become weaker, of course, we are able to achieve benefits not only for ourselves, but also for others. However, if we ask if this T 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 70 relative bodhichitta is sufficient, the answer is “no.” Absolute bodhichitta must also be cultivated and for that reason it is presented in this chapter.  Verse 22 explains the practice of absolute bodhichitta and discusses the two steps in developing absolute bodhichitta.  22. Things as they appear are your own mind; From beginningless time, the mind’s nature has been free of fabricated extremes. Knowing this, not being taken in by the appearances  Of subject and object is the practice of bodhisattvas.  The first step in understanding ultimate or absolute bodhichitta is to realize that appearances are not anything other than mind. The second step in understanding ultimate bodhichitta is to realize that mind is not anything other than emptiness. If we fully realize these two points, then we will develop the wisdom which realizes the true nature of phenomena—ultimate truth of phenomena.  There are two ways to go about resolving that appearances are nothing other than mind. What is referred to by “appearances” here are all of the images our eyes see, the sounds our ears hear, the smells we smell, the tastes we taste, the bodily sensations that we experience, as well as all the thoughts, feelings, and dreams that appear in our mind. The objects of the six consciousnesses are referred to here as “appearances.”17 We normally take these to be external to ourselves and thereby create attachment and dislike for them depending upon whether we perceive them as welcoming or threatening. While we believe them to be external to ourselves, in fact, they are not outside us. They arise in our mind because the sensory experience is based on the karmic  17. See Appendix C on page 94 for a description of the eight consciousnesses. 
Cultivating Absolute Bodhichitta 
 71 latencies (Tib. bakchak) that have been stored in our mind since beginningless time. The example that is given to explain this is that appearances that we experience are no more external to us than the appearances we experience during a dream. Regardless of the vividness of the images in a dream, regardless of how pleasant or unpleasant they may be, they are in fact nowhere other than simply images in our mind.18   A second way to determine that appearances are not anything other than mind is that the Buddha has directly taught this in some sutras and also, we can through an elaborate analysis to determine that appearances are not other than our own mind in, for example, the reasonings of Nagarjuna. Yet, as we do this it is very hard to experience this directly for an ordinary person using logical reasoning. This is because the emphasis of logical reasoning is based upon the notion of how we experience appearances rather than what we actually experience in our mind.   When the verse says that appearances are not other than mind, it is primarily referring to disturbing emotions, thoughts, feelings, and so forth that pass through the mind. The third line says, “Knowing this, do not be taken in by appearances” means that the appearances of disturbing emotions, thoughts, and so forth are not our main problem or whatever is determine through logical reasoning. It is not the appearances themselves that bind us, but it is the disturbing emotions and thoughts that we create on top of the appearances that cause us to remain in samsara and also prevent us from attaining liberation from samsara. In other  18. Thrangu Rinpoche has explained this in much greater detail. Briefly, a very young child just learning to talk can be told “that is a chair” and then the child will immediately recognize a chair even if it is made up of many different materials, or is an elaborate throne, or even just several slabs carved into a rock face. They know all these are “chairs” because they had been exposed to all these appearances in many previous lifetimes and these were stored in the eighth consciousness. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 72 words, the sensations that we generate upon contact with things—sensations of pleasure, pain and so forth—and also all of the various disturbing emotions that we generate basis of this contact as well as positive mental states such as compassion and so forth, are the appearances that we can directly experience as our own mind. Therefore, the text says, “Things as they appear are your own mind” However, we might still have the idea that this mind, which is the nature of all our experience, is something solid and real and so the text goes on and says, “From beginningless time, the mind’s nature has been free of fabricated extremes.”  If the mind were a solid thing, it could somehow be damaged or harmed by disturbing emotions which are part of the mind. Yet the mind in its nature is free of elaboration which means that it cannot be said to truly exist, it does not possess any quality or characteristic that would justify the statement that it exists, and it cannot be said to be non-existent. That is called “the transcendence of elaborations of existence and non-existence,” or simply the transcendence of extremes.   Some practitioners may have the belief that when you realize the nature of the mind, then at that point the mind becomes transcendent or free of elaborations which it wasn’t before. This is not the case. The mind in itself is totally unchanging and cannot be improved by realization, nor can it in any way be damaged or harmed in its nature by falling into samsara. The nature of mind19 is totally without defect and this recognition does not affect the nature of the mind.  19. When we talk of the “nature of mind” we are referring to the essence of mind which has been unchanged since it first appeared (many incarnations ago) but since then it has had many, many thoughts, feelings, etc. It is like the “nature” or “essence of water which is a H2O molecule that is unchanging, yet its “appearances” have been solid ice, part of a river, or clouds many, many times. 
Cultivating Absolute Bodhichitta 
 73  However, if we examine the mind carefully in meditation we will recognize that the objects of attachment and aversion have no true existence, that the mind itself has no true existence, and with this realization we will not try to solidify the appearances of subject and object. And the text next says: “Knowing this, not to be taken in by appearances of subject and object is the practice of bodhisattvas.”  This presentation is the characteristic of a sutra presentation of ultimate bodhichitta which is somewhat vague and does not give detailed instructions on how to realize it. While it is a valid style of presentation, neverthe-less, it is important to understand that the ultimate bodhichitta that is being presented here is identical to the state of Mahamudra.   But why is this absolute bodhichitta called “bodhichitta” in the first place? The reason is that when we recognize this ultimate nature of mind, we will automatically and effortlessly develop great compassion for all beings because we see that all those who lack this realization have the same nature as us. There is a great poignancy to the fact that our ignorance, our confusion comes from a foundation that is perfect clarity and emptiness. Then we will clearly see the workings of the disturbing emotions and the amount of suffering that beings go through. We will then automatically develop great compassion for them. It is also called “bodhichitta” because under normal circumstances, if we try to eradicate or pacify the disturbing emotions, we become very uncomfortable and our efforts are usually be quite ineffective. If, on the other hand, we recognize dharmata (the true nature of phenomena) then automatically our disturbing emotions will decrease and we will start to live in a state of harmony with everyone else. This then is what is referred to in the Refuge Ordination Ceremony which defines Dharma as “peace and supreme passionlessness.” This phrase means essentially absolute bodhichitta. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 74  The verse above was essentially an explanation of the meditation practice associated with absolute bodhichitta. Next the text presents the post-meditation practice as-sociated with absolute bodhichitta.  B. THE POST-MEDITATION PRACTICE ASSOCIATED WITH ABSOLUTE BODHICHITTA  Fundamentally, post-meditation in this context is learning how to properly relate to experiences of pleasant and unpleasant objects, which, if not related to properly, will inspire attachment and anger. Previously in the discussion of post-meditation practice of relative bodhichitta, there were remedies for these situations. One can say that the following sections of the text are somewhat repetitious, yet if we look carefully, we will see that there is a subtle difference in the type of instruction from absolute bodhichitta and that was presented in the discussion of relative bodhichitta.   Previously, the remedies given for the arising of attachment and aversion were based on a conscious decision to relinquish these states based upon the recognition of their defects. For example, we were taught previously that we must abandon aggression because it will just lead to more and more suffering and to subdue it was done with the great forces of loving-kindness and compassion. We learned that the disturbing emotions of attachment or desire were compared to us drinking salt-water to quench our thirst. We were told that if we just stop before drinking salt water, it is easier to give it up. These were the remedies that were based on the relative bodhichitta.   With absolute bodhichitta we take the approach that the objects which created the disturbing emotions from the beginning have been without true existence. So, the first verse of this section is concerned with attachment and the objects that create attachment.  
Cultivating Absolute Bodhichitta 
 75 23. When meeting with a pleasing object, See it as a rainbow in summer Having a beautiful appearance, but it is not real.  To give up attachments is the practice of bodhisattvas.  One of the first things that we experience after arising from a session of meditating on absolute bodhichitta is that we will see, hear, smell, taste, or touch something beautiful that sweeps us away and we will very likely think, “Oh, this is so beautiful,” and become attached to it. But the text says, “When meeting with a pleasing object, see it as a rainbow in summer.” Whatever it is that we are perceiving is in that sense beautiful and desirable, just like a rainbow—but no matter how gorgeous the colors of the rainbow it is totally insubstantial and one could say, “totally useless.” This is true of many other objects of attachment including people, thoughts, and ideas. We cannot possess a rainbow by taking it home with us and we cannot find any use for a rainbow, and we certainly cannot consume it. In the same way, anything we experience as an experience in its nature has no true existence. The last two lines are that it is not real so we should give up our attachment to it. We must relinquish attachment in a manner of absolute bodhichitta, which is a superior method for dealing with desirable objects and situations and is therefore the practice of a bodhisattva.   The next verse deals with the analogous situation of when we encounter something unpleasant.  24. Diverse sufferings are like a child’s death in a dream;  To take such delusions as real, how exhausting! Therefore, when encountering difficult situations,  Seeing them as delusions is the practice of bodhisattvas.  Of course, we do encounter lots of pleasant things and it is important to train ourselves to be able to experience these things without being swept away by becoming attached to them. Also, we often encounter extremely unpleasant things, many mishaps, disasters, pain, and so forth. And it is equally 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 76 important not to treat these experiences as having a reality that they do not really possess.  An example of this is that while asleep you have a dream that you have a child born to you which in fact you do not have. Later in this dream you dream that this child dies and you go through a lot of suffering of losing this child during this dream. When you wake up, you realize that there was no child there in the first place, so why were you so upset about the child dying? The point here is that what we take to be suffering at the time does not, in fact, essentially harm us; it is just a passing sadness that really has no substance or meaning and there is no reason to treat these circumstances as a reality that they actually do not have. The verse says, “To take such delusions as real, how exhausting!” The term “how exhausting” refers to a state in which we exhaust ourselves by emotionally investing in circumstances that do not give us much pleasure because they are unreal. By creating these false dramas, we exhaust ourselves all the time. The verse concludes that as a bodhisattva that when encountering difficult situations, we should see them as simply delusions.”  In summary, we have discussed what our behavior should be in situations of the meditation and post-meditation in relation to absolute bodhichitta. Essentially, what was explained is that all appearances are dream-like in our meditation and also in our post-meditation and that we should not develop great attachment and aversion to these delusions.   
 
 77   Chapter 6  Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta  VI. CULTIVATING RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE BODHICHITTA  he sixth major section of the text shows how practicing the six perfection is part of the cultivation of both relative and absolute bodhichitta of a bodhisattva.   A. THE SIX PERFECTIONS (PARAMITAS)  The first set of such practices are the practice of the six perfections (Skt. paramitas), which are presented in a sequential order. Verse 25 discusses the first perfection of generosity.  25. If those aspiring to enlightenment, even give their body  away,  What need to mention giving external objects away. Therefore, without hope of receiving return or positive results   To be generous is the practice of bodhisattvas.  If it is our intention to attain Buddhahood and to help all sentient beings without exception to achieve a state of complete liberation, then there is no question that we must be prepared to be very generous with others. This intention is much greater in scope than the intention of a hearer (Skt. T 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 78 shravaka),20 who wishes to only free him or herself from the confusion of samsara. Being a bodhisattva is an extremely vast undertaking and must be done with an attitude and openness of mind that is appropriate to such a vast undertaking. The bodhisattva has to begin to work on his or her lack of pettiness with the cultivation of generosity.   There are many different kinds of generosity. Perhaps the most common is Dharma generosity, material generosity, and the generosity which gives protection. Material generosity is the principal topic of this verse and covers three levels of giving: “giving,” “great giving” and “really great giving.”  “Giving” in relation to material things means that you give generously something that is appropriate for someone else. “Great giving” is giving things to which you are greatly attached to, such as things that you need or things that are a part of your household, possibly even part of your family. And “really great giving” is doing things like giving someone your head or giving someone your whole body. The point of the really great giving is that you relinquish any concern for yourself and any personal attachment that is so great that the act of giving itself cuts through attachment completely. The second line discusses giving external objects away. If you really and genuinely have the attitude that each and every being is more important than you are and that the achievement of the freedom of other beings is more important than anything else, then you will be prepared to give up anything. However, the motivation for a specific act of generosity has to be totally pure; otherwise it won’t be genuine generosity. The next line points this out by saying we must give “without hope of return or positive result.”  20. The word shravaka literally means “hearer” or a student who listens (to the Dharma teachings). He or she is a Foundation vehicle practitioner who accepts the teachings of the Buddha but has not made the aspiration to help all other sentient beings as a bodhisattva has done.  
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 79  Often when we engage in acts of casual generosity, we are hoping for payback, thinking, “Maybe if I give so-and-so this thing, then in the future so-and-so will give me something back that I will need at that time.” It’s okay to do this, but it’s not an appropriate motivation for someone endeavoring to achieve Buddhahood. Or we may give something with the hope, “If I give so-and-so this object, then I will accumulate much merit that in future lives that I will enjoy a good life.” This is also fine in general, but it is not a cause for reaching Buddhahood or to be a useless act of the first perfection of generosity. For generosity to really be the paramita of generosity, it has to be done without the slightest concern for a reward of any kind to the giver. It has to be done 100% with the intention to benefit the recipient.  In this verse, the treatment of the perfection of generosity is very brief. Longer presentations such as found in The Jewel Ornament of Liberation by Gampopa, there is a fine distinction made between genuine generosity and inappropriate generosity. Generally, we can say it depends upon our motivation and more specifically that it must contain three variables involved in any act of generosity: the purity of the motivation, the appropriateness of the thing given, and the appropriateness of giving it to the recipient. An example of impure motivation is to give something that may harm them or giving something in order to be able to manipulate them. Inappropriate things to give people are such things as poisons and weapons that they might use to harm or kill someone else or that they might use to harm themselves. For example, if someone comes to you and says, “I would really like to kill myself. Will you please give me a gun?” it would not be appropriate to do so. An inappropriate recipient is someone who will not derive any benefit from what you have given them. For example, if a disturbed person asks something from you that they cannot possibly make any meaningful use of, it is inappropriate to 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 80 give it to them. Another example is of a recipient asking you for something that would cause you or others harm.   The second of the six perfections is discipline and this is described in the next verse.  26. If lacking discipline, you cannot even benefit yourself,  Then wishing to benefit others is ridiculous. Therefore, to maintain a discipline With no desire for samsara is the practice of bodhisattvas.  The term “discipline” is tsultrim in Tibetan, which means the proper regulation of one’s conduct. This verse begins, “If lacking discipline, you cannot even benefit yourself.” Then wishing to benefit others is ridiculous.” Proper moral conduct is important because even though we may have an intense desire to be of help to all sentient beings, nevertheless we have up to now developed many habits of wrong-doing over beginningless time. These habits are still going to pop up from time to time. When these habits arise, disturbing emotions will also arise. And regardless of what we have decided to do, if we don’t consciously maintain a code of discipline, we will find ourselves acting in a harmful way. If we act in a way that is actually harmful to others, how can we possibly talk about being of benefit to others? So, it is necessary to constantly remind ourselves of the need to act properly. If we do that, we will accomplish great benefit both for ourselves and eventually for others. We have to constantly remember that actions that arise through habit are not necessarily to be indulged in. If we can maintain this discipline, it leads to all manner of success. Saying that we are helping others while we cannot even take care of our own situation is a lie and is therefore referred to in the text is said to be “ridiculous.” So careful conduct is essential to our practice.  To maintain careful conduct, we need to have a longing for the liberation of ourselves and for others, rather than a 
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 81 longing for things in this lifetime which is very short. So, the next line says we should, “Therefore to maintain a discipline with no desire for samsara.”  The third perfection is patience. Generally speaking, when we practice meditation, we experience some difficulty and yet, at the same time, practice brings us great benefit. We also know that if we don’t practice, we will not receive this benefit. So, it is necessary to have some patience with the difficulties in practice. Shantideva has said, “There is no virtue like patience, just as there is no evil like anger.” This is what is referred to in our text:  27. For bodhisattvas aspiring to a wealth of virtue,  Anything that harms is a treasury of precious jewels.  Therefore, never getting tired and angry, and  Being patient is the practice of bodhisattvas.  “A wealth of virtue” means that we wish to be able to reap the reward of virtue of achieving true benefit for others and ourselves. If we wish to achieve this and reap the benefit of this virtue which involves many difficulties, it is absolutely essential that we cultivate patience.   For patience to be systematically developed there has to be the presence of the conditions that enable us to practice patience. The only true condition that can afford this opportunity is experiencing some kind of mishap, possibly even someone trying to harm us. If something goes wrong, then we have the opportunity to develop patience; if nothing is going wrong, there is no way that we can cultivate patience because there is nothing to be patient with. So, the text says, “Anything that harms is a treasury of precious jewels.”   For a bodhisattva actively involved in practicing, each and every time something goes wrong, it becomes a tremendous opportunity for the cultivation of patience, which is the supreme form of virtue. Rather than viewing an obstacle as a basis for aggression and resentment, a 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 82 bodhisattva views mishap and the abuse of others as tremendous opportunities. And, as a result we should as bodhisattvas, “never be getting tired and angry and be patient.”  The perfections of discipline, diligence, meditation, and knowledge require no particular object, whereas the perfections of generosity and patience do require the presence of an object. Among these two, it is very easy for bodhisattvas to find objects and recipients for their generosity, but it is a little harder for them to find objects requiring them to develop patience because bodhisattvas don’t go around harming others and consequently they experience less aggression from others than other people do. Bodhisattvas really don’t have the opportunity they need to develop patience, unless they are put in a situation in which they are being abused in some way. So, if you find an object that requires you to develop patience, don’t let it slip through your fingers.  28. If shravakas and pratyekabuddhas, working for     their benefit alone, Make efforts as if extinguishing a fire on their head, To develop even more diligence, the source of  good qualities,   That benefit all beings is the practice of bodhisattvas.  This verse deals with the perfection of diligence or joyous effort which is tsöndrü in Tibetan. The main point of this verse is that bodhisattvas need tremendous diligence in their practice. This verse begins by comparing the diligence on the bodhisattva path with the diligence to a shravaka or pratyekabuddha.21 The first two lines states that shravakas  21. A pratyekabuddha or “solitary realizer” is a Foundation level practitioner, who because of previous karma, does not need a guru to help him or her reach enlightenment. 
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 83 and pratyekabuddhas have lesser motivation by only trying to free themselves from samsara in comparison to what bodhisattvas are trying to do. Someone engaged in the bodhisattva path has the intention of liberating themselves as well all other beings. In comparison to the bodhisattva path the intention, the result, the practice, and even the samadhi of the shravakas and pratyekabuddhas are quite small. Even though their practice is less vast in scope, they still practice with the same diligence that they would if their hair caught fire.22 If one’s hair were to catch fire, one would not waste any time in dealing with samsaric things and these Foundation vehicle practitioners display the same diligence in not wasting any time away from their Dharma practice. Then how much more must we practice on path of a bodhisattva, which is vaster in scope and leads to full Buddhahood. The Mahayana path involves vast intention, vast practice, and vast samadhi. How much more appropriate is it therefore that we engage in extreme diligence? Therefore, the third and fourth line says, “To develop even more diligence, the source of qualities that benefit all beings, is the practice of bodhisattvas.” The “good qualities” in this line refers to the positive qualities that benefit all beings meaning that in the bodhisattva path the effort one puts in is not a source of benefit for oneself only but also benefits all beings.   The fifth perfection is meditative concentration or stability:  29. Knowing Vipashyana that is fully settled    in Shamatha Completely conquers all disturbing emotions.   22. From Nagarjuna’s Letter to a Friend, verse 104: “Give up your efforts trying to stop all this as if your hair or clothes had just caught fire. Just do your best to not be born again. No greater goal or need is there than this.”  
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 84 To stay in a one-pointed meditative concentration that    perfectly transcends  The four formless absorptions,23 is the practice   of bodhisattvas.   The usual explanation of meditative concentration is that it consists of the cultivation of Shamatha or “calm abiding” and Vipashyana or “Insight” meditation. Of the six paramitas or perfections, the sixth meditative concentration is concerned with Shamatha meditation. The first syllable of the Tibetan word for Shamatha (Tib. shinay) is shi, which means “peace.” Peace here refers to a state of mind that is free from disturbing emotions, particularly free from arrogance, aggression, and jealousy. The second syllable nay, means “abiding, resting or stillness” indicating that it is a state of non-thought—a state where thoughts are not agitating the mind. We may ask which is ultimately more important, Shamatha or Vipashyana, and the answer is Vipashyana24 because it is Vipashyana meditation that actually conquers the disturbing emotions rather than merely weakening them. However, Vipashyana cannot work alone because Vipashyana can only arise within a thoroughly trained and completely stable Shamatha. Otherwise, Vipashyana experiences will tend to be very ephemeral and will not be of much benefit. The line, “Knowing Vipashyana that is fully settled in Shamatha” means that Vipashyana should be practiced in the context of a thoroughly trained and completely stable Shamatha. With this the disturbing  23. The four absorptions or meditations are: infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothing whatsoever, and neither existence of non-existence. These are the highest meditation in the formless realm in worldly existence. 24. Vipashyana is usually translated as “insight” but it means much more than insight into the mind. It means the meditation to understand the empty or insubstantial quality of the mind and thus the empty nature of all outer phenomena. 
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 85 emotions can actually be conquered. The reason we want to overcome the disturbing emotions is that the nature of disturbing emotions and thoughts is to make us suffer mentally; they also produce further negativity—spitefulness, arrogance, jealousy and so forth—which leads to further suffering. As long as the disturbing emotions have not been pacified, there is no possibility for any kind of true happiness. Since this depends upon a foundation of Shamatha, it is essential that bodhisattvas begin their Vipashyana by cultivating a thorough practice of Shamatha.   Now there are two types of Shamatha: mundane Shamatha and supramundane Shamatha. Mundane Shamatha is the type of meditation when done properly can lead to entering the form and formless realms, and supramundane Shamatha25 is the type of Shamatha that is conducive to creating genuine Vipashyana.   The verse tells us “to stay in meditative concentration (samadhi) that perfectly transcends the four formless ones.” This means that our practice of Shamatha must transcend the mundane boundary of the formless realms. So, we have to begin by thoroughly cultivating a perfect and stable calm abiding or Shamatha. Being diligent in our practice of Shamatha, we then become aware that we the need to gather “the two accumulations” of merit and of wisdom.   Merit is principally accumulated by means of the first five perfections—from generosity on up to meditation—but if the cultivation of these and the resulting accumulation of merit is not joined with the cultivation of the sixth perfection of wisdom, then these five forms of virtue will not really be fully developed into the path of the perfections; they will merely result in common forms of virtue. If practitioners do not develop the true paramitas, this will only lead to a  25. Mundane means “worldly” so mundane Shamatha means on the relative level of reality (the formless realm is still in samsara) and “super-mundane” means “spiritual” so supermundane Shamatha that is on the ultimate level of reality.  
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 86 temporary accumulation of merit. Even the mundane accumulation of merit, of course, is still beneficial. For example, the practice of generosity helps the practitioner accumulate merit improving their karma and they can practice discipline even if it is not on the paramita level and it will still benefit you and others as well.  30. Since perfect enlightenment cannot be attained Through the five perfections if they lack superior  knowledge, To cultivate this knowledge endowed with skillful  means and  The three non-conceptual aspects is the practice of    bodhisattvas.  Our whole approach to the path is to create true and lasting benefit. To be of true benefit to beings, we must achieve the wisdom of omniscience. Until we accomplish this wisdom, we really don’t know exactly what we are doing; as a result we are still too confused to be able to guide beings to liberation. And every other form of help to others, every benefit that is not guiding beings to liberation is short-term help. So, if we are going to achieve our aim, we are going to have to attain full Buddhahood in order to do that. If we want to attain Buddhahood, we must generate genuine prajna, genuine superior knowledge, because it is only with prajna that this can be brought about. So, the third line says we must, “cultivate this knowledge endowed with skillful means and the three non-conceptual aspects.”  This knowledge is essentially the recognition of the true nature of all phenomena. It is described here as “not conceptualizing threefold action.”26 What this means is that whenever we engage in an action, especially when practicing  26. The threefold aspect of a situation is (1) the actor who (2) does the action (3) upon an object or person. 
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 87 one of the five paramitas, we should do so without solidifying any of the three elements of the situation. For example, there are two ways we can perform an act of generosity. We can perform it with the thought, “I exist, he exists and what I am giving him exists,” which is not generosity based on prajna. Or we can perform this same act with the recognition that I have no true existence, he has no true existence and what I just gave him has no true existence. Without that recognition, generosity is not pure and therefore not a true act of the perfection of generosity. Any of the five other perfections has to be joined with this recognition to be a true perfection.   The next to last line mentions that a bodhisattva must cultivate the sixth paramita of intelligence and skillful means. Skillful means are the methods we use when we are practicing the first five perfections. So, the point is that for the practice to be a genuine accumulation of both merit and wisdom it must have these two aspects of wisdom and skillful means or our practice is incomplete.   The next topic among the practice of a bodhisattva is what is called “the four things to be trained in which can be found in the sutras.”  B. THE FOUR PRACTICES FROM THE SUTRAS  Generally, we think of the practice of a bodhisattva as consisting simply of training in the six paramitas and then applying these with our body, speech, and mind. But in the sutras, the Buddha specifically pointed out four areas of training that also need to be focused on.  31. By not examining your own confusion,  It’s possible to act in a non-Dharmic way    while maintaining a practitioner’s guise.  Therefore, always examining your confusion and  To discard it is the practice of bodhisattvas. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 88  The first practice from the sutras is the recognition of our confusion before we can actually eradicate our confusion. To do this we must constantly examine whatever we do, whatever we say, and whatever we think. We think, “What am I doing with my body? What am I saying with my speech? What’s going through my mind?” This examination will expose all forms of confusion and self-deception, and many little non-dharmic actions, non-dharmic speech and non-dharmic motivations. We need this continual examination so that we may be totally dharmic in appearance and yet, if we look carefully, the appearance may not be quite as genuine as it appears to others. Generally speaking, our practice is somewhat mixed with a certain amount of Dharma and a certain amount of non-Dharma. This is true with what we do with our bodies, with what we say, and with what passes through our mind. Now generally, we have virtuous intentions and the intention of bodhichitta, but from time to time we may slip a little. Verse 31 suggest we should therefore, always examine our confusion.  The emphasis on analyzing our own delusion is the role of our spiritual friend who informs us of our mistakes and misdoings. Because of the subtleties that are involved in the differences between students, it is possible that the teacher may not catch everything we are trying to get away with, and we may slip through. So, it’s necessary that we take responsibility for our own defects and work with them through this exhaustive examination.  We all have buddha nature which allows us to eventually reach buddhahood but the problem is that we are more habituated to the cultivation of negative rather than positive qualities and consequently we tend to slip. If we don’t go through this constant checking process, then as the second line says, “It’s possible to act in a non-Dharmic way while maintaining a practitioner’s guise.” 
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 89  What may happen is that we cultivate the appearance of a practitioner, even of a bodhisattva, and we might be able to fool everyone else. But if we look at what we are really doing, we can tell especially in situations where there are many subtle non-Dharmic activities incorporated in our dharmic actions. This verse says that we should, “always examine our confusion and discard it.”  We should not undertake the examination of our defects for just a short time by thinking, “Well, today I am going to look at my faults” or “This year I am going to spend my time looking at my faults.” The problem is that we have been cultivating these defects and wrong-doing over the length of this lifetime and even the length of previous lifetimes and we are very good at it. To counteract these strong habits, we have to constantly be on guard against this, and that’s why the text says: “Therefore always examine your confusion.” We should not just become aware of it and do nothing about it. Having spotted something wrong, it is necessary to recognize it as a defect and drop it totally. This is what is meant by, “To discard these confusions is the practice of bodhisattvas.”  32. If bodhisattvas, through the power of disturbing    emotions, speak of others’ faults, They themselves will be diminished. Therefore, not to mention the faults of those  Who have entered the Mahayana path is the    practice of bodhisattvas.  This verse deals with the speech aspect of the four practices in that are taught in the sutras concerning the situation where one would, “through the power of disturbing emotions, speak of others’ faults.” It is just our nature that, when we have disturbing emotions, we will tend to look for the defects in others, and if we think we find them, we will talk about them. The basic problem here is what is making us do this are the 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 90 disturbing emotions. We tend to look at others’ actions, trying to see if they have any defects and we are constantly speculating about the motivations of others. While we are engaged in this speculation, it seems extremely important to us. But if you think about it, however, it is not important at all because we are fundamentally responsible only for ourselves. It is quite possible that someone else might have a certain defect, but it’s not particularly a big deal if they do from our point of view. This is because any other practitioner is in the same situation we are in—he or she is working on the habit of confusion that has been cultivated over a long period of time. There is no benefit in paying attention to and especially in talking about the defects of others—all it does is promote arrogance, more jealousy, and more anger on our part. If, on the other hand, we look at our own defects, this can be very beneficial because our own defects are things we can fix. As for others, they may or may not have defects, but even if they do, we can’t fix them; even if we see something that is wrong with someone else, we can’t really help. All that will most likely happen is that our own practice will degenerate because our disturbing emotions will be augmented by this getting involved in the defects of others.   Now this verse is explained in the context of Mahayana practice, but it is equally true for Foundation practitioners and is equally true for non-practitioners. In all cases, it is first of all, very good to avoid looking for defects of others and, second of all, to not speak about what defects we think we have found.   33. By wanting gain and honor, arguments will arise and  Activities of listening, reflecting, and meditating will  decline.  Therefore, to give up attachment to one’s household,   Friends, relatives, and donors is the practice of   bodhisattvas.  
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 91 Verse 33 deals with the third practice found in the sutras to relinquish defects, which is becoming attached to friends and patrons. Whether we are a practitioner in general or a bodhisattva, it is possible that we might develop a relationship with patrons, sponsors, or friends who help us. We tend to regard these people as important, as great friends, as being very special indeed. This attachment does not particularly come from the qualities of the person but from our hope for the acquisition of wealth, respect, or honor. The first line says, “By wanting gain and honor, arguments will arise”  Basically, when we become extremely attached to these situations and people because of what we think we can or are already getting from them. This leads to two problems. The first is that the nature of such a relationship is one of conflict, so we will be agitated by constant or intermittent disputes or arguments. The second problem described in the second line is, “Activities of listening, reflecting, and meditating decline.” As soon as we start to chase after wealth and honor, we will not be running after listening to, reflecting, and meditating in our Dharma practice. Rather we will abandon these activities in favor of acquisition and respect. So, it is important for a bodhisattva to “give up attachment to the households, friends, relatives, and donors.”27 So, we have to look at ourselves to see if we are starting to develop this specific type of attachment and if we find that we are, we should drop these attachments.  The first three practices mentioned in the sutras were primarily concerned with mind and especially motivation. The fourth practice concerns negative speech, particularly harsh speech by saying things that hurt others. The basic  27. This phrase does not mean we should simply give up all relationships. Rather it means we should give up any attachments in relationships that could lead to non-dharmic activities. 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 92 point of the verse is that under all circumstances we must simply drop this behavior and not get engaged in it.   34. Harsh words trouble the minds of others And diminish a bodhisattva’s conduct. Therefore, to give up harsh words that are  Not pleasing to others is the practice of bodhisattvas.  There are several different ways we can speak harshly. We can directly say something hurtful to someone. Another way is to say something behind someone’s back that will get back to them. The third way is to disguise our negative thought as a joke to make others even more uncomfortable. Any one of these three ways of speaking qualifies as harsh speech; it doesn’t matter whether the words used are cruel or not—it’s the effect that is important. This effect of speaking these three kinds of harsh speech is to agitate or disturb the minds of others. If they are peaceful, harsh speech will probably make them angry and bringing up arrogance and jealousy into the situation. So, the first wrong aspect of harsh speech is that it hurts others. The second thing wrong with harsh speech is that it hurts us, as mentioned in line two because it will “diminish a bodhisattva’s conduct.”  When doing this practice, it is necessary to maintain the attitude, “I am a bodhisattva. I am a Mahayana practitioner and therefore I must at all times conduct myself appro-priately.” And basically, what that means is to be peaceful, to be subdued, and to always act in a manner that is beneficial and not harmful towards others. If we go against this commitment of not doing or saying things deliberately to hurt others, then our practice degenerates, we start to regress. So, for these reasons and we should “give up harsh words not pleasing to others.”  Again, harsh words that do not please others does not necessarily mean using crude expressions or saying something downright hurtful. Harsh speech could be very 
Cultivating Both Relative and Absolute Bodhichitta 
 93 direct or crude or it could be very subtle and gentle in appearance. However, anything you say which displeases someone else qualifies as harsh speech.  We have now completed the explanation of the various practices of bodhichitta, which consisted of the six perfections and the four practices spoken of in the sutras. Now we will begin with verse 35, which discusses how to train in abandoning disturbing emotions.

Afflicted or Klesha Consciousness  This consciousness is the constant feeling of ego or “I” which permeates all thought and perceptions whether we are thinking about them or not.  8th. Storehouse or Alaya Consciousness  This consciousness has two functions. It organizes the other seven consciousnesses and second it stores all the karmic seeds related every action we take.  Note: This is based on the Mind-only school which has eight consciousness that Rinpoche used in this text. Other schools have only six consciousnesses with the seven and eighth consciousnesses being part of the six mental consciousness.  
 
 95   Chapter 7  How to Abandon  the Disturbing Emotions  VII. ABANDONING THE DISTURBING EMOTIONS  The Seven Points of Mind Training is comprised of seven main topics and in this chapter we begin the seventh section on how to abandon our disturbing emotions.  35. Once habituated to disturbing emotions, it’s difficult  to counter them with remedies. The Noble Being with mindfulness and alertness takes  up the weapon of an antidote. To slay the disturbing emotions of desire and all others  As soon as they arise is the practice    of bodhisattvas.  e begin the bodhisattva practice of eliminating disturbing emotions by explaining why they are so difficult to work with. If we let our disturbing emotions (Skt. kleshas) run wild, we become more and more accustomed to them. And as we become accustomed to them, they become stronger and stronger. At a certain point our disturbing emotions become so strong that even if we apply the appropriate remedy, they become so strong, making it very hard to relinquish them. It doesn’t make any difference which disturbing emotion it is because they are all the same in this respect. So, the first point is not to allow ourselves to get too used to indulging our disturbing emotions. W 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 96  For any particular remedy for the disturbing emotions to be effective, we must have mindfulness and attentiveness. Mindfulness and attentiveness are described in the Abhidharma which makes a distinction between mind and what arises in mind. Mind in the Abhidharma refers the six consciousnesses, particularly the sixth mental conscious-ness. This mental consciousness creates negative disturbing emotions and it also creates positive mental states. What is generated within the mental consciousness are the mental factors or, simply put, the thoughts that arise. These thoughts can be good or can be bad; they can be temporary or continuously there. The most common list of these types of thoughts are the 51 factors which include in Tibetan drenpa, “mindfulness” and in Tibetan shezhin, “attentiveness.”   In this context, mindfulness is defined as not forgetting what is to be accepted and what is to be rejected; it is the recognition that certain courses of action are negative, that certain courses of action that must be taken and what must not be pursued. The continual memory of this is what is referred to in English as “mindfulness.” Attentiveness is the observation of what you are doing as you act; the observation that “this act is appropriate, or this act is inappropriate” and so forth. Mindfulness and attentiveness are very similar but they are also distinct; therefore, they are considered to be two important qualities in Buddhist psychology.  The second line, “The noble being of mindfulness and alertness takes up the weapon of an antidote” gives the image of a person who is a warrior holding weapons. The warrior is used to illustrate this dual quality of mindfulness and attentiveness. The weapons that a person holds are the remedies that are appropriate to eliminate each disturbing emotion.  This is why it is necessary to properly maintain mind-fulness and attentiveness. Shantideva in The Bodhisattvas Way of Life said, “If you lead with mindfulness, attentiveness will follow,” meaning the maintenance of mindfulness will also bring about attentiveness. We do this by constantly looking into 
Abandoning the Disturbing Emotions 
 97 our mind to see if disturbing emotions have arisen. If disturbing emotions have not arisen, then we engage in whatever is necessary to prevent them from arising. If we find that one or more disturbing emotions have arisen, we destroy them immediately which is the practice of a bodhisattva.  If we possess the appropriate remedy for a particular disturbing emotion, then it is easy to abandon it; if we do not have the remedy, then it is almost impossible. Shantideva has said that, “Mental afflictions are like enemies except they are much worse.” If we take care not to harm most enemies and we do things to help and please them, we can over time transform enemies into friends. However, this can never be done with disturbing emotions which will never become your friend under any circumstances. All they will ever do is harm our body and mind in this lifetime and also in all future lives that we have. So, it is a mistake to attempt to befriend our disturbing emotions. This is because if we manage to somehow expel enemies from our territory, they will lie in wait for us and eventually come back to take revenge. But on the positive side if we can manage to expel disturbing emotions, they can’t come back at us as long as we maintain our mindfulness and alertness.  This verse is obviously about the necessity of abandon-ing disturbing emotions as soon as they arise which is the practice of a bodhisattva. Another way to express this important point is the example used by the Kagyu siddhas called “hitting the pig in the snout.” Imagine that you have a garden that is full of beautiful flowers and a pig appears at the fence of the garden and starts to stick its nose in to see if it can get the flowers. Then as soon as the pig sticks its nose in, you take a stick and smack the pig on the nose, the pig will go away. But if you let the pig come into the garden, then you can smack the pig all you want and the only thing you will manage to do is chase it around the garden trampling it and destroying the plants in the process. In the same way, as soon as you start to see the snout of a disturbing emotion, you have to immediately recognize that it is of no benefit to you and also extremely harmful and 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 98 dangerous, and smack it right away. Otherwise, the disturbing emotion will get into the garden of your mind, you will start to enjoy it and think how much fun this disturbing emotion is, and this disturbing emotion will totally trample all your virtuous activities.  A. THE BENEFIT OF HAVING  MINDFULNESS AND ATTENTIVENESS  36. In brief, wherever you are and whatever you do,  While staying continually mindful and alert  And keeping the state of your mind  To benefit others is the practice of bodhisattvas.  Whatever phase we are practicing whether we are in the midst of many people or totally alone, whether we are moving our body or speaking, we should always be attentive and aware of what is going on in our mind. Is our mind in a positive state? Or a negative state? Are disturbing emotions arising? When they arise, are we applying the remedies or are we letting them run wild? Are we being too relaxed with the disturbing emotions? Are we usually in a state with disturbing emotions or in a state without disturbing emotions and so forth? In all these cases we have to constantly attend to this. Being ordinary beings, if we do not apply the appropriate remedies at the right time, our disturbing emotions will start to run our lives. However, if we do apply these antidotes or remedies, then we can weaken the disturbing emotions. So, the application of mindfulness and attentiveness is essential. As the verse says, “While staying continually mindful and alert and keeping the state of your mind to benefit others is the practice of bodhisattvas.”  This verse is emphasizing again that it is absolutely essential that there be the continuous and uninterrupted maintenance of mindfulness and alertness. The main focus of both mindfulness and attentiveness is the examination our mind 
Abandoning the Disturbing Emotions 
 99 by our mind. The point in this context is to constantly be able to recognize the presence of defects as well as the positive qualities in our mind. The reason for doing this is not simply to benefit or protect ourselves, but to benefit others because we are following the example of bodhisattvas and we have generated bodhichitta. We are trying to put that into practice and we practice in a manner that is concordant with that motivation. So, whatever we do with our body, our speech, or our mind should be done only out of concern for others. If we can directly benefit others through body, speech, and mind then that’s wonderful; but even if we can’t, we should still have the basic intention that everything we do is done to benefit others.   37. So that the suffering of innumerable sentient beings   may be cleared away, With a superior knowledge permeated by  three-fold purity To dedicate all virtues toward enlightenment  Gained by their effort is the practice of bodhisattvas.   “Gained by their effort” is a bodhisattva’s exertion in cultivating the practice described in the previous thirty-six verses that outline the complete path of a bodhisattva, beginning with taking the refuge vow through the application of mindfulness and attentiveness.  The point here is that these thirty-seven points of practice do not come naturally to us. Without the application of mindfulness and alertness, we will not be able to do these practices because from beginningless time we have become progressively more and more accustomed to a perverted state of being where we have only thought of ourselves and have tried only to protect ourselves. Rarely have we thought about 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 100 exerting ourselves for the true benefit of others; rather we have become more and more accustomed to dwelling in the disturbing emotions and have rarely become accustomed to dwelling in states of virtue. We have not naturally stumbled and automatically embraced the practices of the six perfections and four practices taught in the sutras. In fact, these practices go against the grain of our nature because of our habituation to samsara. So, the nature of our being tends to manifest in quite negative actions because of our habits.   The only way we can turn this around these habits is through the conscious and intense application of exertion and diligence. If we engage in this intense application of diligence, we will generate extremely great virtue or as the last verse says, “So that the suffering of innumerable sentient beings may be cleared away.”  If we succeed in developing our virtuous attitude through diligence, what do we do with this virtue? The answer, of course, is to liberate and remove the suffering of all beings, which means that any virtue or any merit that we produce should always be dedicated to others. We do not dedicate this virtue on this path to ourselves by thinking, “By the power of this virtue may everything go very well for me.”   Why is it appropriate to ignore ourselves and to think of others in this manner? It is because beings in samsara are suffering so much; they are undergoing inconceivable suffering of the six realms and so forth. And the number of such beings is, as the text says is endless.  So, it is necessary to dedicate all virtue that we accumulate to others. But beyond that, this dedication needs to be pure in nature meaning so that when we make this dedication, it must be made without any clinging to our own gain. The line, “With a superior knowledge permeated by three-fold purity” means that if genuine wisdom (prajna) that recognizes the three aspects of dedication—the person 
Abandoning the Disturbing Emotions 
 101 dedicating, the person receiving the dedication, and the dedicated merit—all lack true existence, then the dedication is pure. This is necessary, so the text concludes, “To dedicate all virtue toward enlightenment gained by their effort is the practice of bodhisattvas.”

 102  Appendix D  Four Conditions for Karma to Take its Course  For one to receive the negative karma of any action, these four conditions must be met. For example, if you step on an ant by accident it does not meet condition two and therefore will not result in any negative karma. These conditions apply to all actions, not just the act of killing.  1. THE OBJECT OF THE ACTION.  In order for the act of killing to occur, there must be the actual object or being who will be killed.   2. THE INTENTION. For the act of killing to occur, a second factor must be present: the intention. One must have the motivation to harm the person.  3. THE ACTION ITSELF. In addition to having the object and the motivation, there must be a third factor of actually undertaking of the action of killing. This means that although one may have the intention of killing someone, one has to carry it out for it to be the negative karmic act of killing.  4. THE COMPLETED ACTION. Finally, the fourth factor is called “completion.” For an act to reap the negative karma of the action there has to be an actual result of the action. For an act of true killing, the being must actually die. Of course, trying to kill someone and being unsuccessful will result in negative karma of wanting to harm someone, but it won’t be as strong as the negative karma of actually killing someone.  
 
 103   Chapter 8  The Conclusion  The Seven Points of Mind Training has seven main topics and we now come the conclusion which not part of these 37 teachings (so we have labeled these verses with letters). In the conclusion Ngülchu Thogme discusses how these 37 verses are an accurate Dharma teaching of how a bodhisattva should practice.  (c) Following the meaning of the sutras, tantras,    and treatises And the teachings of genuine masters. I have given these thirty-seven verses of a   bodhisattva’s practice   For the benefit of those who wish to train    on the bodhisattva’s path.   he point of this concluding verse made by Ngülchu Thogme is that he did not make up any of these verses because it comes from a pure source. This pure source comes from two different sources: the words of the Buddha and the words of authoritative commentaries made by the great scholars and siddhas of the past.   The words of the Buddha can be divided into the sutras and the tantras. Here the sutras refer to what is called the “three baskets”: (1) the teachings given directly by the Buddha, (2) the Abhidharma teachings on developing prajna and the sutra teachings on meditation and (3) the Vinaya teachings on personal conduct. These three baskets are the main inspiration T 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 104 and source for this text, but they are not the only source because the text also draws upon the profound tantras. The reason for combining the sutra and tantra approaches is that this is the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism called “the tradition of the threefold vajraholder.” This vajraholder cultivates the practices of the three vehicles—the Foundation, the Mahayana, and the Vajrayana path simultaneously. In this text there is also material which is drawn from the four tantras―the kriya-tantras, the charya-tantras, the yoga-tantras and the anutarayoga-tantras. So, these are the types sources in the text that are included in the words of the Buddha.  Ngülchu Thogme also based this presentation on the commentaries (Skt. shastras). These commentaries serve to summarize and extend the teachings of the Buddha and to explain the path composed by great scholars and siddhas. First of all, as this text on the Thirty-seven Practices is a summary of the essential points of the sutras, tantras, and commentaries, it is without mistakes. At the same time, it is possible that the summary of these texts could have some errors in it. Generally speaking, there are many sophists who try to compose commentaries on the Buddhist teachings without having any instruction––they just read the sutras, tantras and shastras and then write a commentary. This kind of commentary then might totally misunderstand import or meaning of the teachings. However, this is not at all what Ngülchu Thogme has done. He explains this in the second line: “Following the meaning of the sutras, tantras, and treatises and the teachings of genuine masters” meaning that while he is taking the teachings of the Buddha and the commentaries upon them as his ultimate source, he has also been guided by his understanding of them by the oral instructions (Tib. monag). So Thogme use a twofold source: the original sutra source of the text themselves and the guidance of a teacher in his practice of listening, reflection, and meditating that enabled him to correctly understand and therefore to summarize the teachings correctly. 
The Conclusion 
 105  There is also the possibility that Ngülchu Thogme’s motivation could be improper but, in fact, this is not so because he composed the text not out of arrogance or out of the desire to become famous, but in order to make the teachings available to practitioners who require them. He therefore says, “I have given these thirty-seven verses of a bodhisattva’s practice for the benefit of those who wish to train on the bodhisattva’s path.” He composed this text with the pure intention that those who wish to practice the Mahayana, but do not have the information and instruction they needed available to them. He also composed this treatise to encourage those who do not dare to practice the Mahayana out of fear of being too difficult to pursue.  In the next verse Ngülchu Thogme claims to have no personal qualities of any kind. He makes this claim as a demonstration of humility.   (d) Since my intelligence is low and little trained, The art of this text will not delight scholars. Yet since they’re based on the sutras and teachings    of genuine masters, I believe these practices of a bodhisattva to be    free of confusion.  Thogme is saying is that he has neither innate nor acquired wisdom (prajna). There are some people who have innate prajna such that even with relatively little or no study they can easily understand the meaning of the sutras and tantras and even compose correct explanations of them. Thogme says he is not one of those individuals. There are also those who have no natural, great prajna but through great diligence—diligence like what would be inspired by one’s head catching fire—in studying and developing that prajna through their study that they can then explain sutras and tantras to others. So Thogme explains there are some people who have innate prajna and 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 106 some people who have acquired prajna and some people who have both but he has none of the above.  In the first line he demonstrates this lack of arrogance and in the second line he goes on to say, “The art of this text will not delight scholars” meaning that his text has the defect of lacking elegance in composition. However, with this statement he goes on to point out that in spite of all this, the text is unmistaken and without deception. His reason is that “since they’re based on the sutras and teachings of genuine masters, I believe these practices of a bodhisattva to be free of confusion.”  This is to say that since this text is based on his earnest listening, contemplation, and meditation upon these authentic teachings of the Buddha under the guidance of his teachers, then there should be no bad result from studying it. Studying this text, reflecting upon it, meditating upon it, and teaching it to others will cause neither oneself nor anyone else any confusion.  In fact, Ngülchu Thogme was an incredible person who embodied the qualities of learning, of impeccable conduct, and excellence in attainment, so what he says about himself here is simply not true. This is said as a demonstration of humility because that is appropriate. On the other hand, if I (Thrangu Rinpoche) were to say such things about myself, they would be literally true. It is important for me to tell you that I don’t have the power or ability to lead you out of samsara or even to give you instructions. This is because all I have done here is repeat as clearly and literally as possible the words and intentions of Ngülchu Thogme in the case of this text, I think that what I have taught you is without deception and can be relied upon both for your study and for your practice. So, I think you can trust what I have said and what you read in this text.   The last verse in the concluding section of this text is a request for patience.     
The Conclusion 
 107 (e) Since an inferior intellect such as mine has    difficulty fathoming The great waves of a bodhisattva’s activity,  I pray that genuine masters will be patient  With all the defects here―contradictions, irrelevancies,    and so on.  While this text is trustworthy, at the same time the practice of a bodhisattva is inconceivably vast in scope and profound in import. This is not because its true meaning can only be realized by a superior bodhisattva who has gone through many in-numerable eons gathering the accumulations. These practices cannot be easily grasped by a beginner. Therefore, Thogme is saying that it is difficult to fathom for one with small intelligence like himself. Because he is again portraying himself as someone with small intelligence, he says that there might be contradictions and a certain amount of incoherence in the text and if so, he requests the patience of the bodhisattvas with his frailties. Clearly, this verse is also a demonstration of the relinquishing arrogance.  When we practice Dharma, a variety of different thoughts and attitudes can arise in our mind. Sometimes when we begin to experience the vastness and profundity of genuine Dharma, we might start to think, “Well, someone like me can never really understand this. And even if I understand it, I certainly can’t practice it. And even if I could practice it, it is certainly not going to work” and we become discouraged. However, being discouraged is inappropriate here because each and every one of us possesses the eighteen conditions that make up a truly precious human existence––conditions which are explained in the preliminaries and Appendix A (Page 40). This means that each and every one of us is fully worthy of all the Dharma there is.  We should also think that the Buddhist Dharma has not disappeared; it is still around in a complete and authentic form. When we consider the attainments of Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 108 Milarepa and so forth, did they attain siddhi? How did they attain enlightenment or awakening? Did they all undergo practicing, received instructions that no longer exist or are no longer appropriate? No. The instructions that we can receive and the practices that we can engage in nowadays are exactly the same practices that were done in the old days. If we faithfully follow these practices, there is absolutely no doubt that we will achieve the same results. So, we should not be discouraged and if we reflect upon these circumstances we should develop great courage.   We might think that, “The great scholars and mahasiddhas of the past practiced with incredible diligence. Look at the example of Milarepa who attained siddhis through inconceivable diligence in complete austerity. We may think, “I simply can’t do that, so obviously I am just wasting my life.” But we should not get depressed and to think this way. Merely coming into contact with Dharma, merely entering the door of Dharma, makes us extremely fortunate and makes us worthy of the situation itself. Any little bit of practice we do has a tremendous benefit. The Buddha said that the amount of benefit of someone having one thought of faith in the Dharma and as a consequence joining his palms in a gesture of respect for even an instant is something that is inconceivable and inexpressible. Even if someone had little confidence in Dharma, thinking, “Well, Dharma is probably pretty good” and puts one palm up in a gesture of half-hearted respect, the benefit of this would be inconceivable and definite. We can understand this if we carefully think about it, not just relying upon it because it was said by the Buddha. If we think about how our mind works, our confidence in Dharma and how the process of entering the path gradually grows. Later, the habit of this confidence will increase more and more in our mind. Finally, this habit will most definitely produce the ultimate fruition (enlightenment). So sooner or later we will all attain this ultimate fruition and there is no doubt about it. That being the case, we should never 
The Conclusion 
 109 put ourselves down because we don’t practice the way we think we should or the amount we think we should.   At the same time, a very different defect can also arise in our practice which is thinking, “Well, I have studied Dharma carefully and I have practiced Dharma a great deal. I am really great.” It is very good, of course, to study and practice, but if it produces arrogance, this becomes an important problem because arrogance itself which could prevent us from achieving any result. It is said that arrogance is like an iron-ball which nothing can penetrate—that no matter how much water you pour on an iron-ball, the water will not stay there but will flow right off. While it is true that there will be some positive result of practice, it is necessary to remember this notion presented so clearly in this text of cutting through arrogance and staying humble and especially to never becoming content with how much we know and how much we have practiced. We should never relax our diligence until we have actually achieved full Buddhahood.   Sometimes we think, “Well, I have been practicing for so many years and have achieved no confirmation the practice has been effective, let alone realization,” or “I have been studying for so many years and still don’t know anything.” At that point, we usually start thinking, “Well, it’s not me. There is something wrong with Dharma. These practices don’t work anymore.”   In fact, the defect in this case is not in the Dharma but something in our practice. We can see this—it’s not a matter of simple-minded faith for the fact that so many great scholars and siddhas have arisen in the more than 2500 years since the Buddha passed away. What is wrong is that we mistake the nature of practice itself or we fail to create a genuine motivation or we simply aren’t diligent enough or we have become too arrogant. When something goes wrong with our practice and this impedes the result, it is important to always look at what we are really doing, at what is really going on with us, and not to immediately ascribe all problems and defects to something 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 110 wrong with Dharma or to something wrong with somebody else.   This is described in this last verse: “I pray that genuine masters will be patient with all the defects here―contra-dictions, irrelevancies, and all the others.” Therefore, it is the practice of bodhisattvas to constantly look at their own confusion. We have to actually do this consciously by actually asking, “What am I doing right? What am I doing wrong?” We must constantly question our own actions and attitudes. Defects will arise from time to time, but they can always be corrected if we are willing to do so. And it is possible that we may discover that we possess no positive qualities, but remember we certainly possess buddha nature. Having buddha nature means that we can develop qualities even if we don’t possess them when we look for them. Again, we should not become discouraged or depressed about it.  Sometimes we develop doubt about our practice by thinking, “Well, I am not getting much out of this or I am probably visualizing incorrectly or pronouncing the mantra wrong.” or “I guess I am not performing the mudras properly.” Such mistakes are definitely not important problems because they do not impede our realization. What impedes our realization is a lack of genuine motivation, a lack of diligence, and a lack of confidence in Dharma. Basically, most of all when we falter, we lack courage. If we can practice with this, there will definitely be the fruition of our practice.  THE DEDICATION  (f) Through the virtue arising from these verses,  May all beings become like the protector Chenrezig,  Who, out of supreme relative and absolute bodhichitta,  Remains in neither the extreme of samsaric existence   nor nirvanic peace.  
The Conclusion 
 111 Generally speaking, Buddhist texts always end with this request for patience and finally the dedication of merit. The real intention of these concluding sections of any text is to serve as instruction to those studying the text by encouraging them to first of all relinquish arrogance and secondly to remind the practitioners that all the virtue that they accumulate through practice and reading should be sealed by this dedication of the merit to others. Sometimes people fear that if they dedicate all their merit or virtue to others, they will lose it. Or they may have the belief that if they dedicate the merit and virtue to others, these others will actually receive it as though it were poured into them. In fact, neither of these is possible.   The real function of the dedication of merit is to train our mind to gradually develop the courage to be able to work solely for the benefit of others. The dedication of merit also benefits others in the long-term in the sense that as our attitude and courage grows and changes, we will start to accumulate more and more virtue which makes us to become naturally more and more directed towards the benefit of others. So, in that sense, we become a great benefit to others through having trained our mind in the dedication of merit.    The main aspiration of this verse is that all beings become equal to the practice of Chenrezig. What does become “like Chenrezig” mean here? It means equal in his compassion. Through his compassion, Chenrezig does not abide in the extreme of peaceful, solitary nirvana and he does not through his compassion abide in the state of samsaric confusion. Because of his prajna and compassion, he transcends both possible extremes. By transcending all extremes, he is the embodiment of the activity of all buddhas. This is brought about by prajna which transcends the extreme of existence and is produced by the cultivation of absolute bodhichitta and the compassion which transcends the extreme of peace and is brought about by the cultivation of relative bodhichitta. So, we aspire to this by saying, “I dedicate all this merit so that all beings may develop relative and absolute bodhichitta and then 
The Thirty-seven Practices of a Bodhisattva 
 112 ultimately attain supreme omniscience and awakening which transcends the two extremes.”  THE COLOPHON  The text ends with the colophon which reads,   For the benefit of self and other, the monk Ngülchu Thogme, who elucidates the scriptures and their logic, composed these verses at the Precious Cave of Mercury.  There is no profound meaning in this—it is simply saying that he wrote it.  Questions  Question: Rinpoche, in discussing how generosity and discipline come together, there seems to be quite a subtle distinction in some cases of taking a nihilistic point of view, saying that it is proper to give such objects that others become attached to and so forth. I wonder if you could talk a little about this subtle understanding? Rinpoche: In any situation of generosity it is possible that it can increase the recipient’s mental ignorance when we give what people really need and what they don’t need. For example, if someone who is impoverished and starving is given food, it will benefit them and if someone who is very sick is given medicine, they will benefit from it. If someone is given an education and they make use of this education it will benefit them. And these are situations in which acts of generosity can be of direct and great benefit. Sometimes it is not like that. Sometimes people ask for things they don’t really need and can’t use or are harmful. In these cases, we don’t benefit the person. We can find a more precise distinction what is useful and what is not useful in The Jewel Ornament of Liberation by Gampopa. 
The Conclusion 
 113 Question: Rinpoche, we don’t usually think of joy associated with effort, with discipline, and with patience. I heard you say that when we practice the paramitas properly, then it will be joyful. I was wondered if you could say more? Rinpoche: Generally speaking, there are different types of approaches taken in different texts that reflect the teaching style of the writer. Some people compose and teach from the point of view of expressing their delight in Dharma and others do it through expressing a kind of sadness that is of the nature of mindfulness, alertness, and circumspection. Basically, Thogme who composed this text, taught from a viewpoint of sadness or disgust with samsara. In fact, in his biography there is the story that one of his students went to him one day and said, “Sir, when we listen to you, we all get very depressed. And you seem to be quite sad yourself when you are teaching. But when I look over at Buton Rinpoche (a famous contemporary of Thogme), they seem to be having a good time. When Buton teaches, he is laughing and all the students are laughing and everyone is happy. Over here, when you teach and we listen, you are crying, we are crying—it is very depressing.” So, it’s really a question of emphasis or personal style.   
 
 114 Appendix F  An Example of the 12 Links of  Interdependent Origination  1. IGNORANCE. Someone kills because of ignorance, not realizing what a bad thing it is nor the karmic results that will come from doing it. Generally, ignorance is the very nature of the action and its consequences and sets the beginning for other links to happen.  2. KARMIC CREATION. If someone kills a person because of ignorance, then the actual act of killing is the second link, karmic creation. That act does not take place all by itself. Various secondary factors accompany it.  3. CONSCIOUSNESS. The third link is the stream of consciousness of the killer at the time, i.e., the motivation for killing, the strength of feeling, the vision of the whole act, and how his consciousness is imprinted by the act.  4. NAME AND FORM. The consciousness and the act of killing are accompanied by the fourth link, so the five aggregates of form, feeling, cognition, mental events, and consciousness take part in the action.  5. SIX PERCEPTUAL ENTRANCES. The six perceptual entrances also play their part, because during the act of killing there is seeing, hearing, and the three other sensory con-sciousnesses.  6. CONTACT. In this particular example, the contact takes place when the person is struck with the weapon and the deed is done.  7. FEELING. The seventh link is the feeling in the mind of the actor (the killer) at that time; whether he or she feels great suffering or pleasure in doing the act.  8. GRASPING OR INVOLVEMENT. This link is the particular feeling of satisfaction or aversion that comes from carrying out the action.  9. ADOPTION. The killer does not stop half-way through but continues to carry the act out to the end.  
The Conclusion 
 115 10. BECOMING. The tenth link covers the whole action, i.e., once the action is being done, then the killer has created the karma which will produce a result in the future.  11. BIRTH. Birth applies to that particular life and the consequences to the killer in the future.  12. AGING AND DEATH. Aging and death apply to both the end of that life and also to the end of the particular action.
