 1  Editor’s Foreword  Two and a half millennia ago the Buddha proposed that all our happiness and all of our suffering is due to one thing: our mind. The Buddha after reaching enlightenment spent the rest of his life giving teachings on how we can work with our mind to achieve the complete peace and freedom of enlightenment.  The basic method for working with mind is through meditation. The Buddha began by teaching sitting meditation which is practiced by Buddhists all over the world. This path, called the sutra path, is a very steady and gradual path. Except in the case of a few exceptional individuals, it takes many lifetimes of Buddhist practice to achieve enlightenment utilizing the sutra path. To progress, regardless of sect or style, we should begin by practicing the accumulation of great merit, developing pure conduct, and engaging in Shamatha and Vipashyana meditation.  Another path leading to enlightenment is the Vajrayana path. If we apply ourselves with great effort to Vajrayana practice, it is possible to achieve enlightenment much more rapidly. Thrangu Rinpoche has pointed out many times that the goal of awakening or enlightenment is exactly the same for all paths. The choice is in the method we select to pursue on the path. Both of these two sutra and Vajrayana methods have been extensively practiced in Tibet. The most important Vajrayana meditation is the meditation of the Mahamudra or “great seal” which involves looking directly at the mind. To understand this Mahamudra meditation, we examine the nature of mind, how thoughts arise, where they dwell, and where they disappear to. Understanding this leads to profound insights on the path.  This text on the difference between consciousness and wisdom is a detailed map of what we learn when we begin to examine the mind. Rangjung Dorje, the Third Karmapa, begins this text with a description of the eight consciousnesses and details each in terms of what it does and how it leads us to 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 2 perceive our world. Because of our eight consciousnesses, we actually see the world in a deluded way. This leads us to  experience samsara causing the continual experience of unhappiness, frustration, dissatisfaction, and emotional up-heavals.  In this text, Rangjung Dorje, one of the great Buddhist thinkers of his time, brings together the Abhidharma literature of the Foundation Vehicle, the emptiness teachings of the Middle Way, the Mind Only teachings of the Mahayana vehicle, and the practice of examining the mind directly through the Mahamudra practice of the Vajrayana vehicle. After his description of how the eight consciousnesses function, he explains how these are transformed into the five wisdoms of a buddha that manifest when we have attain enlightenment.  The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom is not like most Buddhist texts in that it is not in the form of a scholarly thesis, but in the form of a song of realization (Tib. gur), often called a doha. A spiritual song distills the realization of the practitioner in verse, and is sung with a melody. It is also like poetry in that each line has a certain number of syllables. This particular text is very compact and comprises only 36 verses. In the nineteenth century the great scholar, Jamgon Kongtrul, wrote a longer commentary on this treatise to help clarify its meaning. Thrangu Rinpoche consulted Jamgon Kongtrul’s commentary, An Adornment for Rangjung Dorje’s Thoughts, when he taught Rangjung Dorje’s  spiritual song.   In the Tibetan tradition, students first memorize the root verses as a part of their religious studies. The students then request a lama, known not only for his or her scholarly accomplishment and understanding of the text, but also for the lama’s realization, to give a lengthy line-by-line commentary on the root text. Presented in this book is a translation of this great vajra song and a commentary by Thrangu Rinpoche, an eminent scholar of Buddhism who possesses the above qualities. With this text the Western student of Buddhism can have the experience of being able to study a profound text with a 
Editor’s Foreword 
 3 commentary by an excellent scholar just as students in the Buddhist monasteries of Tibet have done for the past millen-nium.  To understand Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom we need to understand that the Buddhist view of reality is quite different from the one taught in our schools and universities. Modern science and engineering has given the world some amazing and useful things such as cars and airplanes and cell phones which have allowed great spiritual teachers to expand their teaching beyond their monasteries all over the world. But with each advancement also comes some negative con-sequences. Cell phones have also distracted the minds of vast numbers of people away from who they are and has fueled an insatiable desire for materialism. The Seventeen Karmapa once said, “If Milarepa had had a cell phone, it would of taken him many more years to reach enlightenment.”  However, the Buddha taught everything is insubstantial or empty of inherent nature. The Buddha said that our world is like a dream, a mirage, an illusion. Several centuries later the great Buddhist practitioner Nagarjuna using logical arguments demonstrated that external phenomena that we usually consider solid and real and outside of ourselves is actually not that at all but rather is “empty” or insubstantial. This concept of emptiness is central to all discussions on the nature of reality in the Mahayana and Vajrayana levels of Buddhism is. Emptiness (Skt. shunyata) is actually the fundamental characteristic of all external and internal phenomena.  In Thrangu Rinpoche’s commentary and in his other teachings he gives a detailed description of how Nagarjuna came up with describing the true nature of reality as being empty. We might think the idea that everything is empty and a mental construct is crazy but for the fact that physicists in the twentieth century have come up with a similar conclusion. To give a present example of emptiness, we are told in modern physics that solid objects around us are not made up of solid particles, but are actually made up of patterns of energy. The physicist 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 4 David Bohm poetically said, “matter is crystallized light.” It has also been well demonstrated that solid objects are made of atoms and are actually 99.99% “empty” space. For example, if we were to enlarge atoms in a table to the size of a marble, these atoms would be separated by miles of empty space between them. This fact might explain miracles where highly realized persons, such as the Karmapa, have put their hand through solid objects without a problem. One example of attempts to unite conscious-ness with western science was Goswami in his The Self-aware Universe in which he reviews western philosophical and science attempts to explain mind and thinking as being part of the physical body and then suggests that only quantum physics can properly explain body and mind.  Besides understanding the emptiness of phenomena, we should understand the two types of reality proposed in Buddhism. Be aware that emptiness or the insubstantiality of all external sights, sounds, bodily sensations and also internal thoughts and feelings is treated slightly differently in two different schools in Tibet. To greatly simplify, the Shentong tradition holds that on the relative level of reality, phenomena are indeed “empty” but there is an additional quality of this emptiness on the ultimate level of reality which is that buddha nature pervades all sentient beings. Buddha nature is the potential possessed by all sentient beings that allows them to reach Buddhahood. The other school, Rangtong tradition, holds that everything is empty of inherent existence and so buddha nature cannot exist in everyone as a permanent quality. These differing views of the Shentong and Rangtong are given in much more detail in Thrangu Rinpoche’s Shentong and Rangtong: Two Views of Emptiness.   This Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom by Rangjung Dorje is an important text of the Shentong view, a view held mainly by the Kagyu, Nyingma, and Jonang schools in Tibet. We need to also keep in mind that the Shentong view is not interpreted always exactly the same way and that 
Editor’s Foreword 
 5 Rangjung Dorje himself held slightly different views about the mind from the traditional Mind Only school.   An important addition to the traditional Buddhist teachings on emptiness is that Rangjung Dorje in this text describes exactly  how the eight consciousnesses are transformed into the five wisdoms which he based on his own realization. To make sure this part of the book was properly represented, Thrangu Rinpoche himself reviewed this portion of the Transformation of Consciousness into Wisdom to make sure the text conformed exactly to what Rangjung Dorje had proposed.  Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom is also an im-portant text on Buddhist psychology as well as Buddhist philosophy. Rangjung Dorje in this text, arrives at conclusions about how the mind works which are far different from what modern Western psychology would suggest. To illustrate this, I will briefly summarize the arguments of the text, by contrasting them to a Western psychology framework.    Over half of the world’s population and almost all Buddhists believe that reincarnation is a real phenomena. Modern psychol-ogy, for the most part, dismisses this idea of reincarnation likely because of a fear of offending theistic religions and an institutional bias since reincarnation has not been “scientifically proven.” Actually, the scientific proof that reincarnation is real is much more easily proven than the existence of dark matter or the search for the imaginary “god particle” (and would cost billions less). But science, being essentially the new religion, has not pursued the investigation of reincarnation since they have not been able to fit human consciousness into the complex equations of theoretical mathematics.  If reincarnation is ever proven real (as almost all Buddhists from the time of the Buddha believe), it will make a profound change in western psychological thought. Western psychology posits that a child is born with a mind that is basically blank which develops based on physical factors such as DNA and a person’s mind then is simply what develops from the person’s experience in his or her environment.  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 6  Basically psychology cannot explain how a child can easily learn multiple languages in their first four years. They also cannot explain how a child, just learning to talk, will recognize and generalize huge amounts of sensory information. For example, a child can be shown a regular chair and after being told it is a “chair,” will see an aluminum frame with plastic weaving in the back yard and call it a “chair.” A large rock on the side of a trail is also a “chair” and a beautiful gold and jeweled throne is a “chair.” The Buddhist answer to these questions is that individuals have reincarnated for thousands of lifetimes. In each of these lives they have had extensive experience with material objects. These experiences have been stored in their mind (in the eighth consciousness). So recognizing objects and language patterns is easy and requires only that the environment provide clues before it is remembered.  Who better to make the argument for reincarnation than the author of this treatise, the Karmapa? For the past sixteen lifetimes the Karmapa has written a letter a few years before his death. In this letter, which is not opened until several years after his death, he gives his future name, the name of his subsequent parents, and where they can find his ensuing reincarnation. This letter has always been accurate demonstrating that comprehending reincarnation is far beyond our understanding.   Now I would like to briefly go through the steps in Discriminating Consciousness from Wisdom because it lays out the basic concepts of Buddhist thought in a very concise way.   First, this spontaneous song of realization begins with a refutation of the non-Buddhist philosophies that existed at the time. When comparing the teachings of the Buddha with other religions, both then and even now, the major difference is that Buddhism does not believe in a god or higher power that created the world and should be worshiped.   Second, Rangjung Dorje takes the Middle Way approach that external phenomena which includes not only objects such as mountains, houses, people, but it also includes all the sounds, tastes, smells, bodily sensations that we have. Many Eastern and 
Editor’s Foreword 
 7 Western philosophies and science at the time of the Buddha up to the present have explained that external phenomena are solid and real because it can be measured and is made from atoms. Since the time of the Buddha, there has been a large portion of Buddhism which has reject this with the Mahayana and Vajra-yana belief that external phenomena is rather an illusion and is actually insubstantial or “empty.”  Third, the alaya consciousness, first described in the fourth century by the Mind Only school of Buddhism, stores all our impressions and karmic seeds or karmic latencies1 and this makes it possible for us to function. If we look at a piece of metal that is of gold and depicts a man seated cross-legged touching the ground, we immediately think, “a statue of the Buddha.” But how did we know it was the Buddha or even who the Buddha was? We somewhere in our mind must have stored some previous experience where someone had told us who the Buddha was. This then is one function of the alaya consciousness. Penfield, a Canadian neurologist working with epileptics has presented evidence that persons store every sensory impression we experience in the brain. Rangjung Dorje citing the Mind Only school goes much further than this and says that the alaya consciousness stores impressions over many lifetimes which obviously places the alaya consciousness outside of physical the brain.   Fourth, the alaya consciousness has been treated by all meditators as being empty of nature. We feel that we possess a solid and real mind but this mind is merely a continuity of an ever-changing stream. This means the mind for Buddhists is not a permanent self or atman in the Hindu sense or a soul in the Christian sense. This consciousness does not only store these  1. Karmic latencies (Tib. pakchak) can be positive or negative and they are latencies that come through the seventh consciousness and enter the eighth consciousness. These imprints are not apparently the ex-perience itself, but more like seeds which sprout when the right conditions arise. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 8 impressions from many lifetimes, but it also stores the karmic latencies of these experiences. This fact is very important for meditators because if the eighth consciousness didn’t store these latencies, there would be no cause and effect of our actions, and essentially we could do anything we wanted to do with no fear of consequences (except for what the authorities found out). However, there is karma so Buddhists on the path must engage with great diligence to have only positive impressions and latencies enter their alaya consciousness.   When we meet the Dalai Lama or some other realized person, we can feel the goodness and compassion radiating from them. This is not because they have been doing some special practice, but rather that they have been diligently working with their mind to accumulate positive karma.  Fifth, these latencies or impression leave the alaya conscious-ness in two ways. First, when we dream these karmic latencies appear to the mental consciousness and the mental conscious-ness takes them to be real phenomena so our dreams seem so real. Second, when sense impressions from our sense faculties reach the mental consciousness, the mental consciousness combines these with the latencies from the alaya consciousness this sensory information appears real and solid to us, although outer phenomena is actually not solid and real. It is this process of mind that leads great Buddhist meditators to tell us that our experience of external phenomena is created by mind and that our world is actually an illusion.  Sixth, with great diligence of having only positive im-pressions and latencies enter the alaya consciousness and with strong meditation, we can actually purify the alaya conscious-ness to the point that our ordinary consciousnesses transform into the five wisdoms of enlightenment. Then we are no longer bound by our material circumstance and have actually trans-cended samsaric entrapment. At this point a great meditation master such as Milarepa can put his hand through solid objects because he has completely realized that they are, in fact, empty. 
Editor’s Foreword 
 9 It is only our latent impressions over hundreds of lifetimes that have made external phenomena solid and “real” for us.  We now have the joining of several strands of Buddhist philosophy: there is no creator that we have to rely on to reach enlightenment; we experience external objects on the relative level of reality as being empty as expounded by the Middle Way school; our mind has luminous clarity so this emptiness is not a complete voidness as expounded by the Shentong school; we have the Mind Only view that everything is mind and that the eighth consciousness has accumulated karmic latencies from beginningless time. So over beginningless time the eighth consciousness has received latencies that these empty external objects are solid and real and therefore when we perceive an object these latencies make us believe that all external phenomena is solid and real, rather than empty.2    Clearly, this summary is a cursory account of Buddhist psychology. It is difficult to reconcile Eastern and Western psychology because these two psychologies rely on entirely different assumptions. These differences also show how modern and relevant Rangjung Dorje’s text is even though it was written seven hundred years ago.   Thrangu Rinpoche’s commentary on this text was given on two different occasions: at the Namo Buddha Summer Seminar in Oxford, England, in September 1989 and at the Namo Buddha Winter Seminar in January of 1990 in Nepal. The presentation here is the combined teachings since in one teaching he would  2. This has been expressed in the third turning of wheel of Dharma Lankavatara sutra with:  The perception of external phenomena as reality  Is caused by diverse thoughts  Rooted in the psychic residue of past lives.  This is the transitory mind.  It creates all forms.  What appears to be external reality  Is actually nonexistent.

 10 elaborate on a certain topic and in the other teaching elaborate on another topic.  This third edition of Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom has changed some of the terminology to make it more readable. It also has added a new chapter by Thrangu Rinpoche on the five buddha families to expand on the five wisdoms. This edition has also added some new charts to clarify important concepts of Thrangu Rinpoche’s commentary.    In the first edition of this book, the idea of a solid and real matter has become even more tenuous with the discovery of “dark” matter that makes up a large part of the universe and which is not well unexplained by modern science. There is also no real explanation for the possibility of there are perhaps eleven parallel universes. Finally, the problem mentioned about of how a child can so readily recognize objects and learn speech so quickly and effortlessly has not been solved by western psychology. What has been hopeful is that there has been a slowly developing field of documenting research on  reincarna-tion.         ––Clark Johnson, Ph. D.   
 11 Translator’s Preface  Prior to the time of the Buddha (c. 490-410 BCE) the Brahmanas and the earliest Upanishads of the Vedic tradition in India presented enumerations of the constituents that comprised an individual’s mind and faculties. For instance eight pranas were described in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishads as the prana of breath, eye, speech, tongue, ear, body, mind (manas), all of which arose from and were reabsorbed into  an underlying atman (soul or self).  The Buddha, who referred to and refuted the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, denied the existence of the underlying atman, but enumerated the constituents of the empirical individual in his doctrines of the five aggregates (skandhas), and of the six conscious-nesses.   All the early Buddhist traditions that developed from the third century BCE onwards, preserved the teaching of six conscious-nesses. In particular, a systematizing doctrine based on the Buddha’s sutras attempted to present a numeric delineation of the constituents of existence. This was known as the Abhidharma tradition to such an extent that the Vaisheshika considered certain Abhidharma texts to be the words of the Buddha. The Tripitaka or “Three Baskets” were formed through joining the Abhidharma to the collection of the sutras together with the Vinaya, the Buddha’s teachings on monastic rules. Other philosophical schools, such as the Sautrantika, however, refused to recognize the canonical authenticity of the Abhi-dharma, which was given only commentarial status.  All Tibetan Buddhist traditions recognize the supremacy of the Sautrantika amongst the early schools of Buddhism. There-fore, there is no Abhidharma section in the Kangyur, the Tibetan canon of the Buddha’s words. All Abhidharma texts are found only in the Tengyur––the Tibetan translations of Indian Buddhist treatises and commentaries. The principal treatise in this canon is the Treasury of the Abhidharma (Abhidharma-kosha) by Vasubandhu (fourth to fifth centuries CE). 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 12  The Madhyamaka (Middle Way) tradition which was promul-gated especially by Nagarjuna (second century CE) also taught the six consciousnesses. Later Madhyamaka masters such as Chandrakirti (seventh century) and Shantideva (675-715 CE), (who are referred to by Thrangu Rinpoche in this book), maintained this view. They denied the validity of the two additional consciousnesses introduced by the Chittamatra (Mind Only) school which were promulgated especially by Asanga (fourth century) and his younger brother Vasubandhu in his later Mahayana works, such as The Thirty Verses; a key source for Rangjung Dorje’s The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness and Wisdom.  The eighth century witnessed the rise of a syncretism of Madhyamaka and Chittamatra such as that taught by Shantarakshita. Shantarakshita came to Tibet 762 CE and was instrumental in establishing Buddhism there. As a result of this unification of differing views, scholars began to divide the Buddha’s teachings into those in which the meaning is explicit, and those in which the meaning is implicit. In the latter category the apparent meaning was, therefore, considered to be expedient. This new method of classification allowed scholars to consider the body of the Buddha’s teachings as a unified hierarchy of what were otherwise regarded as contradictory views.  In addition, by the mid-eighth century, the tantra was well established. This introduced a system of the five dhyana buddhas with corresponding sets of elements, afflictions, and wisdoms. The numerical equivalence with the five aggregates facilitated a teaching of the transmutation of specific skandhas to corresponding wisdoms. This teaching is found, for example, in the eleventh century terma, the Bardo Thodol, better known as The Tibetan Book of the Dead. In this system all eight conscious-nesses are included within the aggregate of consciousness, and so all eight transform into dharmadhatu wisdom. In turn each of the other aggregates transforms as follows: form transforms into mirror-wisdom, the aggregate of the sensation into equality wisdom, and the aggregate of identification into discriminating 
Translator’s Preface 
 13 wisdom, and the aggregate of mental activity into accomplish-ment wisdom. Rangjung Dorje’s text, however, presents a less-well known alternative.   Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339) was the third in the lineage of Karmapa reincarnations, the supreme hierarchs of the Karma Kagyu schools, that commenced with Dusum Khyenpa (1110-1193). He composed The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness and Wisdom in 1323 CE based particularly on the writings of the founders of the Chittamatra school, Asanga and Vasubandhu.  The commentator to this text, Jamgon Kongtrul (1813-1899), was a prolific commentator, compiler, and editor of Buddhist teachings especially of the Karma Kagyu tradition. He wrote commentaries for all three of Rangjung Dorje’s texts: The Profound Inner Meaning, On Buddha Essence and this work The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom. Jamgon Kongtrul’s commentary on the latter text is entitled An Adorn-ment for Rangjung Dorje’s Thoughts. It is this commentary which served as the basis for Thrangu Rinpoche’s teaching on the Third Karmapa’s text.  In 1959, in order to escape the Chinese Communist takeover of Tibet, the eighth Thrangu Rinpoche (born in 1933) had to leave Thrangu Monastery in east Tibet. He fled to Sikkim and later became abbot and principal scholar at Rumtek monastery in Sikkim where Rangjung Dorje, the Sixteenth Karmapa (1924-1981), had established his seat in exile. Subsequently, Thrangu Rinpoche founded Thrangu monastery and also the Namo Buddha retreat center in Nepal. Since 1979 he has toured the world extensively establishing Buddhist centers and most recently consecrated Vajra Vidya Institute which will become a center for teaching Buddhism at the deer park where the Shakyamuni Buddha give his first teaching in Sarnath.        –– Peter A.

  Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339)  Each of the Seventeen Karmapa’s have engaged in different activities. Rangjung Dorje held both the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages. He wrote many influential works on Mahamudra, Chod practice, the yogic practices, buddha nature, and on the Shentong view of Emptiness. Thrangu Rinpoche has commentaries on many of these works.  

 15  1  An Introduction to the Text  There are four major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism: the Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma, and Gelug. Each school has its own particular approach. The Gelug school, for example, emphasizes learning and scholarship, whereas the Kagyu school emphasizes practice and is therefore known, as the “practice lineage” school. The principle meditation of the Kagyu lineage is the Mahamudra3 or “Great Seal.” The Mahamudra instructions came from Saraha (ninth to tenth century CE), Tilopa (928-1009 CE), and Naropa (956-1040). They taught this method using spiritual songs or dohas. These spiritual songs do not give a detailed presentation of Buddhism but use poetical imagery to introduce the listener to the nature of the mind. These spiritual songs express these practice instructions in the form of poetry.4 They are very brief and direct and very beneficial to the mind. Although they contain actual Buddhist philosophical teachings, their emphasis is on the recognition of the nature of the mind.   Gampopa (1079-1153), the Tibetan master who founded the monastic order of the Kagyu school, unified the teachings of the Mahamudra tradition with the scholastic and monastic traditions of the  Kadam tradition of Atisha (982-1055). Gampopa taught that the study of Maitreya’s Sublime Continuum (the  3. Mahamudra is the principle meditation of the Kagyu Lineage. Much like Dzogchen of the Nyingma lineage, it does not involve special implements or liturgies and basically is a set of practices to ex-amine the nature of the mind “on the cushion” and “off the cushion.” 4. These songs (Tib. gur), often called dohas, are spontaneously sung with a melody and are based on the realization of the lama’s practice. They do not rhyme but have lines that have an exact number of Tibetan syllables (usually 7 or 9).  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 16 Uttaratantra) would be a great help for under-standing the Mahamudra instructions on the direct experience of the nature of mind.  Gampopa’s principal pupil, Dusum Khyenpa (1110-1193), was the First Karmapa and founder of the Karma Kagyu school, which has since been governed by successive Karmapa rebirths. The Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339), composed a text entitled The Profound Inner Meaning. In it he described the subtle channels and subtle winds that exist within the body and how these winds and channels are the basis for the practice of meditation.5 He also composed two other very short texts: The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness and Wisdom, which is the text we are concerned with here and a summary of the Uttaratantra entitled A Treatise Elucidating Buddha Nature. Rangjung Dorje said that if we can understand the Uttaratantra with these two short texts, we will be able to comprehend Mahamudra meditation.   THE EIGHT CONSCIOUSNESSES: AN OVERVIEW  The treatise Distinguishing Consciousness and Wisdom assumes that we have familiarity with the doctrine of the eight conscious-nesses. Therefore, before explaining the treatise itself, I shall give a brief description of the eight consciousnesses.  The first teachings given by the Buddha were those of the Foundation Vehicle now practiced primarily by Theravadin Buddhists. These teachings enumerate six different kinds of consciousness. First, where are five consciousnesses associated with the five sensory organs: the visual consciousness of the eye, the auditory consciousness of the ear, the olfactory conscious- 5. These are subtle channels (Skt. nadi, Tib. tsa) which are not anato-mical, but more like meridians. Subtle energies (Skt. prana, Tib. lung) closely related to thought flow through these channels so the practitioner can do certain yoga exercises and visualizations that greatly enhance meditation.  
An Introduction to the Text 
 17 ness of the nose, the gustatory consciousness of the tongue, and the tactile consciousness of the body. These five sensory consciousnesses directly perceive the external visual images, sounds, smells, tastes, and body sensations without making any conceptual decision about these phenomena as being good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, and so on. They are called the nonconceptual consciousnesses of direct perception.  The sixth consciousness is the mental consciousness which receives the information from the five sensory consciousnesses. In the Buddhist science of epistemology and logic, called the Pramana, the mental consciousness is defined as a conceptual consciousness. It is the mental consciousness that adds all this sensory information together and recognizes outside objects and makes decisions about them. For example, it takes external visual information from the visual consciousness and adds the auditory consciousness sounds and recognizes that it is a bird singing in a tree and may even recognize it as a bluebird. So first, an object is perceived by the eye and apprehended by the visual consciousness. This then passes on a processed image to the mental consciousness, which then conceptualizes, “this is good,” or “this is big.” This categorization goes on, of course, for perceptions of the other four sensory consciousnesses.  The mental consciousness does not have the ability of direct perception. So, for example, if we see a ball, the visual consciousness produces a visual image of the ball but doesn’t apprehend the name “ball” or its characteristics. The mental consciousness, however, apprehends a mental image of the ball, not as a visual image, but instead rely on the concept of “ball” and its specific characteristics. For example, the visual consciousness can see only one side of a door. The mental con-sciousness, however, can join many instances of perceiving the door and thus can conceive a mental image of the front and back of the door and may even make an image of what is on the other side of the door.  The five sensory consciousnesses are like a mute person who can see. Although a mute person can see everything, they cannot 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 18 describe what was seen. The mental consciousness, on the other hand, is said to be like a blind person who can speak––the blind person is able to describe things, but cannot see what color they are.  The Buddhist teachings on the six consciousnesses refuted the pre-Buddhist doctrines that asserted the existence of a single consciousness. These non-Buddhist theories held that there is only one consciousness, although it may seem as if there are many. They gave the example of a monkey inside a house with six windows. Sometimes, the monkey looks out the east window, sometimes out the north window, then out of the west window, and so on. An observer on the outside might think that there are six monkeys in that house, even though in fact there is only one. This analogy was given to explain how one consciousness could process information from the five senses and the mental consciousness.   The Buddha postulated a different view. He countered that there were six distinct consciousnesses, each with its own particular characteristics. The Buddha taught that if there were only one monkey inside the house, when it looked out of an eastern window, for example, then all the other windows would be empty. But when we see something with our eyes, our ears do not become deaf. When we listen with our ears, our eyes do not become blind. We can see, hear, and smell simultaneously within the same instant. Therefore there must be six separate consciousnesses.   These consciousnesses were described by the Buddha to be aggregates (Skt. skandhas), not single units. For example, when we perceive different colors, one consciousness does not simultaneously perceive all these colors. Instead a different part of visual consciousness perceives each color. Similarly, there are also different visual consciousnesses for shapes. In the same way, an aggregation of auditory consciousnesses is itself an aggregation of a multitude of momentary consciousnesses perceiving different sounds. Similarly, a collection of tactile aggregates experience the sensations of hands, feet, and other

 19 body parts moving simultaneously. The mental conscious is not just one thing that collates sensory information because it can also process, for example, by comparing it with events that took place in the past or even the future.6  The five sensory consciousnesses and the mental conscious-ness are impermanent. An image perceived by the visual consciousness is perceived for only an instant; it then ceases and is immediately followed by another visual image that lasts for only another instant. Therefore these six consciousnesses are aggregates of successive momentary experiences. The five sensory and the our discursive mental consciousness are also classed as momentary because their information constantly changes. For example, when we close our eyes there is no longer a visual consciousness perceiving visual images. The mental consciousness is characterized by the quality of luminous clarity (Tib. salwa)7 meaning it clearly perceives the object. As described below the seventh and eighth consciousnesses are not as vivid and apparent. They are classed as being “ever-present, but unclear” while the first six consciousness are classed as “temporary, but vivid.”  In the Mahayana teachings the Buddha described two additional consciousnesses. The seventh consciousness is called the “afflicted consciousness” and functions basically as the feeling of clinging to a self. This consciousness is very subtle in that it does not need to specifically think, “Is this me?” Instead, it is continuously and latently present, clinging to a self  6. Modern biology supports this: some retinal cells  process only round objects, some square ones, some moving ones, some just the color of the objects, and so on. It is only when all this information goes to the occipital lobe where it is put together into an image that the eye “sees” which Rangjung Dorje calls the “visual consciousness.” 7. Luminous clarity is a quality of mind covered in greater detail in later chapters. When we look for where thoughts originate, dwell, or go to, we cannot find them anywhere so we say they are empty or insubstantial. However, even though the mind is “empty” it has a continuous knowing, an awareness, and this is luminous clarity. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 20 subconsciously thinking, “this is me,” “these are mine” “that is not who I am”. This contrasts with the mental consciousness where the feeling of self is very conscious and discernible. The afflicted or “klesha” seventh consciousness is a neutral mental obscuration and in itself is neither positive nor negative. It does not create good or bad karma. However, the belief in a self directly opposes the wisdom of selflessness. This false belief in a self is the principle obstacle that must be removed to attain liberation.  The eighth consciousness is called the ground conscious-ness. It too is an aspect of luminous clarity and understanding that is ever present. No matter what kind of sensory perception occurs, this underlying continuity of consciousness is there. The eighth ground  consciousness  is the basis or “ground,” for all the other consciousnesses. It can be analyzed in terms of mind and mental events. The five mental aggregates that arise from the ground consciousness are form, feeling, identification, formation, and consciousness.8 In the seventh consciousness are the five mental aggregates as well as clinging to self, attachment to self, pride in self, and ignorance in relation to self. These mental events are like the transformations or the movements of the consciousnesses. When we look thoroughly and directly at the mind, we can identify each of these consciousnesses.  Among the eight consciousnesses, the sixth mental con-sciousness is the most important. The visual consciousness may see an image which may or may not be beautiful, the ear consciousness may hear a pleasant or unpleasant sound and so on. But it is the mental consciousness that decides if the sensory perception is beautiful or ugly, safe, dangerous, and so on. Liking a perception causes joy and attachment to it and can give    8. See Appendix A for a description of these five aggregates.

 21 rise to the disturbing emotions (Skt. kleshas).9 Experiencing an unpleasant sensory perception may bring about  suffering and a disturbance of mental clarity. When meditating, we use our unpleasant sensory perception may bring about  suffering and a disturbance of mental clarity. When meditating, we use our mental consciousness to calm and pacify the mind. Meditation pacifies all sensations and experiences of happiness and suffering, attachment and aversion. When all sensations have been pacified, the mind is clear and peaceful. We then rest in this clear and peaceful state. This completely natural and true state of the mind is ultimate wisdom. When this state of wisdom is attained, all of the eight consciousnesses are transformed into the five wisdoms.   This text describes these consciousnesses, explains how they function, and defines their transformation into the five wisdoms in detail. Therefore, it is called The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom.  THE TITLE  The Treatise Buddhist literature can be divided into two categories: The sutras which are the discourses given by the Buddha himself called ka in Tibetan and the shastras which are the subsequent commentaries written by the Buddhist masters. The Sanskrit word “shastra” was translated into Tibetan as tenchö with the Tibetan word chö meaning “to correct.” A shastra corrects ignorance, error, and delusion in the mind and changes them into wisdom. The shastra accomplishes this by teaching (Tib. ten) the true nature clearly. When the truth is understood, the mind is automatically corrected. Thus, a treatise is called tenchö in  9. The five major disturbing emotions (Tib. nyön mong), also translated as “afflictions”, are anger or aggression, desire or attachment, ignor-ance of the true nature of phenomena, pride, and jealousy. These emotions disturb the mind and lead to negative behavior.  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 22 Tibetan, meaning “correction through teaching.” This text is therefore a shastra; a tenchö that clearly teaches the nature of consciousness and wisdom in order to dispel our ignorance and delusion.   Distinguishing Rangjung Dorje differentiates consciousness from wisdom in this treatise by classifying them according to their respective natures. He does this in order to provide us with the knowledge necessary for successful meditation.  Consciousness It is due to consciousness that we do not have ultimate knowledge. The Tibetan word for consciousness is namshe. This term was derived from the Sanskrit vijnana. The Sanskrit word vijnana means “complete knowing” with the first syllable vi, meaning “total,” and the second syllable jnana meaning “knowledge.”   Consciousness does not create ignorance.10 It is a mind state of luminous clarity or knowing. However, what should be seen (i.e. the true nature of phenomena) is not perceived by consciousness. Rather what consciousness vividly perceives are false appearances and this results in a state of delusion that obscures the realization of ultimate wisdom.  from Wisdom The Tibetan word for primordial wisdom is yeshe which is a translation of the Sanskrit word jnana. The Sanskrit term, however, can also mean ordinary knowledge equivalent to the Tibetan word shepa. Therefore, the Tibetans translated jnana as  10. Ignorance in the context of the disturbing emotions does not mean being ignorant of something like doing algebra, but rather refers to believing that the world is solid and real and does not have an empty or insubstantial nature. 
An Introduction to the Text 
 23 “primordial wisdom” and added ye which means “primordial,” to she thus forming yeshe which means “primordial wisdom.”   The reason to meditate is to transform our confused mind from ignorance into wisdom and turn our erroneous beliefs into true knowledge. We meditate to change ourselves from being under the influence of the negative emotions to being free from them. So we are trying to change our impure state into a pure state. The impure state is our mind; the pure state is also our mind. While they are both mind, there is a great difference between these two states of mind. The impure states are termed consciousnesses (Tib. namshe), and the pure states are termed “wisdoms” (Tib. yeshe). If we can clearly understand the difference between consciousness and wisdom, then our meditation practice will be free from error and delusion. That is why this treatise on Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom is very important for the practice of meditation. It can help us realize the true path to buddhahood.  THE HOMAGE  1. I pay homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!11  The treatise begins with the homage and the commitment to compose the text. From the time that early Buddhist masters composed shastras in India until the present time, Buddhist treatises have always begun with an homage. Rangjung Dorje therefore begins his treatise with an homage to the worthy recipients who are the buddhas and the bodhisattvas.  The Buddha’s teachings are divided into three sections: the Vinaya (the instructions on correct conduct), the Sutras (the words of the Buddha), and the Abhidharma (a systematic classification of the teachings). A specific homage is associated with each of these three different types of teachings. This treatise belongs to the category of sutra teachings and is principally  11. The numbered verses are the original root text of Rangjung Dorje. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 24 concerned with meditation. The traditional homage for a sutra text is, “I pay homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas.” Thus, this homage is paid to the Buddha who taught the perfect Dharma and also to the bodhisattvas who are the practitioners of these teachings. He made this homage to ensure that there would be no impediments to the completion of the text and to ensure that it would benefit many people.  Rangjung Dorje pays homage to the Buddha who taught how to pacify all our disturbing emotions and misconceptions. He also pays homage to the bodhisattvas, those beings who practice the Buddha’s teachings. So by showing respect and devotion to the buddhas and bodhisattvas, our confidence in the teachings will grow. By having a firm confidence in the teachings, we will practice them. And by practicing the teachings, we will achieve the goal of Buddhahood.  THE COMMITMENT TO COMPOSE THE TEXT  2. I gained a thorough understanding through    hearing the teachings  And contemplating them.   I then resided in solitude, in order to engage  In the process of meditation that I shall describe here,  The kind of realization that arose at that time.  This verse expresses Rangjung Dorje’s commitment to compose this text. On an explicit level, Rangjung Dorje describes the process that resulted in his writing this text. Implicitly, these lines instruct us to do the same as he has done. It is as if he were saying, “This is what my followers should do in the future.” Rangjung Dorje was an emanation of Chenrezig, yet he humbly describes himself as an ordinary being. He says that he did not know how to practice properly so it was first necessary for him to develop an understanding of the words of the Buddha and the commentaries. Unable to do this by himself, he studied with a 
An Introduction to the Text 
 25 master to gain the understanding that arises from the “first” knowledge of listening to the Dharma.12  We shouldn’t believe something just because the Buddha or some great scholar says so. We need to have a very clear and profound conviction that the Buddha’s teachings are correct. This is gained through analysis and our own intelligence. Therefore, after our teacher has taught us the path, we should thoroughly analyze and contemplate the teachings and thus gain the understanding which arises from the second knowledge (prajna) of carefully contemplating the Dharma.  An understanding based on listening to and contemplating the Dharma is not enough. This alone cannot transform our mind. The final transformation is accomplished by the third knowledge gained from practicing meditation. How do we meditate properly? Rangjung Dorje explains this with, “I then resided in solitude.” Having developed complete certainty in the teachings, Rangjung Dorje then meditated on the teachings. He meditated in a solitary place so all the movements of his mind and unstable thoughts would disappear and be transformed into wisdom. Through this meditation he was able to realize the importance for others to understand the nature of the eight consciousnesses and the five wisdoms. And so he committed to compose this text.  We can’t achieve realization on our own. If we meditate with an inadequate understanding, we won’t be able to develop genuine meditation. Instead we need the help of someone who has had the experience of meditation. That someone is the Buddha who taught about the nature of meditation, gave the methods for meditation, and taught the purpose of doing meditation. We must first listen to the teachings of the Buddha. Then we must understand the teachings by contemplating them. After developing a definite understanding, we then have to  12. “To listen” to the teachings is the literal translation of the Tibetan talwa. Rinpoche has said that in this modern age this actually means “to study” the teachings. There are three knowledges or prajnas––listening, contemplating, and meditating on the teachings. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 26 meditate on the teachings. So we must engage all three prajnas to progress.  The Buddha taught that we must meditate to achieve realization. For example, we cannot convince someone that molasses is sweet by repeatedly telling them that it is sweet. Even though the person may understand our words, until that person tastes it, he or she will not have the experience of the sweet taste. It is the same for Dharma; we can listen to the teachings for a long time and contemplate them, but without meditation we cannot actually experience them. If, however, we taste the molasses, we will have the actual experience of its sweetness. Similarly, if we practice meditation properly by following the correct path and receiving the proper instructions, we will experience the Dharma. The King of Samadhi sutra says that to meditate properly one has to first receive instruction on meditation and then understand these instructions. There is a story of a sage or rishi, who meditated for twelve years without achieving any real results. He died and was reborn a cat. The reason he was reborn a cat and not a human, was that he had not received the proper meditation instructions. Consequently, the Buddha said we must first listen to the teachings and con-template them before we meditate on them. He said that he himself had also listened to the teachings of others, contemplated them, and then meditated on them. So his followers should do the same.   
 27  2  The Mind as the Source of Delusion and Non-delusion  THE ERRONEOUS VIEWS OF OTHERS   3.  There are those who believe that the three realms and    all beings   Are a creation arising from themselves, or from another,   From both, or from no cause.  There are those who state that there is a creator:   Gampo-Cha, Shiva, Brahma, or Vishnu,   Or that there are external atoms,  Or truly existing imperceptible matter,  That has created the self and the world.  In the past there have been many different teachers from many different traditions who have presented views on how to understand the nature of phenomena. They have taken positions much different from Rangjung Dorje’s view that external phenomena are created by the mind. We need to understand why these teachings of others are incorrect in order to have a clear understanding of how phenomena arise. Therefore Rangjung Dorje begins this spiritual song with a refutation of the inaccurate theories of how phenomena arise.  There are external appearances in the world and sentient beings within it. The Buddhist tradition describes the world in terms of three realms: the desire realm, the form realm, and the   
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 28 formless realm.13 Where did these realms come from? Some philosophical schools state that external  phenomena originate from the self, some state that things originate from other, and some state things originate from self and other, while some schools state that phenomena originate without any cause.  The last view held by the Charvakas who believed that the existence of the world and everything in it had no cause whatsoever. They illustrated their view with the example that peas are round, but no one has rolled them into that shape; thorns are sharp, but no one has sharpened them. Similarly, they contend that the entire world occurs naturally without any cause.   There are other theistic traditions that believed that there was a creator who made this world. This is the view of the Bon religion, which was the religion already present in Tibet before the introduction of Buddhism in the eighth century. These Bonpos stated that “Fortune” (Tib. cha) is the cause for the eventual attainment of prosperity and is also the creator of everything in the world.  In India there were three pre-Buddhist religions that believed in a creator: Shaivism, Brahmanism, and Vaishnavism. The Shaivites, followers of Shiva, believed that Shiva had a thought or dreamed, “this world is necessary” and that this created the entire world. The followers of Brahma believed that he gazed with his four faces into the four directions and from this he created the entire world. The followers of Vaishnavism believed that Vishnu, being very skillful and intelligent, created this world out of his own power.  The view that things arise without a cause as claimed by the Charvakas is easy to refute. If this were the case, then there  13. The lowest is the desire realm of our ordinary existence and in it we are dominated by desire. The form realm beings are born without physical body and have attained one of the four concentrations in a previous life. The third formless realm has beings with pure conscious-ness.  
All Appearances are the Mind 
 29 would be no point in planting seeds since there is no cause or reason for them to spout. If plants were created by Shiva or a god then there would be no point in planting seeds because the god would decide which plants would die and which plants to let grow. It is reasonable therefore to say that things are not created by gods because all things need a cause.  Among the Buddhist schools, there were different views on how outer phenomena were created. When the Buddha first began teaching, he gave teachings that were compatible to the understanding of his students. These became the Foundation Vehicle teachings and were intended for shravaka practitioners. In these teachings of the Vaisheshika school, the Buddha said that there was no creator. Instead everything was made up of minute atom-like particles. Another Foundation vehicle Buddh-ist school, the Sautrantikas, said that there were small invisible particles which were “hidden” from mind and that from these the self and the external world were created. Although these two schools taught there was no creator, their views were still not completely correct.  WHAT THE BUDDHA TAUGHT  4. The unique, Omniscient One taught that  Those three realms are purely mind.  They are not derived from themselves, nor from that    which is other,  Not from both, nor from the absence of a cause.  All phenomena arise through interdependence.  They are, by their own nature, empty,  Utterly free of being single or multiple,  Utterly free of being a falsehood or a truth,  Like the moon’s reflection upon water and so on.   Knowing this, the Buddha taught it to beings.  The Omniscient One (the Buddha) would teach according to the level of his students. He would often teach two different meanings: the definitive meaning and the provisional meaning. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 30 When the Buddha taught the definitive meaning, which describes the true nature of phenomena, he explicitly stated that all appearances in the three realms were mind. In these teaching on the definitive meaning, the Buddha said there was no external creator and that everything is created by, arises in, and perceived by mind alone.  There were four major schools of Indian Buddhism: the Vaisheshika, the Sautrantika, the Mind Only, and the Middle Way schools.14 There are actually two different Mind Only schools: one which says that appearances are mind and nothing else and the second that says that appearances were created by mind in the first place. This second school further taught that the three realms of existence, that is, all phenomena, did not arise due to a self, or through others, or through no cause at all. Rather it asserts that phenomena arise through interdependence with one thing  dependent upon another, and then another and so on without a creator being involved.  A simple example of this is given in Kamalashila‘s The Stages of Meditation which says that if one has a two-inch incense stick and a four-inch incense stick, the four-inch stick is clearly the longest and this is agreed upon by everyone. But if one then adds a six-inch stick and takes away the two-inch stick, then suddenly the four-inch stick is the shorter stick. So being long or short, big or small, right or left, etc. always depends on the interdependence with other objects rather than the nature or inherent quality of the object itself.15 The incense stick is not short or long in itself. That quality occurs only through dependence upon other phenomena and through the analysis by  14. These four schools and their views are discussed in much greater detail in Thrangu Rinpoche’s Shentong and Rangtong.  15. The word for “nature” or “essence” (Skt. svabhava, Tib. rangzhin) is found in Aristotelian logic in the West. For example, water has three appearances of being solid and cold (ice), of being transparent and fluid (water), and of being hot and vaporous (steam). Its essence or true nature is none of these appearances, but more like two hydrogen atoms combined with one oxygen atom.  
All Appearances are the Mind 
 31 the mind. Therefore, the Mind Only tradition taught that because of this, the mind alone is the basis for all appearances.   Without a creator deity being necessary, the mind is the source for everything because it is the mind that creates all actions, and therefore all karma. All happiness and unhappiness, anger, attachment, love, and compassion arise from the mind and nowhere else. So the mind is the source of samsara and nirvana.  In one sutra the Buddha said, “Oh bodhisattvas, the three realms are only mind.” That may make us think, “What about these houses, mountains, and fields that I see? They are all external to my mind!” However, when we see houses and fields in dreams, we think of them as being external objects that are not created by the mind, even though they are nothing other than projections of our mind. All that we see when we are awake is also nothing other than a creation of the mind.   We see objects such as houses, trees, and mountains on a gross level. In fact, if we look carefully, we realize that nothing exists as a single entity. Everything is actually made up of many components. For example, when we look at our hand, our mind conceives of it as a “hand.” Actually, it is made up of skin, flesh, bones, and different fingers. When we examine the thumb more closely, we see it is composed of a nail, skin, and different joints, etc. There is really nothing that we can look at that can be considered even the thumb, yet our mind says “thumb.” It is the same way for everything else: nothing exists as a single entity because it can always be broken down into smaller particles. Even if broken down to the smallest particle, we can analyze that particle and discover that this smallest particle has four sides—a north, south, west, and east. Therefore even the smallest particle cannot be defined as a single entity. Yet all these things seem to be singularities in our conceptual mind. They arise in the mind, that is, they are mental constructions, and therefore their source is the mind.

 32 HOW RANGJUNG DORJE GAINED REALIZATION  5. From what source does this  Delusion and non-delusion arise?  I have understood the nature of dependent origination,  In the same way that one sees one’s own reflection in a mirror,  And knows that there is fire because there is smoke,  And I shall clearly describe it here.  Buddhists believe everything appears in the mind just like an image appears in a mirror. Everything arises through inter-dependent origination similar to a reflection in a mirror. For a reflection to occur we need a visual image and also a mirror that reflects this image. It is the interdependence between the image and the mirror that allows us to see the image in the mirror.  This example illustrates interdependence on the ultimate level.16 Similarly, when we see smoke coming from a forest, we know that this is dependent upon fire so when that we see smoke, we know there is a fire there even if we cannot see the fire. This illustrates interdependence on the conventional level of reality.  Rangjung Dorje developed knowledge and wisdom from listening to the teachings and then developed an understanding that comes from contemplating them. Rangjung Dorje also received the actual practice instructions and teachings on the sutras and tantras from a guru in order to develop the understanding that comes from receiving the teachings. The sutras are the Buddha’s Mahayana teachings and the tantras are the Buddha’s Vajrayana teachings. He also received the  16. Ordinary beings see external phenomena as solid and real and experience existence as the ups and downs of samsara. On the level of relative reality (Tib. kunzop) the appearances we see and experience are, in fact, real like our belief of something is real while we are dreaming. But on the ultimate level of reality, external phenomena are, in fact, empty. Realized individuals can see through this illusion and discover that this ultimate level of reality (Tib. dondam) is not an accurate reflection of reality but, rather, is just an illusion. 
All Appearances are the Mind 
 33 teachings of the shastras, which are the commentaries on the Buddha’s teachings. Rangjung Dorje received all these teachings and contemplated them. Having realized the essence of reality through study and contemplation, he experienced the source of samsara and nirvana. He was able to see this clearly, just like one sees one’s reflection in a mirror.  Rangjung Dorje describes his realization in terms of the two truths. On the ultimate level of reality he realized the source of delusion and non-delusion, that is, the nature of phenomena. On the conventional level, he realized how phenomena arise through interdependence. Having attained these two realiza-tions, he described the consciousnesses and wisdoms.

 34   The Five Paths  Path of Accumulation We realize we want to overcome suffering and have a strong desire to renounce samsara. We accumulate all positive activities and abandon all negative activities.  We must also accumulate wisdom to help us on the way. We begin practicing mindfulness and recognizes the four marks of existence (impermanence, absence of a self, suffering, and emptiness)  Path of Junction We begin working on eliminating the sense of self  and learn how a belief in a solid self creates almost all our negative thoughts and activities. We begin practicing meditation and develop a conceptual understanding of emptiness of self.  Path of Seeing (Insight) We reach the level of realizing the emptiness of self and emptiness of phenomena. On this path we attains the first bodhisattva level of perceiving emptiness. We also develops true awareness of the Four Noble Truths and their 16 aspects and develop the seven factors of enlightenment).  Path of Meditation or Cultivation One practices the eight-fold Noble Path (right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right meditation).We begin an intense path of purification involving intense purification and developing great Wisdom. This level corresponds to the second through seventh bodhisattva levels.  Path of No-more-learning There is no more learning because we have reached a very high level of realization and have completely purified themselves. This is Buddhahood.  
 35  3  All Appearances are the Mind  THE FIVE SENSORY CONSCIOUSNESSES  6. The five sensory consciousnesses create afflictions  Because of holding and rejecting  Forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactility.  What are these sensory objects?  If the wise examine well, they will know that  Nothing, such as atoms and so on, exist externally,  As anything other than cognition.  The five sensory consciousnesses of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body perceive the five sense objects of visual forms, sounds, tastes, smells, and body sensations. Basically, all sights, sounds, and smells and so on are neither good nor bad, but some are perceived as being good and are accepted and some are perceived as bad and are rejected. These perceptions of pleasure and displeasure give rise to the afflictions or disturbing emotions (Skt. kleshas) which then cause all the suffering and illusory appearances of samsara.  If those who are endowed with wisdom carefully examine the cause of all this suffering and illusion and ask, “What are these sensory objects?” they will discover that although thoughts of beauty and ugliness, good and bad, and so on are associated with the sensory objects, these qualities are not actually inherent in the objects perceived. Instead these qualities come from the mind because there is no sensory object that exists inde-pendently outside that mind.    
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 36 THE FOUR CONDITIONS FOR PERCEPTION TO OCCUR  There are four conditions necessary for a perception of an external object to result in a disturbing emotion. The first condition, called the “causal condition,” is that the eighth ground  consciousness and the seventh afflicted consciousness have to be present.17 The second condition, called the “primary condition,” is the that the actual sensory faculty and its con-sciousness of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, or the body must be present. The third condition, called the “objective condition,” is that the external sensory object such as a sight or sound or smell must be present. Without this sensory object the sensory consciousness cannot arise. For example, the ear consciousness will arise because of a sound and a nose consciousness will arise because of a smell, and so on. So for these five sensory consciousnesses to arise there has to be an object that can be perceived by the sensory faculty. The fourth condition, called the “immediate condition,” is the continuum of the mind. Since the mind is a succession of individual instants––there’s a thought for one instant, then there’s another thought the next instant––this continuum must also be present.   When these four conditions come together, we have a sensory experience that results in the perception of something which is either pleasant or unpleasant or neutral. If we perceive something as being pleasant or beautiful, we are pleased and the disturbing emotion of desire or attachment will arise. If we perceive something as unpleasant or ugly, we will dislike it and gradually the disturbing emotion of aversion or anger will arise. If we see something that we think of as neutral, we will not see  17. Because one’s likes and dislikes are based on past experience and habitual patterns which are stored in the ground consciousness, this needs to be present in perception when there is any recognition of the object. The afflicted consciousness is present because one’s mind is still dualistic and this consciousness interprets everything in terms of “I” and “other.”  
All Appearances are the Mind 
 37 the true nature of the object and respond to it with the disturbing emotion of ignorance. So we can see from this that all the disturbing emotions come about as a result of perceiving an object that is automatically identified as good, bad, or neutral.  We experience happiness or unhappiness based on our per-ception. But even when we experience something as pleasant and enjoy it, we may later experience suffering related to this same object. Happiness is impermanent and will eventually become a source of suffering caused by the loss of this desired situation or object. This suffering associated with external phenomena then comes from the four conditions: the eight consciousnesses, the continuum of mind, the five senses, and their objects.  REFUTING THE VIEW THAT SENSORY OBJECTS ARE NOT THE MIND  7. If the substance of those sensory objects were other    than consciousness,   They could not both be a single entity.  A non-manifesting, immaterial awareness  Does not create material substance.  Therefore, a relationship where the latter arises from    the former, could not exist.  With this view that sensory objects are other than    consciousness,  It will become illogical for sensory objects to appear    from consciousness,  Because they would have no connection.  Before explaining how all external phenomena are mind, Rangjung Dorje refutes the view held by many that external reality is not the mind. He uses the argument that if external phenomena were other than the mind, then external phenomena would have a different nature than the mind. The view Rangjung Dorje is refuting here is the view that external phenomena are matter and that the nature of consciousness is awareness. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 38  If mind and external phenomena had completely different natures or essences, then there could be no connection or relationship between them because solid objects wouldn’t be able to arise out of the consciousness that perceived them. The only way that there could be a relationship between objects and their perceiver would be if they were to have the same nature and then the objects would be able to arise out of the consciousness perceiving them. The relationship between matter and consciousness must be either between things of the same essence or between things of a different essence. An example of things having the same nature is like seeing an elephant in a dream; both the nature of the elephant in the dream and the nature of us being there to see the elephant are the result of them having the same nature. An example of two things having different natures is like seeing an elephant while we are awake. In this case, there must be an instant of time between the elephant and the consciousness perceiving it. The elephant and our perceiving it cannot arise at exactly the same time; therefore, these two natures must have a relationship of cause (the elephant) and effect (us seeing it).  WHY EXTERNAL PHENOMENA ARE MIND18  8. Therefore, all these various appearances  Do not exist as sensory objects which are other    than consciousness.  Their arising is like the experience of self-knowledge.  All appearances, from indivisible particles to vast forms,    are mind.   This means that if nothing exists externally and separately,   Brahma and the rest could not be creators.   18. The complete title is “Explanation of the Five Sensory Conscious-nesses Accomplishing the Sensory Objects Without Any Other Creator.” 
All Appearances are the Mind 
 39 When we learn that external objects are only mind and they are not separately existing from mind, we might think, “Well, I can see them. They are made out of matter; therefore, they are different from mind which is not made up of matter but has the quality of luminous clarity or awareness. So mind and external objects are completely different things. One is solid matter and the other is luminous clarity.”   To refute this argument we can use the previous example of a hand. We say, “Oh, I see a hand.” But if we investigate more closely, we see a thumb, an index finger, a middle finger, ring finger, and a little finger, skin, flesh, and bones. We then ask, “Where is this hand that I see?” and we then continue look at the thumb and say, “I see a thumb.” But the thumb consists of the first, second, and third joints, and so on, and therefore, also is made up of many different parts. We know that none of these parts are the thumb, and ask, “Well, where is the thumb?” There is only one answer; there is no actual thumb. We see something and think we see a hand, but in fact there is no real hand there. It is only a conceptual fabrication coming from the mind. The same analysis applies to people, a mountain, a house, or any other external object.  The verse says, “Their arising is like the experience of self-knowledge.” We may hold the position that all external pheno-mena are composed of collections of real, minute particles and these indivisible particles are gathered together to make the external phenomena that we perceive. However, when we examine these small particles more closely, we find that we cannot divide them into the smallest particle because each particle can be divided into still smaller particles. So there is no such thing as a particle that everything is made up of and there is no reality in external phenomena. So we must conclude that all external appearances arise from mind.  We will never find an external object separate from our mind. We see things as being separate because since the beginning of time that we have spent in samsara, we have been habituated to the idea that phenomena exist externally. But all external

 40 phenomena, from the smallest indivisible particle to the largest mountain, appear from the mind alone. Many traditions say that the world and all beings inhabiting it were created by Brahma, Shiva, or Vishnu and that these gods created small indivisible particles which we could call atoms.19 However, everything we experience, whether pleasant or unpleasant, arises from our mind through the power of our karma and is not created by gods.  EXPLANATION OF THE MENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS  9. The relationship between the mental consciousness   and mental phenomena  Is like the experience of a dream.  The mind focuses on phenomena   And becomes attached to them.   But they are devoid of any true reality.  Although we may intellectually agree with the statement that all objects are only experienced by mind and don’t exist, we do not actually believe this. We believe that there are two separate things: external objects and an inner consciousness perceiving them. Although we believe them to be separate, the Buddha taught that these events are not external but are only mind. Ordinary logic disagrees with this. For example, if we were to say that this book that we are reading is our mind, we would think, “No, that is not true. The book was made by a printer, and did not come from our mind; it is an external object.” But when we dream, we also see external objects. Yet none of them have an independent external existence; they are all just mental creations. In the same way, all external appearances that we perceive are created by our mind and do not have any indepen-dent existence.  19. We translate these particles as “atoms” but actually physicists tell us these atoms described by Niels Bohr are not solid particles and behave very much more like waveforms. 
All Appearances are the Mind 
 41  The five sensory consciousnesses perceive sensory objects or events directly as mental images of visual forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and bodily feelings. These are then perceived by the sixth mental consciousness. However, the mental consciousness does not perceive the sensory objects directly, but instead as mental events. These mental images are sometimes termed dharmas which is translated as “phenomena,” meaning the purely mental phenomena that appear to the mind. The relationship between the mental consciousness and these mental phenomena is not direct, but rather like what is experienced in a dream. In a dream the mental phenomena appear to the sixth consciousness which believes them to be real. A similar process occurs when all the appearances in a dream arise internally to the mind and we are conceived of them also being real external phenomena. As a result we have a strong attachment to these images being external phenomena both in the dream and in waking.  The Pramana teachings describe mental consciousness as having two aspects—an external orientation and an internal orientation. The external orientation occurs when the mental consciousness becomes attached to a sensory form that is perceived by a sensory consciousness. For example, when there is a sound, a mental consciousness engages that sound. This is the external orientation of the mental consciousness.   The internal orientation of the mental consciousness is called “self-knowledge”––the mind being aware of itself. The Pramana states, “One’s own mind is not concealed from oneself.” We have to ask someone else what they are thinking about. However, we know exactly what we ourselves are thinking. This isn’t because our mind is looking at itself as if it were something else. There is no dualism of something that is seen and something that is doing the seeing. We don’t have to wonder, “What am I thinking?” because we clearly perceive the thoughts. This internal orientation of mental consciousness which looks at the mind itself is called rang rig in Tibetan and means “self-knowing.” Externally oriented mental consciousness is conceptual and inferential. When we look at something, for 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 42 example, we can compare it with previous sights, we can analyze it to determine its qualities, and we can name it. In contrast, internally oriented mental consciousness that looks at its own nature is nonconceptual and must be perceived directly. As ordinary (unenlightened) persons we can, by inference, understand that the mind is capable of seeing its own nature. But we do not have the direct experience or recognition of this self-knowledge. To recognize this self-knowledge directly, we have to engage in meditation to directly perceive the essence of the mental consciousness. After we have done that, we should rest in this non-conceptual state.  If we do not recognize self-knowing but engage in our ordinary mental consciousness, then we will become involved in the usual flow of thoughts and remain in a state of delusion. But if we can reject this externally oriented consciousness and rest in this self-knowing, we will have effective meditation. Therefore it is taught, “Rest like an infant seeing a temple.” When we bring a baby into a temple, the baby sees all the objects and images directly and doesn’t think, “Oh, that is a throne, that is the Buddha and its made of gold.” Instead, the baby just has a direct experience of the temple. During meditation, we should have this direct experience without thoughts and concepts and then we can experience self-knowledge.  In terms of meditation, the important consciousness is the sixth mental consciousness. When we are meditating, that involves a visualization. Some of us believe that we should see the visualization as clearly as in normal vision. However, in visualization we are using the mental consciousness, while in normal vision we are using a visual consciousness. Since the mental consciousness perceives the meaning of an object, it cannot perceive a clear picture in the way that the visual consciousness can. We cannot expect a visualization to be as clear as seeing an ordinary object. Also in Tranquility (Skt. Shamatha) and Insight (Skt. Vipashyana) meditation we use the sixth consciousness. We observe all the movements of thoughts 
All Appearances are the Mind 
 43 in our mind with this sixth consciousness that we are training in this meditation.  THE MIND IS BIRTHLESS20  10. These six consciousnesses,  The appearances of sensory objects and of beings,  The attachment to a self, cognition;  Whatever appearances are manifested  Are not created by anything which is other than themselves.  They are not created by themselves,  Nor created by both self and other,  Nor by the absence of both.  In the graduated path of meditation, it is first taught that all external phenomena are mind. This has been covered in the previous chapter and now we come to the discussion of how the mind itself, the six consciousnesses, have no inherent reality and are empty in nature. The verse begins by stating that all external appearances, the belief in self, and the internal thoughts and feelings appear are not external to us. These events or appearances are analyzed by Rangjung Dorje in the classic four-fold logic of Nagarjuna used in The Perfection of Wisdom (Skt. Prajnaparamita) teachings. These internal and external appear-ances are: (1) not created from themselves, (2) nor are they created from something outside themselves, (3) nor are they created from both themselves and other, (4) nor are they created from neither themselves nor other. In other words, they are empty by nature.  Rangjung Dorje then describes how all external things are mental manifestations. We may wonder if this is the same viewpoint held by the Mind Only school who assert that all  20. Here “birthless” means the mind was not born or created at a particular time or because of a certain set of causes and effects. The mind, through all its countless reincarnations, has remained this way since the beginning of time. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 44 external phenomena are mental manifestations and so pheno-mena have no true existence. The Mind Only school also holds the belief that the mind truly exists, which is why they are called the Mind Only school. Rangjung Dorje, however, goes further than the Mind Only school by stating in this verse that the mind is birthless, having the quality of being empty and possessing luminous clarity. The text states that external appearances have no true existence and that when we investigate our mind we discover that our mind also has no true existence.   The usual example given to show external appearances are empty is saying that a mountain that is “here” is different from a mountain over “there.” But there is no definite “here” or “there” mountain because the mountain over “there” becomes the mountain “here” when one goes across the valley. Therefore, mountains don’t have an intrinsic nature of being here or there; everything is instead interdependent with “here” depending on “there” and vice versa.  Similarly, we have what is “known” and “the knower” which also depends upon each other. When something is known, there is a knower; when there is a knower, something is known. If nothing were known, there would be no knower because the knower depends on what is known for its existence. If external objects have no true existence, then the mind also has no true existence. If visual forms have no true reality, then visual consciousness has no reality. If sounds have no reality, then auditory consciousness has no reality and so on for each consciousness. If external phenomena have no true reality, then the six consciousnesses have no reality. If sense objects have no reality, then the actual senses themselves and the sense organs have no reality; if the sense organs have no reality, then the consciousnesses that arise from them have no reality. Therefore, if both external phenomena and internal consciousnesses have no true reality, then neither a self nor clinging to a self has a true reality.   Even though there is nothing that inherently exists, things do obviously appear. We see a car and we open the door and climb 
All Appearances are the Mind 
 45 in and drive along the highway. A vast variety of appearances actually do appear to us and do have an effect on us. We wouldn’t, for example, deliberately drive our car into a wall. This is because appearances are a real part of the relative level of reality and they appear to us because our mind has the quality of luminous clarity. When this luminous clarity aspect of mind or knowing awareness is impure, we have consciousnesses. When this luminous clarity is pure, we have wisdom. However, neither this luminous clarity nor this wisdom has any inherent reality on the ultimate level. Thus, all appearances come out of luminous clarity, but have no inherent reality.  To summarize, external phenomena and inner conscious-nesses are not created by: (1) the self, (2) something other than the self, (3) both self and other, nor (4) neither self or other.21 Thus all external phenomena and the inner consciousnesses experiencing them have no true inherent existence.  THE SCRIPTURES ON THE EMPTINESS OF MIND  11. Therefore, as the Victorious One has taught,  All samsara and nirvana are just mind.  That all external phenomena are mind and that mind is empty can be proven through logic as this treatise has done. It can also be established by reading the scriptures of the Buddha. The Buddha taught that the mind is responsible for us attaining Buddhahood and mind is also responsible for us wandering endlessly in samsara. The Buddha has said that the mind is like an artist who paints whatever he wants. The mind uses the five mental aggregates of form, feeling, identification, formation, and consciousness to create whatever is perceived in the world.  Saraha (tenth century), one of the eighty-four mahasiddhas in India, said that the mind is the seed of everything. While we reside in our confused state in samsara, everything we  21. This is the tetralemma reasoning used by Nagarjuna and the Middle Way school. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 46 experience comes from the mind and when we achieve Buddhahood all the enlightened qualities and wisdoms also come from mind. Therefore when we use our mind properly, we can attain both the happiness of samsara and the happiness of nirvana. In this way the mind is like a wish-fulfilling jewel.22  Why is it that we are not always happy? It is that through countless lifetimes we have become thoroughly habituated to the false belief or delusion that external appearances are inherently existent or “real” and are distinctly separate from our mind.  This process of how mind creates phenomena is elaborated on in a sutra in which the bodhisattva Manjushri is asked by a deva, “Was the external world not created by someone?” Manjushri replied, “Son of deva, the external world was not created by anyone. It was not created by Bhrama, Shiva, or anyone else. The entire world was created through karmic latencies. When these imprints developed and increased, they formed the earth, the rocks, the mountains, and the seas. Everything was created through the development or propagation of these latent karmic potentials.” Then the deva asked, “How can all external forms arise out of latent karmic latencies? All these mountains, oceans, the sun and moon are so solid and so vivid. How can they arise out of latent karmic latencies in the mind?” Manjushri replied, “These things arise through the power of development and the propagation of thought.”   We have many examples of this in the East. For example, there was an old lady meditating on the visualization of herself being a tigress and she concentrated and focused so clearly that others actually saw her as an actual tigress. Also there is a well-known practice performed by monks to reduce their sexual desire by visualizing human bodies as containing all kinds of  22. This is a jewel that produces anything that is wished for. Thrangu Rinpoche says that in ancient times these did exist but they do not exist anymore. It is therefore a metaphor for attaining of Buddhahood because all of what one can wish for is fulfilled with the attainment Buddhahood. 
All Appearances are the Mind 
 47 impure substances such as pus and urine. Sometimes other individuals can see these monks as having rotten and putrid bodies. While these two examples are small occurrences lasting only for brief periods of time, we can imagine how large objects such as mountains have been produced by the minds of millions and millions of sentient beings since beginningless time.23       
 23. Thrangu Rinpoche also has given the example in the Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa where two academics came to Milarepa’s cave to discredit him. Milarepa asked them if a large rock in the cave was solid and they said, “Of course.” Milarepa then moved his body through the rock because he had truly realized emptiness of the rock and so it was no longer solid to him.  If  in  a dream you have a jewel box, and open it and find a diamond, and then you think, “Wow, I have a diamond, a real diamond,”  then that is the view of realism. But then you go somewhere else in your dream and open the box again and there is no diamond; then you have a very strong view of non-existence. There is nothing. But both the view of something and the view of nothing are just part of the confused dream.   Since it is the case that there was  never any diamond in the first place, there cannot be any non-existence of the diamond either. So both of these are just confused notions.      ––Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche

 The Twelve Deeds of the Buddha There are very many great deeds of the Buddha recorded but these can be summarized into the twelve most important deeds. 1. The first deed was when the Buddha was teaching in the paradise of Tushita which is in the god realm. 2. The second deed was his birth into the womb of his mother, Mayadevi who unfortunately passed away a week later. 3.The third deed was his birth in the garden in Lumbini (in present day Nepal). 4. Fourth, he trained in arts and sciences and thus became very knowledgeable, very scholarly, and very skillful. 5. The fifth deed was to marry, have a child, and enjoy the company of his queen Yashodhara and consorts with all the pleasures of royalty. 6. The sixth deed was his renunciation. He realized that, no matter how rich or how powerful you are, no matter how much pleasure and enjoyment you have, One cannot run away from the suffering of birth old age, sickness, and death. 7. The Buddha gave up his kingdom and left the life of a prince and led a life of austerities for six years by the banks of the Lilajan (Skt. Niranjana)  river in India. 8. The eighth deed was his giving up his practice of the austerities by accepting a bowl of yogurt and going to the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya) and vowing to stay there until he reached final awakening. 9. The ninth deed is called "the subduing of the mara Papiyan who was the leader of the maras. Maras are obstacles to practice. This happened while the Buddha was sitting under the bodhi tree. 10. The tenth deed was his enlightenment which he reached while meditating under the bodhi tree. 11. The eleventh deed occurred when began teachings and turned the wheel of the Dharma three times (with the last two turning occurring after his death.) 12. The twelfth deed was his body passing away at the age of 83 in the town of Kushinagar. 
 49  4  How the Eight Consciousnesses  Cause Delusion  The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom pre-sents an outline of the whole treatise in a brief form in the first eleven verses. We have now reached the point in the treatise where each of these points is covered in more detail.  THE SUMMARY OF THE EIGHT CONSCIOUSNESSES  12.  The causes, conditions, and interdependence,  Have been taught by the Buddha to be the six consciousnesses,  The afflicted consciousness, and the ground consciousness.  Causes, conditions, and interdependence are necessary con-ditions for things to arise in our mind; things don’t appear in our mind without reason. For example, to grow a flower requires the causal condition of a seed and the secondary conditions such as water, sunlight, and soil. Finally, interdependence of these causes is necessary; the causes and conditions must be in the right amount and occur at the right time. If a flower has too much water or not enough sunlight, it will not grow. Likewise, birth in samsara doesn’t just happen; its causes and conditions and their interdependence must be present for all the illusory appearances of samsara to arise.  The six consciousnesses are not a single entity, are imper-manent, and do not possess inherent reality. Rather they are an accumulation of many moments of consciousness. We assume, for example, that we have a single visual consciousness all day long. Upon close examination, however, we discover that a visual consciousness only arises when a sensory object contacts 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 50 the sensory organ. When this circumstance doesn’t occur, the visual consciousness ceases. When we see a red color, a visual consciousness perceives red arising for an instant and then ceases. This allows the next visual consciousness to arise and cease in the next instant. This process also applies to the other consciousnesses—an auditory consciousness perceives a loud sound and then a quiet sound and so on with consciousnesses continually arising and ceasing in a succession of instants.  The samsaric appearances that arise from these causes and conditions are of two kinds: common and individual. Some appearances are the result of identical causes created by many beings so that something will be seen by everyone in common such as everyone in a particular room seeing that it has two windows. However, there are certain individual causes and conditions which result in sentient beings having their own individual experiences of happiness and discomfort. For example, some people taste chili and think it’s delicious, while others taste it and experience a painful burning. Even though the flavor and the sensory organs of their tongues are the same, different individual experiences result. These different perceptions are due to different latencies from the past that have been laid down in the ground consciousness. The different karmic latencies cause individuals to have different perceptions and reactions to the six sensory consciousnesses.  THE OBJECTIVE CONDITIONS OF THE CONSCIOUSNESSES  13. The six consciousnesses are dependent on objective conditions   Which are the six sensory objects of form and so forth.  As previously mentioned, the arising of consciousness depends on four conditions: the objective condition or the sense objects; the primary condition or the sense organs; the immediate condition or the immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness; and finally the causal condition or the eighth ground con-sciousness. In more detail, the first objective condition is the 
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 51 image, sound, smell, taste, and tactile sensation that are perceived. These make the five sensory objects that arise in the sixth mental consciousness. These sensory objects are called “phenomena” because their images are appearing to the mind as raw perceptions of the sensory organs. A visual object is not directly perceived by the mind, rather a conceptual image of the visual form appears in the sixth consciousness. Similarly, when the mind conceives of a taste there is no perception of the actual taste. Instead, a concept of taste appears in the mind. So none of the sensory information of the five sensory organs are directly perceived by the mind. When any of the five kinds of sensory appearances arise in the mind, they become a sixth object. The six objects are the objective conditions necessary for the arising of the six consciousnesses. These images alone would not be able to give rise to the six consciousnesses without the primary condition of the actual sense organs themselves—the organs of the eye, the nose, the ear, and so on.  THE PRIMARY CONDITIONS OF THE SENSORY CONSCIOUSNESSES  14. Their primary conditions are the six sensory objects,  Which are luminous clarity endowed with form.  The primary condition or the main cause for perception are the five sensory organs. These are the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the body. Each organ creates a sensory consciousnesses which are not in the actual physical sense organs themselves. Rather the Abhidharma, which describes the elements of mind in great detail, says that the five sensory consciousnesses are actually “the basis of the organs.” As Rangjung Dorje says, “Which are luminous clarity endowed with form.” Luminous clarity is the faculty of cognition and gives the sensory consciousnesses the power perception or the sensation their “form.” Jamgon Kongtrul in his commentary give the actual physical form of the sense organs according to Tibetan medicine. The sensory faculty in the eye is said to be 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 52 like a flax flower, which is blue in appearance. The sensory faculty of the nose is like a knot in white birch, a hole shaped similar to an ear. The sensory faculty of the ear is like a row of very fine copper needles. The sensory faculty of the tongue is like a moon split in half and laid on the tongue. The sensory faculty of the body is said to be smooth and permeates the entire body, except for the hair and nails.24  Thus the six sensory consciousnesses arise as a result of the six sensory objects and six sense organs and together they add up to the eighteen elements of perception (Skt. dhatu, Tib. kham)25 which are responsible for appearances arising in the three realms.   THE SOURCE OF THE SIX CONSCIOUSNESSES  15. Both faculties and objects arise from the mind.  This manifestation of sensory objects and faculties  Is dependent upon an element that has been present  Throughout beginningless time.  The five noncognitive sensory consciousnesses perceive objects vividly because they do not discriminate between beautiful and ugly, desirable and undesirable, and so on. Nagarjuna compared these senses to an idiot who can see everything clearly, but cannot make judgements like “this is good, that is bad.” In contrast the sixth mental consciousness cannot directly perceive objects. Rather, it follows the information that is perceived by the sensory consciousnesses. Consequently, the sixth conscious-ness has only a rough or vague idea of external forms. The sixth  24. Pönlop Rinpoche has pointed out that anatomical texts describe very closely what Jamgon Kongtrul was describing. For example, the “fine copper hairs” are very similar to the microscopic hairs in the cochlea of the inner ear that are responsible for receiving sound and the division of the types of the taste buds of the tongue being separated into the front and back of the tongue. 25 See Page 94 for a list of the eighteen elements of perception. 
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 53 consciousness is, however, conceptual so it conceives of phenomena with all of it qualities based on past experience such as something being good or bad, liked or not, safe or dangerous, “a mother”, and so on.   Having established that there are sensory objects and sensory faculties, we may now ask, “Where did these external phenomena come from?” The answer is that all external pheno-mena—houses, mountains, people––are perceptions originated from the mind. They all arose out of the ground consciousness. How is this possible? The answer lies in the fact that since beginningless time we have been perceiving sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and bodily sensations and these perceptions have been creating imprints or latencies in the ground consciousness. Repeatedly experiencing a certain image will create a latency for that image. Eventually, that latency will manifest from the ground consciousness as a visual form again but it will be perceived as external to ourselves.26  Everything the mind thinks occurs within the mind itself. As mentioned before, the closest analogy of this process is a dream. Although dreaming does not have any connection to external objects, we become attached to perceptions in dreams when, in fact, these latencies are coming from the eighth ground consciousness. Because the mental consciousness believes dream phenomena and external objects are the same, we become attached to experiences in our dreams. Apart from our attach-ment to dreams, there is no connection between phenomena experienced in mental consciousness and external objects. This is why it is said everything appearing to the five senses arises only from mind.   26. An example of this is that as soon as a child learns the word for “chair” the child will recognize lawn chairs made of fabric, a throne, a box on the ground, even an indent in a rock on a mountain as a “chair.” Western psychology cannot explain this phenomena or similar phenomena which also occurs in animals.  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 54 A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE SIXTH CONSCIOUSNESSES  16. Though a sensory consciousness perceives an object,  Its particular characteristics are known by the mental    event of identification  Which is dependent upon the mental consciousness,  The immediate mentality and the afflicted mentality  Briefly, we’ll now explain the difference between the view of the Mind Only school associated with Asanga and the Middle Way school associated with Nagarjuna. The Mind Only (Skt. Chittamatra) followers believe that all phenomena are mind; the Middle Way (Skt. Madhyamaka) followers believe that all phenomena are empty. This text by Rangjung Dorje takes a position based on the experience of the mind in Mahamudra meditation by first teaching that all phenomena are the mind and then describing the empty nature of the mind.  It is easier for us to first recognize that the nature of all pheno-mena are the mind and, after gaining that direct recognition, we can realize that mind itself is empty. Rangjung Dorje presents this way first by simply presenting the Madhyamaka view that phenomena are empty which is difficult to understand without a great deal of study and contemplation. Thus Rangjung Dorje first teaches that all phenomena are the mind and then teaches how the mind itself is birthless.  The sixth mental consciousness is called the “subsequent mind” (Tib. dema tak yi) in this verse meaning the consciousness following immediately upon the arising of a sensory perception. As soon as a sensory perception occurs, the thought of that form immediately arises. The other senses also have these “sub-sequent minds” immediately following perception. The sixth mental consciousness, like the sensory consciousnesses, also exists in one instant and then that instant ceases into the next instant and this continuity of thoughts is do to the immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness. 
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 55  This verse introduces how the other consciousnesses fit in with the sensory consciousness in the process of perception. Even though the sensory consciousnesses perceive external sense objects, they are not recognized or perceived as a solid external object until this perceptual process reaches the sixth mental consciousness and the object is identified. The mental consciousness, however, does not have a storage or a memory of all the objects—these comes from the seventh and eighth consciousness. The seventh consciousness has two aspects or functions:  the immediate aspect which ensures the continuity of the mind and the afflicted (Skt. klesha) aspect that is responsible for the continual belief in “I” responsible for creating the disturbing emotions.   THE IMMEDIATE ASPECT OF THE SEVENTH CONSCIOUSNESS  17. The first of those is immediate aspect because   It is the condition for the arising and ceasing of the    six consciousnesses.  It occurs in the same numbers as those of  The momentary arising and ceasing of the six consciousnesses.  It can be recognized by a mind that is yoga-endowed  And also through the teachings of the Victorious One.  The third of the four conditions needed for perception to occur is called the immediate condition. There are two aspects of the seventh consciousness––the immediate and the afflicted aspect––are always present in the first six consciousnesses. For example, the instant a visual object is seen, the visual conscious-ness ceases, allowing the next instant of consciousness to arise. This sequence applies to all six consciousnesses. The immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness of mind allows for the arising and cessation of the six consciousnesses because when a consciousness ceases, it does not disappear; instead it subsides into the eight ground consciousness. The immediate aspect is the condition where all appearances arise from the sensory 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 56  consciousnesses and when that instant is over, it goes into the ground consciousness.  How does the immediate mentality cause instants of the mind to arise? An instant of mind cannot arise if there isn’t a preceding instant of mind that ceases. There has to be a continuum of instants that immediately follow the preceding instants. When one instant of mind ceases, a latency in the ground conscious-ness immediately manifests as the next instant of mind. This power of immediacy never ceases. It is continually present, so that the continuity of the mind is never interrupted.  How do we know this to be true? This verse says this can be perceived by the “yoga-endowed.” The word yoga is Sanskrit for “union” and in this context it refers to the union of Shamatha and Vipashyana meditation. By perceiving our mind directly with Shamatha and Vipashyana meditation, we can observe the immediate mind. Because of the immediate consciousness, an instant of consciousness moves into the ground consciousness as soon as it ceases. The other method for perceiving this power of immediacy is by studying the Victorious One’s (the Buddha’s) teachings.   It has previously been explained that all phenomena arise from the mind and how the mind itself is empty. With everything in samsara and nirvana appearing to our mind, we discover that the mind itself manifests as the eight consciousnesses. We sentient beings all experience phenomena differently, For example, two people can go to the same movie and one will love it and the other will hate it. Also sentient beings in the six different realms of samsara experience phenomena differently. Hungry ghosts,27 for example, will see all kinds of desirable foods, but because of their previous karma, they will perceive  27. Thrangu Rinpoche teaches that because ordinary beings can’t see certain beings, such as hungry ghosts, this does not mean they do not exist. In fact, the Buddha asked that paintings of the six realms be placed in temples and then bodhisattvas would journey to these realms and came back and describe what they had seen.  
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 57 them as pus and feces instead so they won’t eat them.28 All experiences, whether happiness or suffering, are due to particular causes and conditions. The basic cause of these experiences is the eighth ground consciousness, the alaya consciousness. We can begin to understand the functioning of the ground consciousness through our daily experience. We have basic luminous clarity which is an awareness or a continuous knowing. When we look, hear, think and so on, there is always a continuity of the mind; a knowing that accompanies us from birth until death though our rebirths with the continuum of this luminous clarity being present until we achieve Buddha-hood. Every action we take creates a karmic imprint and these latencies or tendencies will automatically flow into the ground consciousness where they are stored. These karmic latencies do not, however, remain permanently stored because they will manifest sooner or later and become experiences in samsara.  THE AFFLICTED ASPECT OF THE SEVENTH CONSCIOUSNESS  18. The second is an aspect of this immediate mentality.  It is called the afflicted-mentality because  It believes the mind as self, possesses pride,  Has attachment to the self is ignorance,  And gives rise to all the destructive views.  After the immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness, the text commences explaining the second aspect of the seventh consciousness. The aspect of the seventh consciousness often called the “afflicted consciousness” or the “klesha conscious-ness” because it is the ever-present feeling of “I” or “self” which becomes the basis of ego. The afflicted aspect of the seventh consciousness is present in all sentient beings as a very subtle clinging to a self which is often explained in terms of mind and  28. The six realms of samsara are graphically shown in the Wheel of Life painting. The hungry ghosts are depicted as having an large stomach and only a extremely small throat.  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 58 mental factors.  Mind and mental factors refer to the luminous clarity of the mind which experiences the wisdom of the nature of phenomena. Mind is the basic awareness and includes all the consciousnesses. The mind gives rise to the 51 mental factors as listed in the Abhidharma.29  The difference between mind (Tib. sem) and mental factors (Tib. sem yung) is that mind is a collection of all that is present when thinking, while mental factors are more like long-term dispositions. Mental factors may be positive such as the ten virtuous factors which include faith, shame, and non-hatred and so on; negative factors such as the six root afflictions such as desire, anger, and pride, and the twenty secondary afflictions such as jealousy, avarice, and dishonesty among others; and also neutral such as the five aggregates, sleep, examination, and analysis. There are 51 mental factors according to most systems of Buddhism.   The afflicted aspect of the seventh consciousness is described in terms of four mental events: (1) clinging to a self by thinking there is a “me” and “I”; (2) pride which is believing the “I” is superior; (3) attachment to the self which is believing oneself more deserving than others; and (4) ignorance that accompanies the above three and involves ignoring how things truly are. We may wonder whether the afflicted mind is good or bad. Generally, there are three types of actions or karma: good actions done with the motivation to help others, negative actions done with the motivation to harm others, and neutral actions such as walking, eating, or sitting which have neither a good or bad motivation. There are two kinds of neutral actions: those that do not obscure liberation, and those that do. Walking somewhere does not cause an obscuration or prevent liberation, whereas just sitting around all day for no reason is an obstacle to liberation. Yet, in itself the afflicted mind is not good or bad because if we think something like, “Oh, I must do good actions and need to accumulate merit” subsequent actions are good, and conversely,  29. See Appendix D for a list of these 51 mental factors. 
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 59 “Oh, I have to lie because I did something bad” the subsequent action becomes negative.  Rangjung Dorje presents a fairly unique view of the seventh consciousness. Generally, what was taught by the Buddha in the Mahayana teachings were called the sutras and when the Buddha’s teachings were translated into Tibetan, they were placed in a collection called the Kangyur. The Buddha’s instructions on meditational deities and Vajrayana practice were called the tantras. There are two sections to the Kangyur: one dealing with the sutras and one dealing with the tantras. Instead of just using the sutras for his text, the Third Karmapa used both the sutras and the tantras. His description of how the eighth consciousness stores karmic latencies is clarified in a tantra called The Tantra of the Vajra’s Point which deals with how the mind perceives external phenomena. In the sutras of the Kangyur we find texts of the Mind Only school that teach on the eight consciousnesses and in this was taught that the seventh consciousness was only an afflicted consciousness underlying a continuous belief in a self, but was not involved in the immediate condition. Rangjung Dorje’s own special view, however, combines this sutra and tantra view adding the Middle Way view to the Mind Only view so that it is taught in this text that the seventh consciousness has the aspect of immediate mentality as well as afflicted mentality.  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IMMEDIATE  AND AFFLICTED SEVENTH CONSCIOUSNESS  19. The immediate mentality, which is instantaneous  Upon the cessation of the six consciousnesses,  Is the location for the arising of those consciousnesses.  The afflicted mentality is the location for the afflictions.  Therefore, mentality has two aspects  Due to their power to create, and its power to obscure.  Another way to look at mind is to consider it as a succession of instants rather than a single entity. The moment an instant of 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 60 consciousness arises, it ceases, allowing the next instant of consciousness to arise. Within this progressive succession of instants, external objects are perceived. We may think that the presence of an external object causes sensory consciousnesses to arise, and therefore that an external object is the causal condition, and that the sensory consciousnesseses are its effect. However, if an external object were the cause and the consciousness were the effect, then what would happen when the instant passed?30 If we perceive the effect, then the cause must have ceased, meaning that the object would have ceased. If a consciousness were the result of continuous instants of consciousness, and its cause had existed in the previous instant, then the consciousness (the effect) would not be present when the object is present (the cause). They would not be connected and, therefore, have no relation-ship because one cannot be the cause and the other the effect. We may claim that these instants of consciousnesses exist at the same time in a cause and effect relationship. Yet if they existed simultaneously, there would be no need for a cause, because its effect would already be present. Therefore, it is not logical to claim that an external object is the cause for a sensory consciousness of that object.   Non-Buddhist and Buddhists of the Foundation Vehicle say that the mind and external objects are different. However, if we carefully analyze the situation, we discover that external objects and internal mind are one. External objects actually arise from the mind, just like in a dream. In a dream we see images, but there are no images that exist outside of our mind. In a dream we see, hear, smell, taste, and feel bodily sensations, but there are actually no sounds, smells, tastes, or sensations existing outside our mind. Yet we perceive these appearances even though they  30. Thrangu Rinpoche is employing an argument using Madhyamaka logic which might not be familiar to Western readers. For example, if we have a seed and it grows into a tree, the seed is the causal condition and the tree is the effect. When the plant is a tree (the effect), then the seed (its cause) no longer exist. 
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 61 are not real. Similarly, while waking everything we see is an appearance which arises from our mind.  Finally, Rangjung Dorje summarizes the two main functions of the afflicted consciousness. The afflicted consciousness is the source or “location” for the arising of disturbing emotions. It is continuous and holds the belief in a self that gives rise to all our desire, anger, ignorance, envy, pride, and so on. This verse then concludes that the seventh consciousness has two aspects: creating continuity of the six consciousnesses (the immediate aspect) and the belief in a self (the afflicted aspect) that obscures the attainment of liberation.  THE GROUND CONSCIOUSNESS  20. To those with superior understanding,  The Buddha taught the “ground consciousness.”  It was also named the “foundation consciousness.”  The “location consciousness,” and the “acquiring     consciousness.”  All the actions created by the other seven consciousnesses  Are accumulated distinctly and impartially within it  Like rain and rivers flowing into the ocean.  Therefore it is also named the “ripening consciousness.”  The first two lines of this verse is a brief explanation of the eighth ground consciousness and the rest of the lines give a detailed description of this consciousness.  The fourth causal condition for a perception to occur is the main causal condition, ground consciousness.31 The ground or alaya consciousness was not described in the Foundation vehicle texts. Rather they describe only the first six consciousnesses––so the seventh and eighth consciousnesses were not taught in the  31. The four causal conditions are: (1) external object, (2) sensory con-sciousness, (3) the immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness, and (4) the ground consciousness.  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 62 Buddha’s early teachings. This is because the ground conscious-ness could have incorrectly been assumed to be permanent and therefore would make it the same as the nonBuddhist belief in a permanent self (Skt. atman). However, the ground conscious-ness is not a permanent self because its nature is emptiness. The eighth consciousness is the source of all samsaric appearances. We have a great attachment to our self, but this isn’t true for the ground consciousness. In the Abhidharma teachings, however, the Buddha said, “I have explained the ground consciousness to those who are pure,” meaning that the ground consciousness was introduced to Mahayana bodhisattvas or “those with superior understanding” in this verse.  The ground consciousness has many functions so Rangjung Dorje explains these by giving each function a different name. The first function is called the “basis consciousness” because this consciousness is the basis or foundation for the mind; it is also called the “location consciousness” because it is the location of the mind, and it is called the “acquisition conscious-ness” because it has the function of storing the karmic latencies.  The reason the Buddha taught the existence of the ground consciousness is that when our karma accumulates, the latent karmic latencies (Tib. bakchak) settle in the ground conscious-ness and remain there to express themselves at a later time. These karmic latencies will awaken or be energized at a later time as being experiences of suffering or experiences of happiness. Having a lot of positive karma doesn’t immediately lead to happiness; so doing many positive deeds will not automatically result in having a rebirth in the higher realms. Rather, the karmic latencies rest or lie dormant within the ground consciousness to arise later on with a result, for example, the joy of being reborn in a slightly more favorable situation. Similarly, accumulated negative karma does not express itself immediately as rebirth in the lower realms, but the karmic latencies remain in the ground consciousness to ripen when triggered by the appropriate circumstances causing suffering 
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 63 later on. Thus the ground consciousness can be said to be the “ripening consciousness.”  Our negative and the positive qualities increase due to habituation. For example, if we become angry again and again we will become habituated to behaving angrily, causing the latency of anger to increase in our mind. The same is true with desire. When we desire something again and again, the latencies of the desired person or thing or situation is increased. This process of karmic latencies also occurs for the positive qualities so a person who does not have much love, compassion, or wisdom can do acts of love and compassion and the imprints of these positive qualities in the form of latencies will increase in the ground consciousness.   If there were only six consciousnesses, thoughts would arise and cease without anything left to increase or develop the ability to achieve Buddhahood. The increase of these positive qualities in the mind occurs only because these positive tendencies are planted in the ground consciousness.   The ground consciousness is the foundation and location for the mind because all the karmic latencies are stored in the ground consciousness. A momentary sensory consciousness instantly ceases when the next new sensory instant appears. Similarly, an event in the mental consciousness is created and ceases instantly; sometimes an event in the mental consciousness does not appear at all. However, the latencies of mental events in these consciousnesses are contained in the ground conscious-ness. As a result we can remember a visual perception that oc-curred in the past; and when we remember it, it strengthens the latency of this memory.   The ground consciousness is very important for our Dharma practice. If we do not maintain mindfulness and awareness, our disturbing emotions will gradually increase from day to day and from lifetime to lifetime. However, if we develop mindfulness and awareness, our mind will gradually improve because these karmic latencies will be established in the ground consciousness. For example, when we begin to practice, we may not have much 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 64 love and compassion expressed in our meditation. But if we persist and meditate on love and compassion, then through the gradual accumulation of these positive latencies in the ground consciousness, we will gradually progress to where our medita-tion will contain vast love and compassion.  The ground consciousness is very important in terms of Dharma practice because through meditation our mind can overcome our negativity. By habituating ourselves to positive thoughts and actions, negative imprints will decrease and our positive qualities will increase. In fact, the Tibetan word for meditation is very similar to habituation.32 By developing samadhi, our negative tendencies can be transformed into positive imprints which, if practiced continuously, can be increased until we attain Buddhahood.  We can witness the effect of latencies in our daily life. Some children are very intelligent and some are not. This is due to the presence or absence of karmic latencies from their previous lifetimes. Some children are naturally very kind due to the positive latencies laid down in their ground consciousnesses in previous lifetimes and some children are very aggressive due to negative latencies in their ground consciousness. We can also see aggressive children who have bad behavior improve gradually through the cultivation of mindfulness and aware-ness as they grow older. In terms of Dharma practice we can, with the right training, slowly establish new latencies for developing love, compassion, and humility. Conversely, some good children grow up to be bad due to the negative latencies they developed during their childhood.  The eighth consciousness, besides being a store house, is also the foundation of experience. Should someone be born into a higher realm such as the god, jealous god, or human realm and then fall into the lower realms, their experiences would also be  32. The Tibetan word for meditation is “gom” (spelled sgom) and the word for habituation is “khom” (spelled goms). So the word for medita-tion has the same root as the word for habituation. 
How the Eight Consciousnesses Cause Delusion 
 65 based on the ground consciousness. Thus the eighth conscious-ness is the basis of all experiences within samsara including future experiences. Creating imprints in the present leads to experiencing their results in the future, for instance, a child who goes to school and studies hard will create an imprint that will allow the child to become a teacher later on. If the child had no learning, there would be no imprint, and no possibility of becoming a teacher in the future. This is how the eighth con-sciousness functions, why it is responsible for our whole experience of phenomena in samsara, and why it is also called “the consciousness of acquisition.”  The five sensory and the sixth mental consciousness can be either positive, negative, or neutral. The seventh (afflicted) consciousness is neutral but it is usually negative because it is influenced by the concept of “I” and “other” and therefore it becomes the basis for the disturbing emotions. The eighth (ground) consciousness is also neutral; however, it is not obscuring like the afflicted consciousness but instead it has an aspect of luminous clarity. This clarity allows all phenomena (places, bodies, appearances, and so forth) to manifest yet it does not obscure liberation.  The first seven consciousnesses create positive and negative imprints in the eighth consciousness. A analogy of how this occurs is given in the text: when it rains, the water naturally flows into the rivers, and whether the rivers are dirty or clean, they naturally flow into the ocean. Similarly, positive and negative imprints naturally flow into the ground consciousness which is compared to the ocean.  21. As it creates everything,  And is the ground from which all seeds sprout,  It is described as “the causal condition.”  However, because it is eliminated  When the seven consciousnesses are negated,  It is also called the “conditional consciousness.”  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 66 All karmic latencies or seeds, both good and bad, that are within the ground consciousness manifest as the other seven consciousnesses.33 It is as if the ground consciousness were the ocean and the other seven consciousnesses were waves that appear upon its surface. The ground consciousness is respon-sible for all illusory appearances, but it is not the basis of Buddhahood because buddhahood is freedom from delusion. This is why the eighth consciousness is a consciousness and not a wisdom.  To summarize this section, there are eight different con-sciousnesses within the impure state of our mind. The ground consciousness is the source of all delusory experiences, but is not the basis of Buddhahood because the nature of the ground consciousness is delusion and not in harmony with the true nature of reality. When Buddhahood or the level of an arhat is attained, the ground consciousness is transformed. When the ground consciousness is completely purified, all of the eight consciousnesses are automatically transformed into five wisdoms. So there are impure consciousnesses and pure wisdoms. This text has also shown that the root of samsara and nirvana is the mind, and that the mind itself is birthless.   5  The Transformation of the Consciousnesses into the Wisdoms   33. This verse points to a “feedback loop” because the sensory conscious-nesses could not identify something, if there weren’t seeds in the eighth consciousness identifying the input as being “a house,” “my mother,” or “a dangerous smell” and so on.  
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 67 THE FIVE WISDOMS AND THE THREE KAYAS  Jamgon Kongtrul has written a commentary on this text by Rangjung Dorje called The Adornment of Rangjung Dorje’s View. In it Jamgon Kongtrul has added information on how the five aggregates are transformed into the wisdoms at the time of Buddhahood. Although this does not appear in Rangjung Dorje’s root text, it will be helpful to discuss it here.  The five aggregates (Skt. skandhas) literally mean “heaps” and are form, sensation, perception, formation, and conscious-ness.34 Each of these aggregates is transformed as the person approaches enlightenment. The aggregate of sensation (which includes the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the all-pervasive suffering) transforms into freedom from suffering as well as an unbroken continuity of great bliss. The aggregate of perception is transformed into the unhindered ability to teach the Dharma. The aggregate of formation is transformed into the abilities to do miracles and to gather Dharma students. Finally, the fifth aggregate of consciousness is the same as the sixth consciousness with the conceptual part of the six consciousnesses being transformed into the dharmadhatu wisdom at enlightenment.  Jamgon Kongtrul then describes the four causal conditions for Buddhist practice that give rise to four buddha wisdoms. First, by practicing the two prajnas of hearing and contemplation of the full range of the Buddha’s teachings (the Vinaya, the Sutras, and the Abhidharma) will cause mirror-like wisdom to develop. Second, by engaging in the prajna of meditation to help all sentient beings, without having any partiality to friends or any aversion to enemies, will cause the wisdom of equality to develop. Third, by giving Dharma teachings with the pure motivation of love and compassion and the desire to help all sentient beings will cause discriminating wisdom to develop.  34. See Appendix A for a fuller description of the five aggregates of perception. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 68 Finally, by doing activities to benefit others will cause the all-accomplishing wisdom to develop. These four activities give rise to four wisdoms and we should note that the realization of the true nature of phenomena will cause the fifth dharmadhatu wisdom to develop.  THE THREE KAYAS  There are literally three bodies of the buddha (Skt. kayas). These are the dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and the nirmanakaya. The dharmakaya is the pure realm of complete enlightenment. This manifests as the sambhogakaya which is a pure realm where only realized beings (bodhisattvas and buddhas) can visit and receive teachings. Finally, the Buddha manifested in the nirmanakaya which is our earthly realm inhabited by all beings in samsara.  By diligently listening and contemplating the Dharma and meditating on it, we are able to slowly eliminate our disturbing emotions and gradually develop the wisdom of realizing the true nature of phenomena. We progress through the ten bodhisattva levels terminating in the attainment of Buddhahood. At this point we have completely eliminated the causes of samsara, negative karma, and the disturbing emotions. Our suffering is replaced with the experience of great bliss and peace. This is the first benefit of Buddhahood.   Upon attaining Buddhahood we also eliminate all obstacles to our wisdom and attain perfect realization or “omniscience.” This benefits others because with this knowledge we can show them how they too can attain Buddhahood. The complete elimination of the disturbing emotions and the cognitive obstructions is the dharmakaya or literally, “the body of the Dharma.” This elimination of all emotional and cognitive obstacles is illustrated by the Tibetan word for the Buddha which is sang gye. The Tibetan word for the Buddha is sang gye. The syllable sang means “awakened” from the sleep of ignorance and gye means “to open up” like a flower. So sang-gye means 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 69 “awakened from all the emotional disturbances, all the delusions.”   The dharmakaya is principally an emanation of the Buddha’s mind and has three qualities to help sentient beings: the quality of complete wisdom, which manifests as compassion for all sentient beings, and it has the power to provide refuge for all sentient beings. The dharmakaya is often divided into two different kayas: the dharmakaya and the svabhavikakaya. In this division the dharmakaya is the complete knowledge of how things are (Tib. ji ta pa) and the complete knowledge of the variety of phenomena (Tib. ji nye pa). Connected with the dharmakaya is the unity of all three kayas called the “svabhavikakaya” so we can say there are four kayas.  The luminous clarity of the dharmakaya’s wisdom is the mirror-like wisdom. All images whether a king’s castle or rotting meat appear clearly in this mirror-like wisdom just like an image appears in a mirror. While being clearly perceived by this wisdom, there is no attachment to these appearances in the dharmakaya. The Buddha is able to clearly see human being’s purity and impurities, their delusions and suffering. Due to mirror-like wisdom everything is precisely known by the Buddha. Whatever is reflected in the mirror of this wisdom appears unmistakably, that is, white does not appear as yellow or yellow does not appear as red. Similarly, the dharmakaya perceives things or phenomena as they really are.  The sambhogakaya comes from the Sanskrit word sambhoga meaning “enjoyment” and kaya literally meaning “body.” This kaya refers to the spreading of Buddha’s activity to all who are interested in receiving teachings. Usually, enjoyment has another connotation of having wealth and pleasure, but that is not the enjoyment of a buddha. Enjoyment, in this context, refers to buddha activity bringing all bodhisattvas to the state of Buddhahood which is complete enjoyment. The sambhogakaya encompasses two wisdoms: the wisdom of equality and discriminating wisdom. With the wisdom of equality, everything is seen impartially and there is no distinction between important 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 70 and unimportant, self and other, best or worst and so on. This, however, does not mean that a buddha cannot discern good from bad, suffering from bliss, delusion from non-delusion. In the sambhogakaya we can discriminate between these qualities because it has the second wisdom––discriminating awareness––in which all phenomena are distinguished completely, accurate-ly, and impartially.   Some individuals have no aspiration to receive Dharma teachings because of their various dispositions and interests. Because of this, the buddhas manifest in the nirmanakaya in many different ways. In the sutras it is written that some persons enter the Dharma path by encountering the actual Buddha. Others enter the path upon hearing a buddha’s teachings like Shakyamuni’s student Shariputra who completely understood the Buddha’s teachings by just hearing them once. Still others entered the path after seeing miracles being performed. This being the case the Buddha sent followers like Maudgalyayana35 to perform miracles. Yet others entered the path by observing the Buddha’s behavior, Shakyamuni’s pupil, Upali, was impressed by the Buddha’s perfect behavior of dressing correctly, walking with discipline, and speaking kindly. All are example or all-accomplishing wisdom activities of the nirmana-kaya.  The Buddha, being completely free of delusion, can correctly teach other sentient beings and free them from delusions so that they, also, will be able to perceive the true nature of phenomena. The wisdom that sees the true nature of phenomena is the dharmadhatu wisdom belonging to the svabhavikakaya.  THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE GROUND CONSCIOUSNESS36  35. Maudgalyayana was one of the Buddha’s ten main disciples and he lead the third council of the Buddhist teachings. His recitation of the Buddha’s words was said to be blocked by demons, so Maudgalya-yana had to perform miracles to scare off these intruding demons. 36. The complete title of this section is “The mirror-wisdom explained as the dharmakaya, in terms of purifier and purified.” 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 71  22. This ground consciousness,  Which is the identity of everything external and internal,  Is the source of everything that should be eliminated.  It has been taught that it will be overcome  By the “vajra-samadhi.”  We now return to the root text on the five wisdoms that begins with an explanation of the transformation of the ground consciousness into these five wisdoms.  As mentioned before, Rangjung Dorje uses a Mahamudra view of the ground consciousness which is a little different from how it is traditionally presented by the Mind Only school who held that the ground consciousness truly exists and is the source of all of samsara and nirvana. If the ground consciousness were the source of nirvana, then we would have to conclude that the ground consciousness continues after the attainment of Buddhahood. However, in Rangjung Dorje’s treatise the ground consciousness is said to be completely empty and the foundation from which all the delusions of samsara appear. It is the storehouse containing all the karmic latencies of samsara. Although its nature is neutral, and it does not actively impede liberation by itself, it is the source of everything that has to be eliminated to reach liberation. This suggests that the ground consciousness is the foundation for samsara, but not for nirvana. When the ground consciousness is eliminated by “the vajra samadhi,” with vajra meaning “indestructible” and samadhi meaning “meditation,” All consciousnesses are transformed into the wisdoms and cease to exist as consciousnesses. So the nature of the ground consciousness is delusion; its nature is not the true nature of reality. When Buddhahood or arhatship is attained, the ground consciousness ends.   The ground consciousness is the true cause for our perception of external phenomena such as mountains and is also the cause of all of our internal phenomena such as thoughts. This is because the ground consciousness is the source of all the illusory 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 72 appearances of samsara. Although its nature is neutral, and it does not impede liberation in itself, it is the source of everything that has to be eliminated.  MIRROR-LIKE WISDOM37  23. When ground consciousness with its obscurations is negated,  At that time, there will be the mirror-like wisdom.  All wisdoms appear in it without the concept of “mine.”  It is unbounded and eternally possessed.  It realizes all that is to be known, without being    directed towards them.  It is described as “the dharmakaya”  Because it is the foundation for all the wisdoms.  The first wisdom is the mirror-like wisdom of the dharmakaya. The eight consciousnesses are transformed into the five wisdoms when a person is about to become a buddha. At the boundary of this transformation there is a final trace of the ground conscious-ness left and that is eliminated by the vajra-like samadhi after which buddhahood is achieved transforming the ground consciousness into mirror-like wisdom.  Since mirror-like wisdom itself is freedom from delusions, it perceives the delusions, experiences, aspirations and interests of others as clearly as if their mind were reflected in a mirror. Ordinarily, we can see only what is in front of us, but mirror-like wisdom enables us to see everything in all directions, without any errors and this leads to a great realization because all aspects are seen so clearly and accurately.  From the luminous clarity of the ground consciousness, external phenomena seem to really appear as external objects. The ground consciousness also gives rise to the internal pheno-mena of the mind and this gives rise to the belief in a self which  37. The complete title is “The Mirror-like Wisdom: the Result of Purification—Kaya and Wisdom.”  
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 73 in turn results in the creation of the disturbing emotions. All these phenomena that come from the ground consciousness appear very vividly to us. When the ground consciousness has been transformed into mirror-like wisdom, there aren’t any clear or vivid delusions and appearances of samsara because luminous clarity becomes mirror-like wisdom. We may wonder if the elimination of the ground consciousness results in an emptiness such as a vacuum of empty space. No, this state is described as a mirror in which a reflection appears vividly, but without any sense of self. There is no grasping or distortion caused by the thought of “I” or “me,” and so everything just appears clearly.  A wisdom may be permanent or it may be impermanent and change. For example, the wisdom of all-accomplishing actions undergoes changes depending on the needs and conditions of sentient beings, whereas mirror-like wisdom is changeless, continuously present, and permanent like the ground conscious-ness. Anything, whether beneficial or harmful, will appear to the mirror-like wisdom accurately, continuously, and impartially without any distinction between self and other.  Mirror-like wisdom is the wisdom of love and compassion; it gives rise to compassion, and that compassion gives rise to the power or wisdom to help others. Unlike the ground consciousness which is the root of all the illusory appearances of samsara, mirror-like wisdom is the source of the five wisdoms and is called “the dharmakaya wisdom” in this verse. The Sanskrit word kaya means “body” or “aspect” and the word Dharma comes from the Sanskrit dhrina, meaning “to hold.” Thus, Dharma literally means “to hold something” so it doesn’t fall down. So we can say that Dharma prevents us from falling into samsara or lower existences. The Sanskrit word Dharma was translated into Tibetan as chö which means “to repair, correct, or heal.” For example, if an error were to occur, we would express correcting it using the word chö. It is also used to describe healing an illness, and to describe situations where everything is going well or prospering. Dharma therefore is 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 74 where all the good qualities are being developed and all the negative things are being eliminated.   THE WISDOM OF EQUALITY  24. The “afflicted mentality”  Is utterly defeated by the “fearless samadhi.”  The disturbing emotions are utterly eliminated on    the paths of insight and meditation.  The subsequent absence of afflictions,   The absence of samsara and nirvana,  Is described as the “wisdom of equality.”  The second wisdom is the wisdom of equality. It is the result of the transformation of the afflicted aspect of the seventh consciousness. This afflicted consciousness possesses subtle ego-clinging until it is transformed, and there is no longer a distinction between self and other or the thought of “I” and “mine.” This trans-formation occurs at the eighth bodhisattva level and is attained through the samadhi of fearlessness whose courage is compared to that of a lion—an animal that cannot be defeated by any of the other animals.  This courageous samadhi or meditation overcomes the dual-istic beliefs of the seventh consciousness. When we are clinging to a belief in a self, everything becomes frightening and we become cowards. Even if a little stone is flicked at us, we instinctively react in fear. This is because we are clinging to a self and are afraid our self will be harmed. This courageous samadhi enables us to overcome the protection of the self performed by the seventh consciousness and to become unafraid of anything or anyone.   Until the eighth bodhisattva level we engage in samadhi which still contains some disturbing emotions. Sometimes the samadhi is stable; at other times disturbing emotions arise and must be eliminated. In any case, they are completely pacified on the eighth bodhisattva level. 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 75  Next we discuss these changes in relation to the sutra Five Paths. On the first Path of Accumulation and the second Path of Junction the disturbing emotions are basically brought under control, but latencies of these disturbing emotions are still present. Consequently, the Path of Junction is the aspiration to eliminate the disturbing emotions. On the third Path of Insight, the true nature of phenomena is realized but it is not enough to eradicate all the disturbing emotions because we need to become familiarized with and then meditate on the true nature of phenomena. On the fourth Path of Meditation, we habituate ourselves to what is gained on the Path of Insight. The fifth Path of No More Learning is complete enlightenment.  The obvious and coarse disturbing emotions are vanquished when the true nature of phenomena is realized on the third Path of Insight. The subtle disturbing emotions, however, are not eliminated until the fourth Path of Meditation. For example, when we see something we are attracted to, an attachment and craving to it will arise. And when that attachment and craving have been eliminated, everything is seen impartially, with a realization of the equality of all things. This also applies to the disturbing emotion of anger because anger is the wanting to eliminate something that is unpleasant. Eliminating the resulting aggression allows everything to be seen impartially. Similarly, pride creates a biased opinion and when it is eliminated all beings are thought of impartially. Also the disturbing emotion of ignorance accompanies the other disturbing emotions so that when desire, anger, pride and so on are eliminated, all phenomena are realized to be equal and a state of equality and peace are established.  On the third Path of Seeing there is the gradual elimination of the disturbing emotions and this process lasts throughout the Path of Meditation with the disturbing emotions gradually decreasing and the wisdoms gradually increasing. When the seventh afflicted consciousness is completely vanquished on the eighth bodhisattva level, the last of the disturbing emotions are also vanquished and the complete wisdom of equality is attained. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 76  The conceptual aspects of the afflicted consciousness are eliminated by realizing the true nature of phenomena on the Path of Insight, while the subtle, inherent aspects of this conscious-ness are eliminated on the next Path of Meditation which corre-sponds to the tenth bodhisattva level. As long as we have disturbing emotions and an attachment to a self, there is dualistic thinking of good and bad, self and other that results in many different kinds of suffering. For example, if we think of ourselves as being better than others, our pride will increase and when we see others who are doing better than we are, we develop envy and jealousy. However, when the disturbing emotions are eliminated, the wisdom of equality is attained with everything appearing to us as impartial and pure with no differentiation of good or bad, enemies or friends, and so forth.  DISCRIMINATING WISDOM: THE PURIFIER AND PURIFIED  25a. The immediate mentality  Is called “the sustainer” because it sustains the six    consciousnesses.  It is called “thought” because it gives rise to thoughts.  It is defeated by true understanding and the   “illusion-samadhi.”   The seventh consciousness has two aspects: the afflicted and the immediate mind. As previously mentioned, the afflicted mind is transformed into the wisdom of equality at the eighth bodhisattva level. However, the immediate mind is transformed into the discriminating wisdom at enlightenment.  Discriminating wisdom is related to the five sensory con-sciousnesses and the sixth mental consciousness. The discrimen-ation of our experiences is caused by the six consciousnesses––whether they arise from one of the five sense consciousnesses or from the mental consciousness. This discriminating wisdom knows each thing just as it really is and is called “discriminating wisdom” because all experiences of the six consciousnesses are perceived or “discriminated” as they truly are. 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 77  The immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness is involved in the sustaining of the continual arising and cessation of the six sensory consciousnesses and is therefore known as “the sustainer” in this verse. Since it also gives rise to thoughts, it is also called “thought.” As these thoughts can only be deluded because their true nature is not realized, they can be eliminated only by true understanding and by the illusion-samadhi. True understanding realizes the impermanence, suffering, and the emptiness of phenomena. The illusion-samadhi is the knowledge that the mind and all its thoughts are illusions, there-fore this realization of emptiness is able to arise.  DISCRIMINATING WISDOM: THE RESULT OF PURIFICATION  25b. When “‘the great patience” is attained   Due to the transformation of perceptions and perceiver  There is a manifestation of pure realms,  The wisdom of all times,  And total, unimpeded activity.  The thoughts involved in these, transformed;  Become “discriminating wisdom.”  The “great patience,” also called the “great equality,” is the complete and thorough achievement of the perfection of patience which is attained at the eighth bodhisattva level. At this stage, the perceiver and what is perceived are transformed so that one can actually enter into the pure realm and can also manifest pure realms to others. At the ninth bodhisattva level, the thoughts of the eighth bodhisattva level are transformed into the unimpeded wisdom of all times, meaning the wisdom of the past, present, and future. Finally, at the tenth bodhisattva level, thoughts are transformed into an unimpeded engagement with all the kinds of activities required to train beings to reach complete realization. The ultimate transformation of all our thoughts into the discriminating wisdom occurs at the level of Buddhahood which some systems place at the tenth level and 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 78 others place at the thirteenth level.38 It is discriminating wisdom that knows all that is to be known, exactly it is, distinctly, and individually.  To summarize, ground consciousness is transformed into the mirror-like wisdom. The afflicted aspect of the seventh consciousness is transformed into the wisdom of equality. The immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness is transformed into discriminating wisdom. The sambhogakaya possesses two wisdoms: the wisdom of equality and discriminating wisdom. The immediate aspect of the seventh consciousness is transformed into discriminating wisdom. THE SAMBHOGAKAYA  26. These two wisdoms of equality and discrimination are  Pure meditation, through which there is no   abiding in samsara and nirvana;  The possession of peace, love, and compassion;  The manifestation of various bodies;  And teachings to the retinues.  The mandala of the melody of the great Dharma is manifest  And is a treasury of all samadhis and dharanis.  This is named the sambhogakaya.   This verse describes the sambhogakaya in relation to the five wisdoms. The Sanskrit word, sambhogakaya, literally means the “body of perfect or complete enjoyment” and was translated into Tibetan as long chö dzok ku. The syllables long chö means “enjoyment” or “pleasures,” and dzok pa means “complete,” and ku means “body.” To understand the meaning of this word, we must ask, “What pleasures does a buddha have?” The sambhogakaya form of the buddha teaches the Dharma to bodhisattvas who have already transcended suffering by  38. The Mahayana usually describe the bodhisattva path as having ten levels and the Vajrayana usually describe three more levels making thirteen levels. 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 79 attaining the bodhisattva levels. A buddha experiences pleasure thinking that he or she has been able to benefit these beings and will not be worried about sliding back into suffering. The activity of a buddha is perfected in the sambhogakaya where a buddha is able to give the perfect wisdom, meditation, and activity to the bodhisattvas. Consequently, all the pleasures of the bodhisattvas are derived from the sambhogakaya.  The essence of the sambhogakaya is the wisdom of equality and the wisdom of discrimination. The wisdom of equality allows the buddhas to see all sentient beings without prejudice, without thinking, “this sentient being is more worthy of enlightenment than that sentient being.” This wisdom gives rise to great compassion. Discriminating wisdom allows the buddhas to see everything as it actually is, completely and without any mistakes, so that they can engage in flawless buddha activity. We can contrast the sambhogakaya with the nirmanakaya which is the kaya that we live in now.  There are five characteristics of the sambhogakaya. First, it contains a definite retinue that is entirely made up of bodhis-attvas who have attained the ten bodhisattva levels. In the nirmanakaya, however, a buddha is surrounded by pupils who have differing diligence, with differing devotion, and differing faith. Second, a nirmanakaya buddha sometimes manifests in a pure realm, and sometimes in an impure realm, whereas a sambhogakaya buddha can only be encountered in a pure realm. Third, there is a certain time that a nirmanakaya buddha and his teachings are given in the world whereas a sambhogakaya buddha and their teachings continue without interruption and exist until samsara ends. Fourth, the teachings in the sambhogakaya are exclusively of the Mahayana Dharma. A nirmanakaya buddha, on the other hand, has pupils at different levels of understanding and introduces them to the Dharma by teaching the definitive teachings to some and the provisional teachings to others. Fifth, the sambhogakaya buddha has an enlightened body. The nirmanakaya buddha possesses the special features of a buddha and has the appearance of being 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 80 made of flesh and bones, but his body is composed of physical material. Whereas, the sambhogakaya buddha has a completely pure body possessing all the distinctive physical marks of a buddha and is immaterial.   The discriminating wisdom and the wisdom of equality of the sambhogakaya buddha arise from the pure meditation which is beyond samsara and nirvana. The wisdom of equality leads to a great peace; love, and compassion for others. The wisdom of discrimination leads to the manifestation of the sambhogakaya deities who reside in the pure realms. For example, the Amitabha buddha  resides in the pure realm of Tushita. In these pure realms, it is said that one hears the continuous teachings of the Dharma, or as the verse says, “the great Dharma melody” which is in the mandala of the pure realm. What is in the mandala of the pure realm? There we find all the teachings of the samadhi (meditation) and the dharani.   THE ALL-ACCOMPLISHING WISDOM  27. The transformation of the five sensory consciousnesses   And the aspect of the mental consciousness are directed   towards these:  The sixteen wisdoms of the “patience for knowledge”  And the aspects of the four truths,  That have arisen from correct thought,  See and truly realize the meaning.  The all-accomplishing wisdom is associated with achieving all the goals of the Dharma and particularly eliminating hindrances such as illness and other material obstacles.  The path or map to enlightenment may be described in two ways––in terms of the ten bodhisattva levels and in terms of the Five Paths.39 The Five Paths are the Path of Accumulation where we accumulate vast merit and wisdom; the Path of Junction where we are preparing to realize emptiness; the Path of Insight  39. A chart of the Five Paths is given on page 34. 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 81 where emptiness is first truly realized and becomes the beginning of the ten bodhisattva levels; the Path of Meditation where we develop extremely precise and refined meditation; and the Path of No-more-learning which is enlightenment.   The Pramana teachings on logic state that the mental con-sciousness has two aspects: the conceptual and the nonconcept-ual aspects. The five sensory consciousnesses and the nonconceptual aspect of the sixth (mental) consciousness are all impure and are transformed into the pure all-accomplishing wisdom through what is called correct thought or examination. Correct examination has the aspiration to engage in true meditation on the second Path of Junction. Meditating with that aspiration gives rise to wisdom of the third Path of Insight and the wisdom that realizes the nature of the Four Noble Truths––the truth of suffering, the truth of origination, the truth of cessation, and the truth of the path. These truths each have the aspect of samsara and nirvana and cause and effect. Samsara is caused by suffering, namely the disturbing emotions and karma which are described in the first Noble Truth of origination. When the disturbing emotions and karma are eliminated, the result is peace and liberation, or “nirvana” which is described in the third Noble Truth. The cause of nirvana is the application of the eight-fold path which is the fourth Noble Truth.  Each of the Four Noble Truths has four levels of under-standing: first, an individual having no true understanding but the willingness to learn the Dharma; second, having actual understanding; third the thorough attainment of the first bodhi-sattva level; and fourth attaining complete liberation by having eliminated the disturbing emotions. These four aspects times the four Noble Truths are called the sixteen aspects of the Four Noble Truths on the third Path of Insight.40  For example, the first Noble Truth on the origin of sentient beings’ suffering has first the aspect which is the obscuration of the nature of suffering, the elimination of which results in the  40. See the glossary for these sixteen aspects under “sixteen aspects.”  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 82 equanimity that understands the nature of suffering; second, the  aspect of having eliminated the fist aspect, the nature of suffering is seen resulting in the knowledge of suffering; third the aspect of having achieved the outcome of attaining the first two aspects which is equanimity and a subsequent understanding of suffering; and fourth, the aspect of the outcome of attaining all three aspects which is the subsequent knowledge of the nature of suffering. When this first noble truth is completely realized; the elimination of all these obstructions to the truth of suffering is reached which is called “the patience for the knowledge of the phenomena of suffering.”   28. The five sensory consciousnesses are transformed when:  There is an engagement with all sensory objects  And the power and possession of the twelve qualities  Of all the bodhisattva levels develop a hundred-fold.  When this is developed to the fullest extent,  It becomes the wisdom of accomplishment.  Our senses and their corresponding sensory consciousnesses are very limited. For example, when we are inside a room, our senses can tell us what is going on in the room, but not what is going on outside the room. Also when we look at an individual we don’t know what are the  individual’s wishes and desires. However, upon reaching the Path of Insight, our senses and their corresponding consciousnesses are transformed into all-accom-plishing wisdom. When this wisdom is attained, we can see the true nature of phenomena and we can perceive the nature of other individuals: their state of mind, their aspirations, their capabilities, and also what activity is necessary to teach them.  This wisdom is attained on the first bodhisattva level called “complete joy.” At this point we attain twelve qualities and each quality has a hundred more qualities. Some of these twelve qualities are: seeing a hundred buddhas in one instant; receiving the teachings of a hundred buddhas in one instant; manifesting a hundred emanations in one instant; and so on. On the second bodhisattva level, these twelve qualities increase a thousand-
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 83 fold. At the third level, they are multiplied a hundred thousand-fold, and so on with their benefit increasing until we reach the level of Buddhahood and fully attain the wisdom of accom-plishment. This wisdom is attained on the first bodhisattva level, but it is not complete because the wisdom of accomplishment came from the nirmanakaya form of the Buddha. So the full nirmanakaya wisdom is not obtained until the complete state of Buddhahood. With this wisdom of accomplishment, a buddha completely knows the true nature of phenomena, the nature of his or her pupils, and the necessary methods required for them to reach enlightenment. At this point, the buddha can effortlessly benefit all beings.  THE FOUR TYPES OF NIRMANAKAYA  29. This wisdom accomplishes benefit for all beings  Through an incalculable, inconceivable,   variety of emanations through all realms.  This is the supreme Nirmanakaya.  Although the twelve deeds41 are the principal means by which the “supreme nirmanakaya” (another name for the Buddha) leads sentient beings into the Dharma, the Buddha through his clairvoyance knew what specific individuals needed. Some needed to witness miracles to gain faith and enter the Dharma, therefore the Buddha sent them to Maudgalyayana, one of his principal pupils, to display miracles for them. There were others who were not convinced by miracles but were convinced by logic and reasoning, so he sent Shariputra, who excelled in wisdom, to teach them. Those who were not convinced by either miracles or wisdom, but were impressed by the excellent restrained conduct of his ordained sangha, he sent Upali, a monk with excellent conduct who inspired faith in them. Some would benefit from the Dharma being taught to them, so the Buddha  41. These are the traditional summary of the Buddha’s life. See Chart on page 48 for a list of these twelve deeds. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 84 himself would  lead them into the Dharma with teachings. If persons couldn’t be brought into the Dharma by the various methods of the supreme nirmanakaya, the Buddha was able to use the created nirmanakaya, which is created for a certain situation, unlike the supreme nirmanakaya that is born, practices meditation, and achieves Buddhahood through the path.   The wisdom of accomplishment is the wisdom that regulates Buddha activity. The supreme nirmanakaya, the Shakyamuni Buddha, accomplished the twelve deeds through the wisdom of accomplishment. The wisdom of accomplishment makes it possible that whatever needs to be done, can be done. This ability can only be attained after all the ignorance of the five sensory consciousnesses have been transformed. By this point, whatever needs to be done to benefit oneself or others can be done without any error or mistake. The Buddha is able to  understand all things through omniscience.   There are four different kinds of emanation or nirmanakaya manifestations: supreme nirmanakaya, the created nirmanakaya, the born nirmanakaya, and the various nirmanakaya. The supreme nirmanakaya is the Shakyamuni Buddha who appeared in the world and performed the activities that are summarized in the twelve deeds of the Buddha. The Buddha was in the Tushita pure realm before he entered the womb of his mother to be born into our world to help all sentient beings. He was born in a grove in Lumbini in Nepal and later inherited his father’s kingdom by becoming a prince, marrying a princess, and having a child. He could just as well have descended from Tushita and been born in a flower (as was Padmasambhava) but there was a reason that he did not. If he had been miraculously born, people would have thought, “It is possible that he achieved enlightenment because of his miraculous birth, whereas I am born of an ordinary mother, and therefore cannot attain enlightenment?” If he had not been a prince, and had not married, people would have thought, “Being an ascetic is different. I am incapable of becoming ordained and leading a wandering life.” However, the Buddha, in his nirmanakaya form; was born in Lumbini, reached 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 85 Buddhahood at Bodhgaya, and gave his first Dharma teachings at Varanasi. For the rest of his life he taught beings with teachings suited for their abilities.   The created nirmanakaya is not born of parents, but instead manifests for particular beneficial situations. An example of this is the story of Panada, the king of the gandharvas, who are the celestial musicians. He played the vina which is an Indian lute. One day Indra, the king of Indian deities, came to him and said, “The Buddha is now in the world and is giving Dharma teachings so let’s go!” Panada answered, “No, I prefer to practice my vina. You go and enjoy it.” Later Indra returned and told Panada, “The Buddha is half way through his life. Why don’t you listen to the Dharma teachings with me?” Panada replied, “I will continue practicing my vina. You go.” Once more Indra returned and said, “The Buddha is ready to pass away. You had better come now,” but Panada preferred playing his lute.  To break Panada’s attachment and pride, the Buddha manifested as an Indian lute player carrying a lute made completely of lapis lazuli. As he passed by the kingdom of the gandharvas, Panada heard him playing by the palace gate and feeling jealous, said, “Let’s compete to see who is the best.” They sat down and both played perfectly. Then the Buddha said, “Let’s cut one of the strings and then see who plays the best.” They played equally well and began cutting more and more strings. When all the strings had been cut, the Buddha’s emanation continued playing beautifully, while Panada could not play. His pride was broken and he asked, “Where did you learn to play like that?” The Buddha answered, “If you listen to the Dharma teachings of the Buddha, you will be able to play like this too.” And so Panada hurried off to receive the Dharma teachings.   The third kind of nirmanakaya, the born nirmanakaya, is unlike the supreme and created nirmanakaya in that it has a body and can take birth not only as a human, but sometimes as an animal. This kind of nirmanakaya does not just teach the 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 86 Dharma, but through their activity or behavior they benefit sentient beings as, for example, the Jakata sutras that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha and the Buddha was an animal in some of his previous lifetimes.   Finally, there is the fourth or “various” types of nirmanakaya beings called tulkus in Tibetan  who are not supreme nirmana-kayas. For example, the First Karmapa, Dusum Khyenpa, when he was at the end of his life, asked his students to look after his three centers at Tsurphu, Kamaga, Kampogangara. He told them that he would be reborn and come back and look after these places. Karma Pakshi, who was born several years after Dusum Khyenpa died, told everyone that he was the Karmapa. Since he had many miraculous powers, such as clairvoyance, there was no doubt that he was the second Karmapa. His pupils were very happy and his return helped them to continue practicing the Dharma. Consequently, when other lamas passed away in Tibet, their students would go to high lamas and say, “We want our lama to return to us like the Karmapa returned.” In response to these requests, high lamas used their clairvoyant powers to discover where the lama had been reborn thus helping the students to practice the Dharma. Some tulkus can predict their own birth, as the Karmapa has done now sixteen times, while other tulkus are recognized by other lamas.  Eventually, there were numerous tulkus in Tibet. Some of them had bad behavior and others were unintelligent which made some Tibetans wonder whether there was really anything special about tulkus. The tulku may have practiced very diligently and led a very pure life so that he would be recognized lifetime after lifetime. However, sometimes a tulku practiced so purely that he or she achieved complete enlightenment and entered into a pure realm. The tulku’s pupils, not knowing this, would go to the Karmapa and ask him to help find the reincarnation and the Karmapa couldn’t say, “He won’t come back.” Instead, the Karmapa would say something like, “Well, maybe this child could be him and it will be beneficial if you choose him.” Believing the child was the tulku, the students 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 87 would find the child, give them training, and they would grow and benefit many beings.  So before the time of the First Karmapa, the use of the word “nirmanakaya” for tulku was not used. But from this time on there have been many tulkus and these make up the fourth various types of nirmanakaya.   I have a personal experience of this. I am called the Thrangu Tulku. When I first gave this some thought, I was perplexed. I thought, “Well, I know that I’m not Thrangu Tulku but the Karmapa said that I am! The Karmapa knew my father’s name and mother’s name, even though I was born far away and he didn’t know my family.” I thought about this a lot and felt that it was all very strange. So one day I asked my khenpo (tutor), “I know I’m not the Thrangu Tulku but I’ve been declared to be him. Why? Perhaps the real one will turn up some day.” The khenpo said that there definitely wouldn’t be anyone else claiming the be the Thrangu Tulku, that I knew what my own mind was like, and if I was certain I wasn’t a tulku, then I wasn’t one!   This left me wondering, “What does all this mean?” until finally I understood. The Karmapa had given me the name of Thrangu Tulku because it would be very beneficial for me. Otherwise, I would have either become a merchant like my father or worked in the fields like my mother. Having been recognized as Thrangu Tulku, I became a monk, received teachings from many lamas, and had the opportunity to practice the Dharma. So the Karmapa didn’t declare me to be Thrangu Tulku because I was the actual tulku, but did so in order for me to carry on the work of the Thrangu Tulkus which is what I am now doing.   So we should understand that there is the supreme nirmana-kaya, the created nirmanakayas, and the born nirmanakayas, and in the tulku tradition of Tibet, there are various nirmanakayas which include superior tulkus, inferior tulkus, and finally counterfeit tulkus like myself!  THE DHARMADHATU WISDOM AS THE SVABHAVIKAKAYA 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 88  30. Thus mind (sem), mentality (yi), and sensory   Consciousnesses (namshe) are transformed   Into the three kayas and their activity.  They are completely present within the mandala    of the complication-free dharmadhatu,  Without samsara, nirvana, or beginning,  Without being single or multiple.  This is called “the essence kaya”(svabhavikakaya).  The origin of all the kayas, which we have been discussing, is the dharmakaya, more specifically, the aspect of the dharmakaya which is free from all mental fabrications called the svabhavi-kakaya. In the previous verses Rangjung Dorje has used three terms for mind rather interchangeably: namshe (consciousness) to refer to the eight consciousnesses, yi (mentality) and sem (mind). In this verse, however, he uses sem for the eighth con-sciousness, yi for the seventh consciousness, and namshe for the six consciousnesses.   The eighth consciousnesses are transformed into the three kayas: the eighth or ground consciousness becomes the dharmakaya, the seventh afflicted and immediate consciousness becomes the sambhogakaya, and the other six consciousnesses become the nirmanakaya except for the conceptual aspect of the sixth conscious-ness which becomes the svabhavikakaya. Each kaya possesses specific activities: the sambhogakaya assists pure beings to reach the ultimate achievement of Buddhahood; the nirmanakaya assists impure beings according to their capacities, and the dharmakaya has the wisdom and love that is the root of all three kayas. Thus, all their activities ultimately derive from the dharmakaya.  Although the dharmakaya is the source of the two wisdoms of the Buddha (the wisdom of the true nature of phenomena (Tib. ji ta ba) and the wisdom of the variety of phenomena (Tib. ji nye pa), has love for all beings, and has the power of the Buddha’s mind, it has no true reality. The dharmakaya is empty; its nature is the dharmadhatu and it is free of mental fabrications. 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 89 Although the sambhogakaya manifests a form with the 32 major and the 80 secondary signs of a buddha,42 that manifestation has no true reality and is empty in nature. The nirmanakaya, although it acts to benefit beings, has a nature that is inseparable from the dharmadhatu.  All three of the kayas are beyond conceptual extremes. The dharmakaya is the dharmadhatu and is beyond any conceptual elaboration. Although the sambhogakaya only manifests to bodhi-sattvas, its essence is also beyond mental elaborations and therefore is also the dharmadhatu. Although the nirmanakaya manifests in the form of the Shakyamuni Buddha to impure beings,  its essence is also beyond any mental elaborations and is therefore the dharmadhatu. For this reason all the kayas are undifferentiated in the great mandala of the dharmadhatu which is called the “essence-kaya” or the “svabhavikakaya.” The two aspects concerning realization of the true nature of phenomena are the svabhavikakaya and the dharmakaya with the svabha-vikakaya being the aspect of emptiness and the dharmakaya being the aspect of luminous clarity.  Shantideva (675-725 CE) said that because he taught that all phenomena are empty, some people replied, “If all phenomena are empty, then the Buddha is empty too, so making offerings to the Buddha will not accumulate any merit.” However, Shantideva replied that the Buddha indeed has no solid reality. Just like in a dream when an illusory offering is made to an illusory Buddha; this process will still result in illusory merit, just as real merit would have arisen from real offerings to a real Buddha.”  The three kayas have an empty essence and this emptiness is called the dharmadhatu. The dharmadhatu is itself one the five wisdoms. This dharmadhatu wisdom is the absence of any inherent essence or reality. The Sanskrit word “dharmadhatu” was translated into Tibetan as chö ying in which ying (Skt.  42. The 32 major and 80 secondary marks are all listed in Wikipedia under “physical characteristics of a buddha.” 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 90 dhatu) means “the expanse of space.” Space43 is empty and has the quality of providing room so that without space we could not move. Space allows us to walk, sit, or do any activity. It is combined with chö which is “dharma” so the dharmadhatu is “the space that enables Dharma to happen.”   Because the disturbing emotions are pervaded by the dharmadhatu, they don’t have any solid reality which means it is possible then that they can be eliminated. If they were  solid and truly real, then we couldn’t get rid of them. We can develop the positive qualities of love and wisdom  because these also are pervaded by the dharmadhatu. If they truly existed, then we wouldn’t be able to change them. So, we are able to reduce our negative qualities and increase our positive qualities because phenomena lack any true reality and are pervaded by dharma-dhatu. That is why these eight consciousnesses can be transformed into the five wisdoms: because their nature is the dharmadhatu.  Many names are given to the dharmadhatu. In the Foundation Vehicle it is called the “egolessness or selflessness of the individual.” In the Mahayana it is called “emptiness.,” But the actual characteristics of the dharmadhatu are explained in the Shentong school.44 The Shentong tradition describes both the characteristics and the essence of the dharmadhatu. The word “emptiness” (Skt. shunyata) does not mean simply a dead vacuum. Rather, in the Shentong teachings, the nature of emptiness is taught to be luminous clarity. Because of the power of this luminous clarity, dharmadhatu was given the name “the essence of the Tathagata” or tathagata-garba (Skt. tathagata is  43. The fifth element is translated as “space” because it supports everything else. It is more like the concept of the fifth element (after earth, water, fire, air) of ether in Aristotelian logic rather than simply space. In the West the concept of ether was proven not to exist in 1881 by Michelson and Morley. 44. Thrangu Rinpoche is one of the foremost scholars of the Shentong tradition, as was Jamgon Kongtrul, and Rangjung Dorje before him. 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 91 “buddha” and garba is “nature”). Therefore, dharmadhatu is often called “buddha nature.”  All sentient beings possess buddha nature, yet they are unable to realize the true nature of phenomena. This is because their dharmadhatu wisdom is covered by two obscurations: cognitive obscurations (not realizing the true nature of phenomena) and emotional obscurations (the disturbing emotions). Just as the sky becomes clear when the clouds have disappeared, the wisdom of dharmadhatu appears when the disturbing emotions have been removed. Due to the five wisdoms (mirror-like wisdom, wisdom of equality, all-accomplishing wisdom, discriminating wisdom, and dharmadhatu wisdom), the realization of the true nature of appearances is possible.  We cannot separate the eight consciousnesses from the dharmadhatu. The nature of the dharmadhatu is the eight con-sciousnesses and the nature of the eight consciousnesses is the dharmadhatu. This is also true for the two wisdoms of the Buddha which are also imbued with the dharmadhatu wisdom. In Vajrayana meditation this is experienced not by meditating on the emptiness of external appearances, but on meditating on the actual nature of the mind by looking  directly at the mind.  For example, if we look at something, we obviously see its appearance in our mind. Yet when we try to locate the visual consciousness that is dong the looking, we can’t locate it. This is because the nature of the visual consciousness is empty and inseparable from dharmadhatu so we call this “the inseparability of luminous clarity and emptiness.” All the consciousnesses are completely pervaded by dharmadhatu meaning their nature is also emptiness. The reason we can’t find these consciousnesses is that their nature is insubstantial and constantly changing. In the Vajrayana tradition, looking directly at mind is the way we gain the recognition of the empty nature of the mind.   We have been classifying and dividing these eight consciousnesses using deduction and reasoning; but we cannot actually isolate each consciousness and see them individually because they are the indivisibility of luminous clarity and 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 92 emptiness. This emptiness, however, is not a complete voidness, because luminous clarity is also present. Therefore the process of mind seeing itself is this realization of emptiness. The mental consciousness can allow things to arise in the mind, but the mental consciousness is inseparable from the dharmadhatu. When these consciousnesses are transformed into the wisdoms, the unity of wisdom and space is inseparable.   The four wisdoms that have already been described are therefore pervaded by the dharmadhatu which is free of mental fabrications. The dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya are not new creations. They have always been there. It is this nature which the eight consciousnesses are transformed into that is known as the dharmadhatu wisdom. This dharmadhatu wisdom is also a kaya: it is the svabhavikakaya or “essence-kaya.” The svabhavikakaya, like the dharmadhatu wisdom, is the absence of solid existence that provides space for the other three kayas to occur. That is the nature of the three kayas and why they are also called the essence kayas. Thus Rangjung Dorje says, “multiple or single, this is called the essence kaya.”  OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE WISDOMS AND THE KAYAS  31. In some other texts, the Victorious One  Teaches this to be the dharmakaya.  The mirror-wisdom is then described as the “wisdom kaya”   And the other wisdoms as the two “form kayas.”  This section was written to clear away any doubts practitioners might have. According to the capacities of beings, the Buddha explained the kayas in various ways. Sometimes he taught only three kayas, leaving out the svabhavikakaya which was subsumed within the dharmakaya. Other times he taught only the four wisdoms not mentioning the dharmadhatu wisdom at all. On occasion, when appropriate, he taught that the dharmadhatu wisdom, the dharmakaya, and mirror-like wisdom were part of a wisdom kaya called the “jnana kaya.” Sometimes he taught that the wisdoms of equality, discriminating wisdom, and all-accomplishing wisdom were part of the form kayas 
The Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdoms 
 93 called the rupakaya, which comprises the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya.  In other sutras and texts, the essence-kaya was sometimes referred as the dharmakaya since the dharmadhatu is the source of all the qualities of our own realization and the ability to help other beings. Therefore the dharmadhatu wisdom was given the name the dharmakaya.   Briefly, the mirror-like wisdom was sometimes called the wisdom kaya. Because it has the aspect of luminous clarity, the dharmadhatu is sometimes called the dharmakaya. The three wisdoms of equality, discriminating wisdom, and wisdom of all-accomplishment are almost always associated with the two form kayas (the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya). 
 94  The Eighteen Elements or Constituents of Mind  (Skt. dhatu, Tib. khams)  The six outer objects: 1. visual forms rupa dhatu 2. sounds  shabda dhatu 3. smells  gandha dhatu 4. tastes   rasa dhatu 5. objects of touch sparsha dhatu 6. mental phenomena dharma dhatu  The six sense organs: 1. eye sense organ chakshur dhatu 2. ear sense organ shrota dhatu 3. nose sense organ ghrane dhatu 4. tongue sense organ jihva dhatu 5. body sense organ kaya dhatu 6. mind sense organ mano dhatu  The eight consciousnesses: 1. eye consciousness chakshur vihnanadhatu 2. ear consciousness shrotra vihnanadhatu 3. nose consciousness ghrana vihnanadhatu 4. tongue conscious. Jihva vihnanadhatu 5. body consciousness kaya vihnanadhatu 6. mental conscious. Mano vihnanadhatu  The 18 elements describe how information from the external world is processed within the mind using 18 different processes. For example, we might see a dog. This is a external visual object. The image of a dog would then enter the sense organ of the eye. This raw information would then go to the eye consciousness (in the brain) and be converted into information that our mind could then process using the sixth mental consciousness where it would be recognized as “Oh, this is my dog.” Because it is combined with past experiences.  
 95  6  A Summary of the Treatise  This chapter follows a tradition which originated at the great University of Nalanda. When the great panditas of Nalanda wrote commentaries, they described the different ways of relating to the Buddha’s teachings. They proposed a method of presenting the subject in a brief summary that was called “the leap of a tiger.” Another method consisting of giving every detail of a teaching word by word which was called “the crawl of a turtle.” There was also a third method of presenting a brief summary of the entire explanation called “the lion returning.” This text has been taught according to the crawling turtle method. However, this summary of the treatise uses the lion returning method.  SUMMARY OF THE WISDOMS AND KAYAS  32. Buddhahood is the manifestation of the nature  Of the five wisdoms and four kayas.  When the eight consciousness are transformed into the five wisdoms and the four kayas, we become buddhas. Whichever terms are used, there are four kayas: the dharmakaya, sambho-gakaya, nirmanakaya, and svabhavikakaya.   THE TRANSFORMATION OF IMPURE TO PURE  33. That which possesses the stains of the mind, mentality,    and consciousness  Is described as the ground consciousness.  That which is stainless, is the buddha nature.  
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 96 Without the transformation of impure into pure, we are an ordinary being. As an ordinary being we have the three aspects of mind, mentality, and consciousness described in verse 30 that are stained by samsara. The ground consciousness is the basis of all samsara. The disturbing emotions are also a part of the consciousnesses which have been described as being impure. The mind also has a pure aspect. This pure, stainless aspect of mind is buddha nature.  34. The Buddha has taught that the truth of the path  Is the possession of the power of the Noble Ones,  That is born from the pure conceptualization,  And that defeats impure thoughts.  We may ask how we actually transform the eight conscious-nesses into the five wisdoms while we are on the path. The answer is we should cultivate pure thoughts which will then automatically defeat impure thoughts. By transforming the eight consciousnesses into the five wisdoms we will then understand the true nature of phenomena.   In a previous life of the Buddha, there was a buddha who was also called Shakyamuni Buddha. There was a poor Brahmin who, when he met this previous Shakyamuni Buddha, felt great faith in him and wanted to make a connection. So he made an offering of rice soup even though he didn’t have a very nice bowl to put it in. He poured the soup into Shakyamuni’s begging bowl and the Buddha drank it and was very pleased. Afterwards, the poor brahmin made an aspirational prayer to become just like that Shakyamuni Buddha––to have the exact same body, to teach the same doctrine, and to have the same name. In the future this prayer was fulfilled and this brahmin did become the Shakyamuni Buddha demonstrating the necessity of having very pure thoughts and pure motivation on the path.  This transformation happens through the Five Paths. First we develop trust and conviction in the Buddha’s teachings and enter the path. At this first level of the Path of Accumulation of wisdom and merit, we begin to understand what the Four Noble 
A Summary of the Treatise 
 97 Truths are and how we can work with our consciousnesses. On the second Path of Junction we receive the teachings, contemplate them, and begin to meditate upon them. By the third Path of Insight our meditation becomes very pure and we actually perceive, for the first time, the true nature of phenomena. This begins the work of “the truth of the path,” which are the ten bodhisattva levels. We follow the Noble Ones (Skt. aryas) who have realized emptiness. From this ultimate wisdom of emptiness arises and allows us to thoroughly understand the nature of phenomena.  THE REASON  THIS TEXT WAS WRITTEN  35. The ignorant wander into the ocean of samsara  Because they have not realized this ultimate nature.  Without the boat of the Mahayana,  How could the other shore ever be reached?  Rangjung Dorje concludes this teaching by giving the reason for why he wrote this text. He says we are presently in a state of delusion; ignorance, and darkness. What we need to do is eliminate this ignorance and lack of understanding by trans-forming our eight consciousnesses into the five wisdoms. If we don’t understand the eight consciousnesses and the five wisdoms, we won’t know how to be on the path that we have to practice to attain our goal. So we will continue to wander in samsara. The Tibetan word for samsara is khorwa which means “to go around,” and indicates that in samsara things sometimes are good and sometimes bad, sometimes the disturbing emotions become weak and sometimes they are very strong. Samsara is just a continuous cycle of happiness and suffering.   Samsara is described by the Buddha as being like an ocean because an ocean is very vast and deep and very dangerous. In the time of the Buddha there weren’t the modern boats that we have now and the only way of traveling on the oceans was in sailboats. Voyages took a very long time and it was easy for boats to sink and for all the passengers to drown. Beings wander 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 98 on the ocean of samsara because they have not realized the ultimate nature of phenomena nor the ultimate nature of their minds. Crossing an ocean safely requires a great boat. This great vehicle is the Mahayana path. If we can practice the Mahayana, we will be able to cross this ocean of samsara. There is actually no other means of doing so.  Rangjung Dorje describes his motivation by explaining that he wrote the Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom to explain the eight consciousnesses and how they are obscured. But since these consciousnesses can ultimately be transformed into the five wisdoms, he describes these wisdoms. Without understanding the eight consciousnesses and their transformation into the five wisdoms, the practitioner will remain in a state of darkness and will not be able to attain freedom from samsara.   Both happiness and suffering are experienced in samsara. Samsara is compared to a bee locked inside a pot. The bee sometimes flies to the top and is stopped by the lid and since there is nowhere to go, it flies to the bottom again––repeating this pattern again and again. That is really what samsara is like. When sentient beings are in mental darkness, they wander around in samsara’s ocean of misery. Rangjung Dorje writes that we need to be free of ignorance. We need to understand the teachings, to contemplate them, and to meditate on them. By doing this we will free ourselves from ignorance and be able to cross the ocean of samsara. Consequently, he wrote this text so that others would understand the nature of their existence and be liberated from ignorance. He then concludes with the aspirational prayer which follows.  THE CONCLUDING PRAYER  We need both freedom from the delusions of relative reality and the understanding of ultimate reality. If we meditate on our mind, we will directly experience its empty nature and its luminous clarity. The realization of the true nature of mind is the 
A Summary of the Treatise 
 99 direct path of the Vajrayana. Before we engage on this direct path, we must understand the difference between the various consciousnesses and wisdoms. This text does not discuss the Mahayana nor Vajrayana meditation practices. It also does not discuss the Mahayana methods of proving the emptiness of all phenomena. The Mahayana sutras clarify the nature of the mind in terms of appearances arising in the mind and the empty nature of these appearances; this is taught in this text. The Vajrayana view of understanding the mind itself is also presented in the text. Therefore Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom is essential for understanding the Mahayana view as well as under-standing Vajrayana practice. Rangjung Dorje then concludes with the aspirational prayer:  36. May this meaning be realized by everyone!  May everyone realize the meaning of this text.  May they understand by hearing the teachings.  May they develop conviction through contemplation,  and then be able to realize the meaning of the   Lord  Buddha’s teachings through meditation.  HOW THIS TREATISE WAS COMPOSED  The Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness and Wisdom was composed in the retreat center Dechen Teng by Rangjung Dorje on the first day of the tenth lunar month of the year of the pig [year 1323].  This treatise was composed by Rangjung Dorje, the Third Karmapa. Every Karmapa has his own special kind of activity to benefit his pupils. The First Karmapa excelled in meditation and established the monastic seats of the future Karmapas. The Second Karmapa had very powerful and frightening miraculous powers. The Fourth  and Fifth Karmapa had great worldly might and power. The Eighth Karmapa, in contrast, was uninvolved with worldly life and lived a simple life dedicated to meditation.  Rangjung Dorje, the Third Karmapa, was renowned as a great scholar of the sutras and the tantras. He had such great 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 100 compassion, that when he passed away on the fourteenth day of the sixth lunar month in China, his face appeared the next day on the full moon. This was seen in Tibet as well as China. It gave rise to the tradition of painting Rangjung Dorje’s image in a full moon disc. He wrote this particular text in Dechen Teng, which was a retreat center at Tsurphu, the principal seat of the Karmapas. The other two seats are Gangchi Rawa in eastern Tibet near the border with China, and Karma Gön which was in Kham. Gangchi Rawa had a great sangha so it was symbolic of the body aspect, while Karma Gön had many scholars symbolic of the speech aspect, and Tsurphu had many meditators symbolic of the mind aspect.  Around five hundred meditators lived in Dechen Teng at Tshurpu until the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1959 when it was destroyed. Rangjung Dorje used to stay there and give teachings to the monks on retreat. It was during one of his resentences there that he wrote this text. Dechen Teng was a place dedicated to meditation. He gave this teaching on Differentiating Consciousness from Wisdom to many great meditators there. Therefore this text will be of great benefit to those practicing meditation.    
 101  7  The Five Buddha Families45  The Buddha represents the dharmakaya and there are five major wisdoms of the Buddha that are represented by the five sambhogakaya buddhas that make up the five Buddha families. Each buddha family represents a major disturbing emotion that is overcome by the wisdom. This is symbolically represented in the five buddha family mandala.   The essential task of a bodhisattva or a buddha is to develop the enlightened qualities of the five buddha families. These qualities pervade and are part of every sentient beings without exception, however, they are masked. To achieve the realization of these five buddha families, we must eliminate the five disturbing emotions of anger, attachment, ignorance, pride, and envy. When these disturbing emotions are pacified, the wisdom of the five wisdom buddhas will shine forth.   To understand how to cultivate the five wisdoms, we have to first understand the five disturbing emotions. The first disturbing emotion is anger or aggression which often appears to us as the strongest of these five emotions. We develop anger against a person or a situation that we dislike or that frustrates us. If we look at our anger carefully, we will see that anger does not benefit us in the short-term and is also harmful to us in the long-term. Anger is so powerful that it harms not only ourselves, but others as well. In the short term, anger leads to great conflict in this lifetime. In the long term, excessive anger can lead to a rebirth in a lower realm. Because intense anger can cause rebirth in the lowest hell realm, anger causes suffering in the next lifetime with even more intense suffering an even longer time.   45. This chapter on the five buddha families comes from Thrangu Rinpoche’s book The Five Buddha Families and The Eight Consciousnesses. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 102  When anger is purified, we gradually begin to realize mirror-like wisdom. With mirror-like wisdom we have no distinction between self and outside phenomena so everything is ex-perienced in unity and harmony. It is called mirror-like wisdom because phenomena appear to the mind in the same way that things appear in a clean mirror––completely accurate and without any distortion. Understanding and realizing mirror-like wisdom can only take place after the negative emotion of anger has been eliminated. Mirror-like wisdom is classically characterized as the wisdom of the Akshobhya Buddha, a buddha who is blue in color and holds a vajra in his left hand. He resides in the East in a mandala. The main activity of mirror-like wisdom is to pacify not only anger but also the emotions of suffering, illness, frustration, and sorrow.   When the disturbing emotion of pride is purified, the wisdom of equality emerges. This wisdom is associated with the buddha Ratnasambhava. As soon as we are born, we develop a belief of self or ego which is thinking, “I am separate from others.” This feeling of separation leads to the disturbing emotion of pride because we begin to think that we are better or superior to others. From this we begin to believe that there are desirable or “good” things which we want to have and “bad” or undesirable things and situations that we want to get rid of. This thinking then leads to pride and thinking that we are better than others. As long as we hold onto this belief, we will never be able to learn from others because we think we understand things better.   To purify our pride we must give up our ego clinging and work on developing the wisdom of equality in which we treat everyone equally. When we become free of pride, the wisdom of equality, which is associated with the Ratnasambhava buddha, begins to arise. Ratnasambhava is gold in color repre-senting his enriching qualities. He holds a wish-fulfilling jewel in his hands.   When the disturbing emotion of attachment or desire is purified, it leads to the realization of discriminating wisdom. This wisdom is associated with the Amitabha buddha and has 
The Five Buddha Families 
 103 the color of red denoting “compassion for everyone.” The disturbing emotion of desire causes much suffering because it distracts us and keeps our minds restless and busy. When we are attached to things, we are never satisfied and we always crave more and better things, relationships, or positions. Desire causes us to continually engage in work and other activities to acquire our mind’s desires. Since we continually want more and often we cannot get what we desire, this desire leads to dissatisfaction in our lives. By understanding this attachment and eliminating it, the discriminating wisdom shines forth, experience an enlightened mind, and become one with the Amitabha buddha. It is with this wisdom that we understand and have empathy for each and every living being and appreciate the immense number of qualities of others.   The Amitabha buddha’s nature with his magnetizing activity leads to the absence of attachment and desire. With discriminat-ing wisdom, we no longer have attachment and desire and thus are no longer dissatisfied and do not crave more and better things. This realization is so powerful that all things are naturally magnetized as our own. There is no energy or force involved in acquiring external things as we experienced when we were in a state of desire.   The fourth buddha is the Amoghasiddhi who resides in the North of a mandala and represents the absence of the disturbing emotion of jealousy including being jealous of others’ wealth, success, and good fortune. To over-come jealousy, we must embrace Amoghasiddhi who represents the realization of all-accomplishing wisdom. Jealousy prevents us from achieving a state of well being and as a result we experience more suffering and continue to develop further jealousy towards those who have more of what we desire. When this jealousy is removed, all our desires are naturally and effortlessly accomplished. But as long as jealousy determines our attitude, we are bound to experience more obstacles in achieving our personal success and in achieving positive goals for ourselves. Amoghasiddhi’s all-accomplishing activity is wrathful because he decisively 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 104 removes all obstacles and hindrances that prevent spiritual maturation and success. He is green in color, the same color as growing plants, with this symbolizing the numerous activities he employs to remove hindrances.   The fifth buddha is Vairochana who embodies the elimination of the disturbing emotion of ignorance. Ignorance is the failing to recognize what is wholesome and unwholesome, failing to understand the differences between ultimate and relative reality, and failing to realize the highest state of dharmata. Ignorance is also the root of the other disturbing emotions in that, for example, it is only out of ignorance that we become angry. We only act aggressively towards others because we do not understand that anger will only bring  pain and sorrow to ourselves and others. Likewise, it is only due to ignorance that we have pride, desire, and jealousy.   Elimination of the darkness of ignorance is the realization of Vairochana buddha who resides in the center of the mandala. The wisdom that shines forth when ignorance is overcome is the wisdom of dharmata, that is, the full realization of the nature of phenomena. Up until now we have failed to realize the way things really are because we possess ignorance that causes mental confusion and leads to negative actions. Purification of ignorance engenders realization of the wisdom that perceives the true nature of phenomena. The natural purity of the wisdom of dharmata is the Vairochana buddha. Since the darkness of ignorance is eliminated in him, he is depicted as being white in color.   Here we have given a brief description of the five wisdom buddhas who represent the purified qualities of the five disturbing emotions. When these five negative emotions are purified, the qualities of the five Buddhas shine forth. Now we will describe these five Buddhas in more detail.46   46. Many of the major characteristics of these five buddha families are given in Appendix C.  
The Five Buddha Families 
 105  1. AKSHOBHYA BUDDHA  At enlightenment, the disturbing emotion of anger is transformed into the Akshobhya buddha’s wisdom. We may wonder how the absence of anger results in developing wisdom specific to the Akshobhya buddha. To understand this, it is important to know that Akshobhya is a Sanskrit name and when it was translated into Tibetan it became sangye mikyodpa or the “immovable, stable and changeless buddha.” Akshobhya is called “immovable and changeless” because when the disturbing emotion of anger flares up, everything changes––our face becomes red, the body begins to shake, and the friend we are angry at becomes our enemy. When this anger is purified, we experience everything to be peaceful and stable which is the realization of the changeless, stable, permanent Akshobhya buddha.   The wisdom buddhas are each colored one of the five main colors: blue, red, yellow, green, and white. Akshobhya is blue in color which symbolizes changeless permanence, just as the sky has always been blue, whether it was this year or a thousand years ago. Furthermore, Akshobhya holds a vajra in his lap which is a symbol of his indestructible and changeless nature. He sits in the full vajra or full lotus posture to symbolize his indestructible nature and his right hand touches the earth which is also a gesture of the changeless nature. In a mandala Akshobhya resides in the east and sits on an elephant throne. Incidentally, in a mandala the position that is across from where we are sitting is always east regardless of what the real direction is. This direction of east for Akshobhya is true for almost all mandalas.  2. RATNASAMBHAVA BUDDHA   The Ratnasambhava buddha has the quality of being able to purify the disturbing emotion of pride. Ratnasambhava is 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 106 Sanskrit and is translated as sangye rinchen jungdan in Tibetan. The Tibetan word sangye means “buddha,” rinchen means “precious” referring to all precious, good, and immaculate things. The word jungdan means “the source.” So Ratnasam-bhava is the source of all good qualities with one of these precious qualities being the absence of pride. When we are able to overcome ego and pride, our mind is then open to receive all the positive wisdoms and qualities of the buddhas. This is the realization of sangye rinchen jungdan.   By knowing the meaning of rinchen jungdan, we can under-stand why his activity encompasses the enrichment of all the precious qualities of realization. Ratnasambhava resides in the south and is yellow or gold in color. The color gold represents wealth and Ratnasambhava holds in his hand a wish-fulfilling jewel at his heart. Incidentally, the left hand of all of the five wisdom buddhas is resting in the meditative posture of the changeless realization of dharmata. A wish-fulfilling jewel gives the person who owns it everything that they desire, and so, symbolizes enrichment. He is seated in the vajra posture on a horse’s throne representing the four bases or legs of miraculous powers that enable unobstructed passage everywhere. His right hand is in the position or mudra of supreme generosity (open palm facing outwards) showing that he has pure generosity.   3. AMITABHA BUDDHA  The third of the five buddha families is the Amitabha buddha who represents the purification of desire and attachment. When we are under the influence of wanting things, we are constantly discriminating between good and bad, desirable or undesirable, beautiful and ugly. We then grasp at what seems to be attractive and shun what seems bad or ugly.  Strong attachment and strong aversion to things arise from the lack of understanding of the true nature of phenomena. Amitabha embodies the wisdom of discrimination so we can apprehend phenomena without any confused and prejudiced 
The Five Buddha Families 
 107 opinions as to what it is and versus how it may appear to us. This discriminating wisdom comes about by purifying attachment and realizing Amitabha’s wisdom. Amitabha is Sanskrit his Sanskrit name and in Tibetan it is sangye odpamed. Sangye means “buddha” and odpamed means “boundless light.” When we have developed the awareness of knowing everything just as it manifests, we have developed the luminous clarity of boundless light which is completely free from confusion. We can compare this state of boundless light with an example of a lamp. A faulty lamp can illuminate a room only dimly whereas a perfect lamp allows us to see things distinctly and clearly. The light of Amitabha buddha is boundless and is realized through the purification of attachment and desire. Amitabha is red and belongs to the lotus family because a lotus grows in muddy water while its blossoms remain stainless. Likewise, Amitabha represents freedom from attachment which is a state of im-maculate, pure peace. Therefore, the Amitabha buddha is seated in the full vajra posture with both hands resting in his lap in the “zen” meditative posture of thumbs touching. Amitabha fully understands things as they are and also how they appear without having any subjective notions. He resides in the buddha realm of Sukhavati (Tib. Dewachen).  4. AMOGHASIDDHI BUDDHA  Amoghasiddhi buddha represents the realization of all-accom-plishing wisdom. The Tibetan word for the Amoghasiddhi buddha is sangye donyo trubpa. The word donyod means “meaningful” and trubpa means “accomplishment.” So Amo-ghasiddhi’s name means “whatever is meaningful and fruitful is accomplished.” He is also the complete purification of jealousy which is a hindrance for both material and spiritual success. His activity is perfect achievement and fulfillment of our spiritual aims. Furthermore, his activity removes ordinary daily hindrances such as illnesses and negative thoughts. This is why Amoghasiddhi activity is meaningful accomplishment. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 108 Amoghasiddhi holds a double-vajra in the form of a cross in his right hand, which symbolizes that his activity pervades and touches all directions. He sits in the full lotus posture. Amoghasiddhi’s right hand forms the mudra of fearless protection. He protects all living beings from any mishaps, obstacles, and negative influences so that his posture is known as “the mudra of fearless protection.” Amoghasiddhi is green, resides in the north, and holds a sword representing the cutting of samsaric existence.   5. VAIROCHANA BUDDHA  The fifth and final buddha family is that of Vairochana who is known as sangye namparnanzad or “perfect knowledge of all things as they manifest.” Vairochana’s wisdom is realized when the disturbing emotion of ignorance is removed. We cannot see phenomena as they really are as long as we have the disturbing emotion of ignorance which causes us to judge things from a mistaken point of view. With the realization of the wisdom of dharmata, we realize the Vairochana buddha. For example, if we have a rope lying on the floor in a dark room. Because of ignorance we mistake the rope for a snake and become alarmed and feel tremendous fear. The solution to eliminate this fear is to simply to see the rope as really being a rope, not a snake. This example shows how the mind functions in a state of ignorance. The distress and fear we experience is simply the result of misperceiving the situation because we are having an incorrect understanding of reality. Realizing this fact will eliminate this fear and distress.   In his lap Vairochana holds the wheel of Dharma with both hands symbolizing the wisdom that all things are dharmata. Realizing this occurs when ignorance is removed. This wheel of Dharma symbolizes the Buddha’s teachings, showing us what to abandon and what to adopt in our gradual advancement towards enlightenment. We learn how to give up negative emotions and how to develop wisdom. In the Buddha’s time, it was the wheels 
The Five Buddha Families 
 109 of a chariot that brought you to your destination. In a similar way, the wheel of Dharma carries us from the darkness of ignorance to the wisdom of the true nature of phenomena.  Vairochana’s mudra of holding up both hands to the heart is called the hand position representing “enlightenment” or sometimes it is called “the turning of the wheel of Dharma.” Since the only means to remove ignorance and the disturbing emotions is by learning the Dharma. So symbolically Vairo-chana teaches the Dharma to all living beings. He is white in color representing that he is “without a fault” and rests in the center of the mandala on a lion’s throne.   SUMMARY  In summary, Appendix C is a chart giving the sixteen character-istics of each wisdom buddha. Usually the deities are portrayed in a particular color and we can recognize the deity because the deity is holding a particular object and in a particular direction in the mandala. Each wisdom buddha is associated with a particular element, aggregate, element, and represents a wisdom that overcomes a particular disturbing emotion. It should be noted that some tantras will have a different color or hand position (mudra) or other characteristics for that particular buddha.47     47. When we think of an abstract quality such as compassion, it is very difficult to grasp it so these qualities are visualized in Vajrayana prac-tices as symbolic attributes to help bring these qualities to mind. How-ever, we should not think that these deities and their attributes were created by a committee of Vajrayana scholars. Thrangu Rinpoche has said that there are practices that we can do to actually see these deities as they are described. These deities are real because even non-Buddhists, knowing nothing about them, can actually see them while doing these practices. 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 110 Questions  Question: When we study the six realms of samsara, we learn that there is a predominant negative emotion for each realm. In the five disturbing emotions, these are transformed into the wisdom Buddhas. I noticed that the disturbing emotion of greed is not included.  Rinpoche: In the context of the six realms, the sixth disturbing emotion of greed will lead us to be reborn in the hungry ghost realm. The negative karma accumulated through the disturbing emotion of attachment leads us to take rebirth in the human realm where we experience the suffering of birth, illness, old age and death. Realization of the wisdom buddhas pertains to the five disturbing emotions. Greed is very much related to attachment. Due to attachment, an individual becomes very greedy and cannot be generous. Strong attachment leads us to take birth in the hungry ghost realm, whereas attachment without much greed leads us to take birth in the human realm. Therefore, attachment and greed are treated as the same when discussing the wisdom buddhas. Question: I have often heard the term “vajra pride” used very positively as an accomplishment of practice. Is this similar to the transformation of pride into equality? Rinpoche: Vajra pride (Tib. lhe ngagyel) and the disturbing emotion of pride (Tib. ngagyel) are quite different. The disturbing emotion of pride is like arrogance where we think we are better, more learned, or at a higher state of development than others and look down on upon them. Because of arrogance, we close ourselves off from the possibility of learning from others. This prevents spiritual and material maturation. As a result of pride we are bound to encounter more obstacles on the path. We think we know everything, but we actually know very little. Without pride we can learn from others and come to realize the wisdom of Ratnasambhava.   Vajra pride is different and arises from meditation practice. When we visualize ourselves as our yidam deity, we see 
The Five Buddha Families 
 111 ourselves as the deity and identify with it completely. This is called “vajra pride.” If we think we really aren’t the deity and are only pretending to be the deity, then we lack vajra pride. If we visualize ourselves as the deity without any doubts or uncertainty, we have vajra pride. Question: I heard Rinpoche say that the six consciousnesses are not one but very different with each having its own function. Why are they different? Rinpoche: They are called “the six types of consciousness” because each has a different function and they cannot function as one. For example, the visual consciousness makes it possible to see, but it cannot hear, taste, and so on. Therefore, the visual consciousness can only perceive visual objects. The ear con-sciousness perceives sounds, but it cannot see. Likewise, each consciousness perceives only a specific sensory input. After the eye, ear, nose, tongue and tactile consciousness perceives an object, the mental consciousness judges the sensory perception with thoughts. This is how each consciousness functions on its own.   The first five sensory consciousnesses are considered external meaning they deal with external input, whereas the mental consciousness is internal. Being internal the mind consciousness has the capacity to think. For example, you are sitting in this room and you still have the capacity to think about New York and Chicago with the sixth mental consciousness. You can internally imagine Chicago with the mental consciousness, which the eye consciousness doesn’t see. But our visual con-sciousness sees what is in front of us, therefore the external consciousnesses are rather restricted in comparison to the mental consciousness.  Question: I read that each individual belongs to a specific Buddha family. Is it useful to understand which family suits our mind? Rinpoche: Generally speaking, we all belong to one of the Buddha families. The easiest way to find out which Buddha family we belong to is by determining which disturbing emotion 
Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom 
 112 is most powerful within us. For example, if our anger is strongest, then we know we must employ greater remedies in order to overcome and transform that emotion into wisdom and therefore we belong to the vajra buddha family. Other individuals have different disturbing emotions which are strongest. Therefore it is up to us to examine our emotions and to learn to purify our strongest disturbing emotion. This leads us to realize our buddha family. Even if we know which buddha family we belong to, it is not essential to employ specific practices for that specific buddha family because ordinary Shamatha practice will reduce all of the disturbing emotions.  Question: Can you say something about the five aggregates (Skt. skandhas) and their relationship to the process of transforming the five disturbing emotions into the five wisdoms?  Rinpoche: The five skandhas are form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. They are called “the five gates of ego” in English. Purification of the first skandha of form is realization of Vairochana buddha. Purification of feeling is the realization of Buddha Ratnasambhava. Purification of percep-tion is Amitabha buddha. Purification of mental formation is Amoghasiddhi. Purification of consciousness is Amitabha buddha. We have related the five skandhas with the five wisdom buddhas. We know which disturbing emotion is purified upon realization, therefore we can find which disturbing emotion is related to which skandha.48  Question: How do we practice meditation when we are suffering from all the disturbing emotions? How is it best to practice? Is it with visualization of a particular Buddha? Rinpoche: The teachings on the five Buddha families, five wisdoms, and the purification of the five disturbing emotions are general instructions. The wisdoms and buddhas are the ultimate state. The method to reach the ultimate state is by transforming the five disturbing emotions into wisdoms which is achieved by  48. The disturbing emotion of each buddha family and the wisdom the purifies it is given in Appendix C. 
The Five Buddha Families 
 113 beginning with practicing the Four Preliminary practices (Tib. Ngöndro). Upon completion of the preliminaries, we continue practicing meditation. This enables us to transform the disturbing emotions into wisdom and achieve realization of the five wisdom Buddhas.  Question: I am a beginner in practice and have noticed that when certain people approach me when I am in a restaurant, I have a feeling of fear. Also I have noticed many times that I defend against fear by getting angry. I am wondering what the place of fear is in the disturbing emotions and why it wasn’t included?  Rinpoche: What did you eat in the restaurant? Fear isn’t a negative emotion. Fear needs a cause and is an effect of this cause. If you see a fire, the fire brings on fear as well as many other feelings. However, the method to overcoming fear is believing in the presence of enlightened beings. With that belief, you can believe that you are constantly protected by them––from any causes of fire, flood, earthquake, etc. With this belief, you can overcome fear. Anger is no protection from fear, actually it brings on even greater fear, pain, and frustration. For example, a very mean and evil person approaches you, If you have fear and develop anger towards him, you naturally react differently towards him and show this in your facial expression. Anger itself is very powerful and leads you to use harsh words. So in addition to the fear you are experiencing, you may get a punch in the nose. Therefore, anger isn’t a solution to protect you from fear.  Question: What is the cause of ignorance? Rinpoche: The lack of being familiar with wisdom and not having developed awareness are the two main causes of ignorance. With the absence of wisdom and awareness, we fail to learn how phenomena manifest and how really they are. Our mind has built up the habitual pattern of ignorance since beginningless time and remains entangled in its darkness.    End of text. 
 114 Appendix A  The Five Aggregates (Skt. Skandhas)  The Five Aggregates are part of the Foundation Vehicle’s Abhi-dharma which were the earliest teachings on Buddhism.  First Aggregate: Form  Form is everything that is perceived by the five senses. The first aggregate is rocks, trees, houses, our body,  people, sky, the water we drink, and so on. Form is the raw external information that is perceived by our sense organs. Because we perceive forms as being outside our mind, it leads to the misconception that outside phenomena are solid and real leaving us to our self-centered perception of our world.   At this first level, our perception of form is just raw sensory information that is processed by our sensory organs––eye, ear, nose, tongue, and bodily sensations. This aggregate is connected with the Akshobhya buddha and is compared to a mirror reflecting the sensa-tions without any categorization or evaluation called the mirror-like wisdom.  Second Aggregate: Feeling  From the processing of the sense organs, the information moves to the five sensory consciousnesses. There it is processed by the second aggregate of feeling and we feel pleasure or pain or just a neutral feeling with the information. These emotions are more on a subconscious level and result in our reacting with desire or dislike to the outside phenomena.  The second aggregate of feeling is connected to the disturbing emotions of pride and the Ratnasambhava buddha. Ratnasambhava represent the wisdom of equality which overcome the continuous judgmental feeling that everything is either desirable or undesirable, good or bad, or better or no than me.    
The Five Aggregates 
 115 Third Aggregate: Perception  At this third stage of perception, the information is linked to actual perception is then combined with our memories providing a clear recognition of the information, so we remember it. The perception can now be related to our experience. For example, we see and hear a dog barking at us and we can react based on past experience with a kindness we have had with dogs making it an enjoyable situation or we may have had a bad experience with a dog. Conversely, we may been bitten and then we hence react with fear.  This aggregate of perception is connected with the Amitabha buddha whose purified perception looks deeply into phenomena and is not influenced by their superficial appearance.   The Fourth Aggregate: Conditioning  At this level of perception the information gives rise to emotions, ideas, ingrained beliefs along with all our karmic latencies connected with it. These are part of our mind stream and leads to our actions of body, speech, and mind. These perceptions are usually classified into the 51 mental factors. These include negative factors as such as the five disturbing emotions, the twenty secondary afflictions, but also positive factors such as virtuous factors. All of these lead to positive or negative karma. See Appendix D.  This level of mental functioning is connected to the Amoghasiddhi buddha who is head of the karma family. The disturbing emotion connected with this aggregate of conditioning is jealousy and this is overcome by all-accomplishing wisdom.  The Fifth Aggregate of Consciousness  This mental aggregate is the highest level of mental functioning and consists of all of the thinking that goes on in our mind before we become enlightened. This aggregate is the complete functioning and interaction of the seventh and eight consciousnesses.  This level of mental functions is represented by Vairochana who represents dharmadhatu wisdom or all-encompassing wisdom of phenomena. 
 116 Appendix B The Transformation of the Consciousnesses  into Wisdoms 
 

Transformation of Consciousnesses into Wisdom 
 117 Explanation of  Transforming Consciousnesses into Wisdoms  Column 1: In Tibetan Buddhism there are six organs associated with the five sensory organs and the mind. Column 2: Each sensory organ showe has a consciousness connected to it that interprets the information form the organs. .  For example, the eye organ changes light waves into electrical impulses and it is the eye consciousness (or visual consciousness) which turns these into images for the mind to process. This is true for the other four consciousness as well.  The sixth mental consciousness receives all the information for the five sensory consciousnesses and processes it based on what currently is perceived, past experiences, and thoughts that just happen to be in the mind. This sixth consciousness has two aspects: the nonconceptual mind which is the sensory information that is turned into thoughts; and the conceptual mind which is the constant discursive commentary we have going on in our head.  The seventh consciousness has two aspects. One is the immediate mind which connects all the instants of consciousness into a coherent, orderly pattern of thoughts. Second, it has the klesha or afflicted aspect which is the constant presence of self we have had for many lifetimes.  The eighth consciousness accumulates all the actions of the other seven consciousnesses including the latent karmic imprints which can express themselves later under the appropriate circumstances. This consciousness is considered the source of all samsaric appearances called the “store house” aspect and it is distinguished from the other aspect which organizes the other seven consciousnesses.  Column 3: Shows which consciousness is transformed into which of the five buddha wisdoms upon reaching enlightenment.  Column 4: Shows each of the buddha wisdoms which is associated with a particular kaya. For example, the all accomplishing wisdom––the wisdom of how to teach the dharma––is connected with nirmanakaya which is the kaya involving beings on this earth.  
 118  An Explanation of The Eight Consciousnesses  1. We begin with an external object (Example: a tree)  2. We have five sense organs (the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body touch receptors. (Example: the eye). These organs are momen-tary (always changing) and non-conceptual.  3. These organs send information to the five consciousnesses––Visual, Auditory, Olfactory, Gustatory, Touch Consciousnesses. The consciousnesses are in the brain and are non-conceptual processors of the information.   4. Then the combinations of these consciousnesses go to the Sixth Mental Consciousness or discursive mind and are combined with past experiences and thoughts and feelings. This consciousness is momentary. (Example: this is a tree house in my back yard that was built last year).  5. This Sixth Consciousness interacts with the Seventh Afflicted Consciousness that is the always present feeling of “I” which we have had for many lifetimes. (Example: That is my tree house)  6. The Seventh Consciousness passes the information along to the Eighth Store-house Consciousness which stores the event with its positive, neutral, or negative karma. This Eighth Consciousness also sends back information to the Sixth Con-sciousness along with past thoughts and feelings. (Example: I love (or I hate) this tree house.)  Note: This is based on the Mind-only school which has eight consciousness and is the one used in this text. Some other Buddhist schools have only six consciousnesses.

 120  The Ten Bodhisattva Levels The bodhisattva levels (Skt. bhumis) are the stages a bodhisattva goes through on the way to enlightenment and as described in the Dasha-bhumika Sutra.  1. Joyful. This first bodhisattva level corresponds to the third path of seeing and is the bodhisattvas’ first realization of emptiness. Through this he or she achieves the perfection of the paramita of generosity.  2. Pure or Immaculate. At this level, all immoral conduct and dispositions are eliminated through the bodhisattvas’ achieve-ment of the second perfection of morality.  3. Luminous. At this level, through meditation the bodhisattva strengthens and deepens his or her insight. This is done by mastering the perfection of patience. 4. Radiant or Brilliant. At this level, all the good qualities are vigorously pursued and all the obstacles and disturbing emotions are eliminated through the perfection (paramita) of diligence.  5. Hard-to-conquer. The bodhisattvas develop full understanding of the four noble truths, relative and ultimate truth, and the definitive meaning of the scriptures through the mastery of the perfection of meditation. 6. Facing Forward. Great insight is gained into the true nature of phenomena and the profound realization of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. This is done through the mastery of the perfection of wisdom. 7. Going Far. At this level the bodhisattva purifies incorrect views and master the perfection of skillful means so he or she can benefit vast numbers of beings. The eighth through tenth bodhisattva levels are considered the pure bodhisattva levels. 8. Immeasurable. At this level the bodhisattva has abandoned all disturbing emotions and therefore will not fall back into a lower bodhisattva level. Associated with Perfection of aspiration. 9. The Good. The bodhisattva preaches the Dharma and helps many beings to progress spiritually through perfection of power. 10. Cloud of the Dharma. At this highest level the bodhisattva reaches full perfection and becomes a fully enlightened Buddha. Achieved through the perfection of knowledge.

Literally, “heaps.” The Buddha in the Surangama Sutra, taught that sentient beings are not solid and enduring objects, but are rather collections or “heaps” composed of five aggregates. These are the five basic transformations that perceptions undergo when an object is perceived. First is form which includes all sounds, smells, that become a direct perception without concept. Second are sensations (pleasant and unpleasant, etc.), third is perception which is actually identifying the information. Fourth is formation which combines the information with past experiences. The fifth is consciousness which is our ordinary discursive mind. See Appendix A for more details.  alaya consciousness (Tib. künshi namshe). According to the Mind Only school this is the eighth consciousness, often called the ground consciousness or store-house consciousness, because it stores the karmic latencies. analytical meditation. In the sutra tradition one begins by listening to the teachings which means studying the Dharma. Then there is contemplation of this Dharma which is analytical insight which is done by placing the mind in Shamatha and putting the mind one-pointedly on these concepts. arhat.
