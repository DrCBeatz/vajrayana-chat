 [Music]
 you're listening to it conversation the
 video podcast of Banyan books and sound
 I'm your host foreign Israeli and I'm
 very honored to be here with minge
 Rinpoche he's a much loved meditation
 master in Tibetan Buddhist teacher an
 author of several books his latest book
 is called in love with the world which
 were counts his four years on a
 wandering retreat in India and Himalayas
 so wonderful to have you here and push a
 thank you thank you very much so I'd
 like to start off with asking the big
 question why you were a bit of a
 monastery in Bodhgaya I imagine it was a
 very comfortable familiar life and very
 esteemed role and he left it all I'm
 inspired and we have this tradition
 called wandering retreat so when I was
 young my mother used to read books about
 those great meditators in the Tibet the
 life story of those meditators and then
 I was born in Himalaya mountain in power
 so winter is quite cold and we all get
 together around fire and then my mother
 a book and up the student never my
 grandma will cry and I cry and we all
 cry so that really give me really kind
 of like great aspiration and then
 normally like mountains and nature so I
 did retreat for three years Richard and
 Indira to discuss about how to meditate
 you can meditate everywhere any times so
 I was this inspiration and it with me
 for a long time then and in 2011 I
 decided and I got the one related what
 was it about those stories that gave you
 the inspiration was there
 realizations that those wandering Yogi's
 had on retreat or was it the adventure
 of doing something completely different
 yeah so the main thing is about why we
 do this one routine is adding wood to
 the fire so first we will to practice
 meditation with kind of light right with
 the right circumstances and then if you
 go to the many different kind of light
 environment especially with the
 challenge with a lot of typical
 situation so we can hardest meditation
 with those typical circumstances so they
 really help us to improve our meditation
 and in your retreat what were some of
 the most difficult situations and
 circumstances that you face in my rigid
 so although I'm I've known meditation
 for since when I was nine years old and
 about the time I really want to do this
 one retreat and I prepare about going on
 the street but the most difficulty is
 when I leave my monastery I'm certainly
 out there alone so normally my life it's
 very comfortable everywhere I go there's
 a lot of people to care me and I never
 stay alone even one day so Sutton is a
 really big typical so almost like what I
 imagine it's kind of run naive so when
 you really come on the street there's a
 lot of things that I have to learn and a
 lot of things that emotional level
 physical level environment level a lot
 of difficult challenge did it in these
 difficult circumstances and unfamiliar
 situations did it sharpen and deepen
 your experience and practice of
 meditation yeah I think it really helps
 me I did I learned two things the first
 it really ain't
 hence my meditation so even though you
 face this typical situation at the
 beginning of ritual I almost died
 because of the food poison so very
 difficult but because of my meditation
 really helps I almost died but that was
 the one of the best experience in my
 life really helps second important thing
 is what I learned is I learned a lot of
 things about life and I have to go there
 alone and I have to survive everything
 by myself and I remember that when I
 went to the mountains and I have to make
 fire so to make fire take a few days to
 make fire in the end I was very happy oh
 now that's fire and what to do is I had
 to boil hot water and it took me two
 hours to boil one hot water after that
 what has a boil I was so happy and when
 I begin to dream tastes like smoke it
 was I was you know lowering the fire and
 then just producing a lot of smoke
 so should I learn a lot about the life
 tell us a little bit about the your
 near-death experience I mean that must
 have been a profound experience to be so
 close to death until it survived it was
 not like yes or the food after I have
 few thousand rupees at the beginning I
 had three thousand Indian rupees then
 all this money and finished within three
 weeks so then I was on the street so no
 money to buy food and then I went to one
 restaurant and beg the food they said oh
 you come in the night before they closed
 the restaurant so then I went there and
 they give me leftover food so that I
 think might be not
 I had that then that night African have
 diarrhea area and vomiting
 the next day continued so for five days
 I want to drink the the palm bill water
 so then that was a really kind of like
 difficult and then in the end I become
 paralyzed cannot see cannot hear and
 then what I did is I just practiced
 meditation so what we call the essence
 of meditation is to be with the
 awareness so although there's a lot of
 different experience there I feel like
 falling then losing the senses then
 become body become paralyzed by my mind
 to become clear when I were as small
 with this awareness mind become more
 clear more open in the end it's not not
 like hard not like the feeling that what
 we have the sensation the body thought
 with the image all this is a gone but -
 really fast
 completely open and I know what's going
 on but then there's no really words
 about what I'm experienced so beyond or
 knowledge beyond concept yet knows but
 I'm present so I'm in that state for a
 few hours and that is really giving me
 great insight about my meditation is
 that state the goal of meditation
 practice goal of meditation practice is
 to connect with that awareness which is
 always with us but it is not that to get
 rid of thought and emotion and feeling
 so but when we die
 it comes automatically by-product
 because of the time so we have this
 dying meditation so people meditators
 die with the meditation my father with
 my when my father died he was in the
 time meditation for three days my
 grandpa was a great meditator
 he was in that state for three and half
 days so when you are in the dime
 meditation your your body not suddenly
 become rotten and almost you look like
 normal Lulay smiling and face growing
 then up three days later the meditation
 finished as soon as amenities you
 finished the body become my ears and
 then change everything so on everything
 like that so my meditation is them when
 we die with this joyful non conceptual
 experience be with that state so that's
 the one we call dying meditation so that
 is not the particular goal of meditation
 when we practice in this life of course
 we have thought and emotion and feeling
 they say okay let's explore that a
 little bit further because that seems an
 easy route to take in context of our
 subject but all emotions all emotions
 how can one develop the ability to be in
 awareness even when very strong
 unpleasant emotions arise so what we
 call a ban this is like sky taught
 emotion feeling memory or this a light
 clock so no matter how much cloud in the
 sky or what kind of cloud it doesn't
 matter for the sky beautiful cloud ugly
 cloud stone or blue sky for the sky it
 doesn't matter so awareness is like sky
 all of it is present there and then
 thought emotion feeling the moon is a
 cloud comes and goes comes course so the
 meditation is to connect with the
 awareness not try to get it apart and
 feeling emotion so when we more makhani
 with awareness itself then we are not
 lost
 in the thought and emotion so to do
 do that the step-by-step Rajasthan begin
 with the word people breathing
 meditation so you aware of your breath
 so the breath is the object of your
 meditation breathing in everything else
 and there's there's a true type of
 meditation the object oriented or
 subject oriented the object oriented
 meditation meaning the breath is
 important stay with the breath and for
 us is the subject oriented the awareness
 is important so to maintain awareness
 spread it's just object so you learn
 this with the breath eventually you can
 watch your own feeling like stress
 sensation in your body the stress panic
 depression Semler you're watching the
 breath you can watch them and so
 normally what we call if you see the
 river you're out of River you don't have
 to stop the river so then you see panic
 when you see the feeling of stress that
 means there's space between you and
 stress yes in addition to emotions can
 you talk a little bit about self and the
 identity that we have that is part of
 our part of our personality and what how
 subject meditation may help us to break
 through that or break free of that yeah
 so there are three South so what we call
 unhealthy sense of self and healthy
 sense of self and then self beyond so
 there's three layers the first is
 unhealthy which is very sensitive easy
 to cry easy to laugh easy to froze is it
 to burn if someone says something
 slightly wrong you feel unhappy days
 someone say something nice and
 secondly episode as a really light very
 sensitive and delicate so that's the
 service level and below that there's
 healthy sense of self and that self is
 connected with the more open clear
 clarity what we call the sense of love
 compassion wisdom so unhealthy sense of
 self says you have to win an other
 applause at the healthy sense of self
 says we all are same kind and
 compassionate supported so you can
 experiment them whatever if you follow
 over to the hell unhealthy sense of self
 even you achieve a lot you will not
 really feel that the peace joy that
 comes inside you you still feel hollow
 but if you listen to healthy sense of
 self like do social walk help others
 really feel happy from inside so real
 you is more connected with that healthy
 sense of self and below them what we
 call the self beyond me or sometimes
 when people luminous self so that is the
 boundless free and that is the awareness
 like sky that always with us and there's
 a peaceful calm presence but we are not
 recognize that not so easy to recognize
 if we can talk a little bit more about
 the healthy sense itself how is that
 connected with free will so the healthy
 sense of self a actually is calling us
 all the time so no matter how much you
 achieve the deeper level there's still
 something more this is not the meaning
 of life what is this all about
 so this kind of genuine question is
 there so when you when you explore their
 question the really meaning of life is
 thing which is connected with love
 compassion something which is connected
 with care about you and others so that
 healthy sense of self is the real kind
 of life who you who we are actually
 and you know speaking on love and
 compassion you titled the book in love
 with the world a little bit about that
 title and what what your experience was
 in coming up with that to describe the
 book yeah at the beginning when I went
 to the on the strip Street I feel like
 why I'm here
 I'm not belong here I see the streets
 very dirty unsaved lot of dogs around me
 and in the daytime we are ok with the
 dogs and nighttime when I move little
 bit the old chased me and the scary so
 then I have this almost died experience
 then in the end I back I rest in Dublin
 and then I come back so when I come back
 everything's changed now now I feel like
 so happy to be alive
 the street become like my home and I
 remember this tree in from me and when I
 look at the tree while the tree is so
 alive so the leaves are shining and what
 I call that
 the tree become like tree is the made by
 love and wind blows to my face feelings
 so pleasant joy so much appreciation
 gratitude then after that for me in like
 unsaved the feeling of unsaved is
 I feel like everybody's like my home so
 normally what and then what I call is if
 you love the world Laura loves you back
 so it really helps the rest of my
 journey it really really become kind of
 like joyful because that that tends
 inside me and say and all these are gone
 once I free and I walk with it and free
 and all the sudden I find a lot of other
 opportunities lot of kind of like even
 though I know where I should go way to
 find food so a lot of things happen I
 put about that do you think that that's
 insight that's relevant to modern people
 that the experience of inside is
 reflected on the outside that somehow
 our inner and outer worlds are connected
 yeah so in Irak I really connect for me
 like when we think for example I have
 one friend and he was army before and he
 had the general which is quite a stir
 and he don't believe anybody eating you
 know everybody you know have to pick on
 Paul and have a lot of rooms in the army
 camp
 you cannot go after 7:00 p.m.
 then you have to do all this and people
 don't like him actually and they are
 breaking the rules and cheating him and
 few years later they changed the general
 and the new general is full of love and
 it just everybody who you're all of
 mature and of course we have these rules
 but you can see whether sometimes you
 know if you have some important you just
 go and you don't have to tell me even
 we all try our best and then it's
 flexible you know I believe you I trust
 you at the beginning all this I'm his
 friend
 they don't believe oh maybe it is a trap
 or something it's not real but it slowly
 sort of believed they all really like
 this new general and they support this
 new general and insulate the rules and
 the discipline everything become much
 better so it's become really productive
 everybody really support and they work
 together
 love each other so I think it's a really
 important how you your belief says the
 world for you I would like to speak a
 little bit about sleep and dreaming and
 the chapter that you wrote about how
 when we fall asleep there's a
 dissolution of senses and we're not even
 aware of what happens I mean other than
 remembering dreams can you just speak a
 little bit about about the importance of
 sleep and sleep meditation and and what
 that is of the purpose of it yeah so in
 the one before in the Bardo meditation
 so this book is about the death and
 dying my new book in love with the world
 so I use my own experience about almost
 die as the practice as part of that kind
 of light story in the book so normally
 bar do practice is like part of many in
 between or intermediate or in
 translation so in between this moment a
 really precious moment that if you know
 how to be with this moment and actually
 you can transform that whatever you want
 to transform it's more easy because
 normally we have this a lot of
 conceptual or fix mine so in the during
 this moment this fixed concept fix mine
 dies
 and we need to let die our cell if you
 don't die you can a rebirth
 so like break up lose the job second is
 something correcting habit or children
 18 years old move away from home
 everything survive by yourself or what
 are things like that in our life help we
 are facing those things so these things
 are kind of a portal in between moment
 very important and another thing is
 going to sleep this is the moment of the
 dying and the having dream stage all
 these are also in between the stage so
 when we go to sleep actually we are
 dying we die our concept our memory our
 all this guy and then there's a
 disillusion experience if you feel like
 falling floating burn and then we feel a
 blown away in the end and then stir and
 then feel a little bit down and then
 feel almost unconscious and suddenly
 there's one second or half second very
 peaceful state of mind and if he be in
 that state whole sleep become meditation
 so that is what we call sleeping
 meditation but it very fast you're in a
 sleep we don't we don't feel it but when
 we're going to die we will have this
 experience for me I had a very clear
 experience stuff when I almost died
 falling floating oh there's a long clear
 so I thought mmm when I really die if I
 have like this you know I can meditate
 I'm so curious to hear you speak about
 just the value of under
 all the small ways that we must learn to
 die in our everyday lives and what what
 does it look like to let go and to die
 to our old perceptions or thoughts yep
 yep so first important is you need to
 accept the life is like wave of the
 ocean life is like stock market so what
 we call impermanence practice of
 impermanence changing up and down up and
 down the stock market go up and down so
 we make business right
 if the Stromer gets flat then you cannot
 have business so actually live go up and
 down is great we learn from up and down
 we grow from up and down so sometime
 what we called obstacle is the best
 opportunity when you look at the history
 all the great success ful persons they
 fail a lot at the beginning they learn
 from they didn't not give up so the
 thing is we have to accept that and
 continue to grow learn from obstacle
 learn from problem so what we call don't
 give up let it go let it go meaning
 accept the nature of reality and follow
 the flow of the nature by the same time
 about continued grow continue to learn
 so that's the part of how to practice
 the botto so when we are facing big
 problem actually that might be opening
 new door maybe we learn something great
 inside of them maybe that's the best
 opportunity what happened later in your
 life so whatever our fix believe the
 concept let go and then don't give up we
 all have great capacity we all have
 great talents we all are unique
 we have love compassion wisdom capacity
 so try your best and then that is really
 really I mean that for me
 great practice and and I become exciting
 I like to ask you about one of my
 favorite Zen quotes because I think it
 very much applies to your life and that
 is before enlightenment chop wood carry
 water after enlightenment chop wood
 carry water and you were in a role
 before you went on this retreat and
 you're in the role again what's changed
 yeah for me first when I when out there
 of course very challenge the beginning
 but the later is really really great
 insight and coming back I have to be
 prepared to face with the busy schedule
 teaching and I really like teaching
 because these meditation practices
 really change my life kind of like what
 now who who I am now is because of them
 this meditation practice so I really
 believe this thing I really would share
 this to others so I felt I feel normally
 kind of like sharing this to others this
 is kind of my job so when I come back I
 don't really feel big gap you know stay
 in the mountain alone I'm suddenly faced
 with other people uncomfortable or this
 I don't feel any particular tense but
 the one I remember then when I come back
 to my monastery and I want to open my
 and suddenly I saw six hands around my
 back because people like to help me you
 know they all want to help me
 that was quite otherwise I'm happy to be
 back also and lastly what is your
 aspiration for this book and you're
 teaching tour so I hope this book really
 benefit nowadays the world is really
 facing anxiety so when I finish my tea
 to say oh this is age of anxiety there's
 a lot of anxiety so the next problem is
 that we have this anxiety problem
 and the base of basis of this anxiety is
 death and I'm actually so when we try to
 ignore death and time the fear grows
 fear become even stronger but we can
 face it and we can learn from that and
 actually it really helps so I hope this
 benefit for kind of light know how to
 walk with the fear and eventually how to
 work with the get and I thank you so
 much it's been so wonderful to share
 time with you and listen about the
 experiences you had in the insights and
 also just to learn more about different
 practices that you teach thank you so
 much thank you very much you're most
 welcome
