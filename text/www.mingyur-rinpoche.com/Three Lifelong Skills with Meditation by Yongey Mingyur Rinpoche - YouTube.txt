 Three Lifelong Skills
 with Meditation
 Normally,
 when we learn meditation
 we are not only learning
 how to be with the breath
or sounds
 or whatever
meditation object,
 but at the same time
 the most important thing,
 which is something
very important
 for our life —
 what I sometimes call
 “three lifelong skills.”
 What are these
three lifelong skills?
 For example,
 maybe I will ask you
a question.
 Let’s say. . .
 do not think about pizza.
 Try not to think
about pizza now.
 Are you thinking
about pizza?
 If you think
about pizza. . .
 I told you not to think
about pizza,
 so if you do,
this is a big problem.
 Now I know you are
thinking about pizza.
 That is what we call
 “aversion”
 or “resentment.”
 Or sometimes
it may transform into
 hatred or anger.
 As long as you try
to push something away,
 what happens?
 That object or
that phenomenon becomes
 kind of unpleasant,
unlovable,
 noisy, louder, disturbing.
 It does not matter
what kind of object.
 It does not matter.
 Normally we think
of the best,
 but suddenly somehow
if you have resentment,
 it becomes unpleasant.
 So that manifests within
 our relationships
with our partners
 and colleagues
at our workplace,
 and it also manifests
in the environment,
 at your job,
 in your studies.
 Sometimes we say
 “we make our own enemies
by ourselves.”
 Since we make them,
we can free ourselves.
 It is in our hands.
 Okay,
 that is the first problem.
 The second problem.
 How many of you
 really want to go
to sleep at night —
 “I need sleep,
I need sleep” —
 and what happens?
Sleep runs away.
 You become more
awake and alert,
 rolling to the right side,
 rolling to the left side.
 “I need sleep,”
and sleep disappears.
 If so, raise your hand.
 Or maybe, “It is too late.
I want to sleep,
 I do not want to touch
my smartphone.”
 But you pick it up.
That may also happen.
 That is what we call
“craving.”
 When we have
a strong craving,
 we become out of control.
 Then we become a slave
 to that phenomenon,
situation, object,
 person, or whatever.
 That is the second problem.
 The third problem,
 the big problem,
 is that we do not see things
very clearly.
 We do not know reality
very clearly.
 How can we see things
clearly?
 The first important thing
is that we need to learn
 to be with it “as it is.”
 We have to accept
whatever it is —
 we do not need to change
too much, add things,
 or get rid of things.
 The 1st thing is to
just see the situation,
 thing, phenomenon, object,
or whatever as it is.
 If we do not do that,
it is “ignorance.”
 So the third problem
 is not seeing things
as they are.
 We are prejudging.
We have preconceptions,
 sometimes related with
 childhood experiences,
trauma —
 so many things there.
 We cannot really
get rid of them,
 but what we can do is
 just see things
as they are.
 Then wisdom develops.
 Now, what are
the three lifelong skills?
 The first skill is wisdom —
 seeing things as they are.
 The second skill is
what I call
 “learning to be okay
 with not okay.”
 So we need to learn
acceptance,
 openness,
 flexibility, forgiveness,
 kindness, compassion,
all these things.
 The last,
 the third skill,
 is to not be lost,
but to be present.
 How can we do that?
 Once you already have
a habit,
 it is difficult
to become free of it.
 Whatever you do
aids or becomes
 a support for your problem.
 When I was young,
I had panic attacks.
 But for me the biggest
problem was panic of panic.
 So once you are
in that trap
 it is difficult
to become free.
 But there is another way.
 Another way
is through meditation.
 First we choose
a neutral object —
 maybe your breath,
 sound,
 a visual object, a stone,
 a flower,
or something else.
 Anything can be used
as support — a table,
 the sky,
 water, or anything
 that we need to be with.
 We say the essence
of meditation
 is awareness.
 Awareness means that
you know
 what you are thinking,
feeling, doing. . .
 Can you see my hand?
 That is awareness,
 and that becomes
meditation now.
 Do you believe it?
 At the beginning I did not
believe it, but now I do.
 When I was first learning,
 my father told me
something like that.
 I thought it was too easy,
but actually that is all.
 When you look at my hand,
 your eyes look at my hand
 and also, at the same time,
 your mind looks at my hand.
 When your eyes and mind
 are both together
with my hand,
 that becomes meditation.
 We will do this today
with breathing meditation.
 We can practice
this together.
 First of all,
 I would like to ask you
a question.
 How many of you
are breathing right now?
 If you are breathing
right now, raise your hand.
 I hope that while
you are watching this video
 or hearing this audio,
 you are raising your hand.
 That means you are
breathing, right?
 Of course, you might think,
 “Ha! Stupid question!
 Of course I am breathing,
I am alive!”
 That is all!
 That is now breathing
meditation.
 You have learned it.
 Why does that become
meditation?
 Because when I asked you,
 “Are you breathing now?”
 in that moment your
mind was with the breath.
 When the breath and mind
are together
 it becomes breathing
meditation.
 Let’s try this together.
 Please, again,
 keep your spine
loosely straight.
 If you want,
you can close your eyes.
 Relax your body,
 relax the muscles
in your body.
 Feel the tactile sensation
 between your body
and the chair, cushion,
 or whatever
you are sitting on.
 And feel the room
temperature —
 a warm, cold,
 or perfect temperature,
or whatever.
 Now,
 be aware of your breath.
 Breathing in,
 breathing out.
 And it is natural
breathing now.
 You do not need
to control your breath.
 Shallow breathing is ok,
 deep breathing is okay,
 irregular breathing is okay,
 tight breathing is okay,
 relaxed breathing is okay. . .
 Just natural breathing.
 While your mind
 is being with the breath,
 so much “blah, blah,
yada, yada” will come.
 “What shall I do tomorrow?”
 “Oops, I forgot something.”
 “Oh, my to-do list.”
 “Oh, the pizza is coming.”
 Whatever those thoughts are,
let them come.
 As long as you do not
forget the breath,
 anything can come up.
 Again we completely
forget the breath.
 No problem.
 Remember again.
 Remember for glimpses
of the breath.
 So, now you have
already learned
 the three lifelong skills
with breathing meditation.
 Natural breath,
 being with the breath
as it is,
 is the beginning
of developing wisdom.
 All the “blah, blah,
yada, yada” —
 — all the mistakes,
 problems, worries,
 to-do lists —
let them come.
 There is no need
to stop them.
 Remember, if you say,
“Do not think,”
 you will think more.
 Now let them come,
let them go.
 That is skill number two.
 Skill number three.
 You are not completely lost.
 You are being
with the breath again —
 what we call
“short times, many times.”
 These three skills
you can apply
 in your workplace.
 Whatever you do,
your work,
 be there with clarity,
be present with it.
 When you are with it
as it is
 then you begin to see
the situation clearly.
 But at the same time,
 everywhere there are problems
and mistakes.
 That is normal!
 We can learn and grow
from problems.
 Normally,
problems are okay.
 Problems, obstacles,
and all this
 help us to grow
and learn.
 Let them come,
let them go,
 but do not get lost
completely.
 You always come back to
 your work, studies,
 or connection with others.
 You can apply this
to relationships,
 and they will become
more open,
 more genuine,
 and more harmonious.
 And your studies, also.
 If your mind is tight, or
 if you give up,
you cannot study well.
 So if you learn this skill
 with your studies,
you also learn a lot.
 I think this is beneficial
for me,
 and I would like to
share this with you
 and hope it brings benefits
to your life.
 Thank you.
