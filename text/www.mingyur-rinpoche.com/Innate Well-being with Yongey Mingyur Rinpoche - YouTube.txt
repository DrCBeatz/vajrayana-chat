 .
 I want to tell you
 a short story.
 Many of you know about
 basic innate goodness,
right?
 This has been translated
 from Tibetan.
 We have “deshek nyingpo,”
 “the enlightened essence.”
 “Kadak,”
 the “original purity.”
 “Buddha nature,”
 the essence of
 the Buddha.
 There are so many
translations here,
 and if you want to make
them all into one,
 then maybe we can
translate it as before
 as “basic innate goodness.”
 But I found a new one.
 I just discovered it
maybe 10 days ago:
 “innate well-being.”
 This is related to all
 the essence of all these
different translations.
 The main thing is,
 as I think all of you know,
 that our fundamental nature
 is wholesome,
 complete,
 pure, beyond
 concept,
beyond suffering,
 and beyond problems.
 Actually,
we are not broken by nature,
 we are complete by nature.
 Especially nowadays,
 the language
is very important.
 So I want to choose
“innate well-being,”
 as it is quite easy
for everybody to understand.
 As for the main
meaning of this,
 sometimes I talk about
 how we might have
10 qualities,
 1 negative and 9 positive. . .
 I have mentioned this
many times.
 The 1 negative quality
 is only on the surface level.
 On the surface level,
 what we think is that
there is singularity,
 which is self-centric.
 “Me,” number one.
 “I have to win,
others have to lose.
 What about me?”
 It is ego-centric
or self-centric.
 That is singularity.
 And that there is
independence —
 we want to control.
 We do not want to care
about others.
 And that there is
permanence —
 we do not want to have
 unexpected surprises.
 It seems like we
do not want to change.
 These three together
 are what we sometimes call
 “the unhealthy
sense of self.”
 It is very unhealthy.
 It is not just unhealthy,
 but it causes a lot
of suffering and pain,
 and it brings problems
into your life,
 your social circle,
your family,
 your company,
your workplace.
 Everywhere
there are big problems.
 Do you agree?
 So do you have that?
 If yes, raise your hand.
 Normally, most of us think,
 “Yes, I have plenty of those.
 Sounds familiar!
 90% of who I am
is those things.”
 But actually,
it is just 10%.
 We have more
wonderful things within us.
 Opposite to singularity,
 there is so much
 multiplicity,
 meaning that who we are
has so many pieces,
 so many different qualities,
 so many different skills,
 knowledge, wisdom,
capacity.
 We have many things there,
 but we are not aware
of those pieces.
 We are not aware
of those qualities.
 To connect with the pieces,
 bring awareness
 and you can connect
with your own different
 parts of qualities,
 different skills,
different potentials.
 These innate qualities
 are manifesting and
 radiating all the time.
 Second, independence.
 We want to have control,
 and we do not want
to care about others.
 On the surface level,
we think,
 “I have to win
(singularity),
 and I do not care
about others.
 Everything has to be
in my hands.”
 Even if you follow that
 you may not be happy.
 Even if you become
successful,
 you will automatically know
 “that is not who I am.”
 You feel something
is missing.
 Maybe you can try
 to do some experimenting.
 Maybe do some social work.
 Get out there.
 Even help your
family members,
 your pets,
cats and dogs,
 or your company.
 Do something for others.
 Or just meet your friends.
 Have some coffee together
 and share something.
Try that!
 When you do that,
you will feel happy.
 When you do social work
to help others,
 you might feel,
“That is who I am.
 That is me.”
 Why?
You have plenty of
 healthy sense of self.
 The unhealthy is only 10%.
 There are many
healthy things within you.
 Another experiment is
 to maybe try
to bring awareness
 to something.
 Maybe awareness
of your breath,
 breathing in,
breathing out.
 Or awareness of
 your body.
 You can scan your body
and just relax.
 Or awareness of sound.
 Practicing this awareness
 in connection with the pieces,
different factors,
 or what we sometimes call
 “skandhas,”
meaning different
 parts together —
 just connecting
with the pieces
 makes you feel happy.
 Why?
 Those different qualities,
 different pieces,
are who we are.
 These come together —
 we are not just one,
single, solid thing,
 but all of this.
 There are many
factors there.
 Sometimes
people ask me,
 “I practice
breathing meditation.
 Just by bringing awareness
to my breath,
 I feel happy. Why?”
 I ask scientists,
 and they do not know why.
 They say,
“Yes, we see the effect.
 Breathing meditation helps,
 but we do not know why.”
 According to
the meditative tradition,
 the reason why it benefits
 is because we are
connecting more
 with the healthy
sense of self.
 The awareness is connecting
with the pieces.
 The third experiment is
 to do something different.
 If you go to your office
 or workplace,
try to change your route.
 Maybe one day
choose one road,
 the next day another road.
 If it is not too far,
 one day you can walk,
 one day go by train,
 one day by bike.
 Try something different.
 If you do that,
you will feel happy.
 Why?
 Because of
 the permanence
that we are perceiving
 on the surface level,
 we do not want
to have surprises.
 But that is
on the surface level.
 At the deeper level,
 we understand
impermanence.
 We want to accept change,
 grow, and learn.
 There is a sense of
openness, flexibility,
 there at the deeper level.
 Even your
 favorite meal —
 if we eat the same meal
every day,
 soon we feel bored, right?
 Why?
 We love something new,
 something changing.
 That is “impermanence,”
everything changing.
 But that change
 is also connected
with interdependence,
 with something meaningful,
 kind,
 and compassionate.
 So many pieces are there,
 so there is multiplicity
 in our lives.
 And these pieces
 are connected to each other
 and interdependent.
 You and others
are also connected.
 The parts of your body, as well.
 The entire world
is connected.
 And these connections
are changing.
 This is “impermanence.”
 When they are changing
for the purpose
 of love, kindness,
compassion,
 then we feel really happy,
actually.
 You come home then.
 You are connecting
 to your deeper
sense of self.
 You can feel happy,
but not only that.
 You can make others happy,
as well.
 It is what we call
“a win-win situation.”
 You win, others win.
 That is the real meaning of
 a successful, meaningful,
 and beneficial life.
 So I will give you
homework today.
 The homework is to try
to do these experiments:
 Connect with awareness
 with some pieces —
 maybe the breath, sound,
 your body, something ―
 and just be with that.
 The second experiment is
 to try to do social work,
 help others.
 So connect
with interdependence
 through love
and compassion.
 Number three is
 to try to do
something different,
 something to grow,
something to learn,
 which is connected
with love, compassion,
 and awareness.
 With these together,
you change and grow.
 Try this.
 Maybe,
if you do this homework,
 write down in
 the comments what you did.
 You can share,
so we can all see.
 Thank you.
