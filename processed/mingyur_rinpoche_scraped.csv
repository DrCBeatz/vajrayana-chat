0,Mingyur Rinpoche   In Love with the World   YouTube.txt,Mingyur Rinpoche   In Love with the World   YouTube.txt.  [Music] you're listening to it conversation the video podcast of Banyan books and sound I'm your host foreign Israeli and I'm very honored to be here with minge Rinpoche he's a much loved meditation master in Tibetan Buddhist teacher an author of several books his latest book is called in love with the world which were counts his four years on a wandering retreat in India and Himalayas so wonderful to have you here and push a thank you thank you very much so I'd like to start off with asking the big question why you were a bit of a monastery in Bodhgaya I imagine it was a very comfortable familiar life and very esteemed role and he left it all I'm inspired and we have this tradition called wandering retreat so when I was young my mother used to read books about those great meditators in the Tibet the life story of those meditators and then I was born in Himalaya mountain in power so winter is quite cold and we all get together around fire and then my mother a book and up the student never my grandma will cry and I cry and we all cry so that really give me really kind of like great aspiration and then normally like mountains and nature so I did retreat for three years Richard and Indira to discuss about how to meditate you can meditate everywhere any times so I was this inspiration and it with me for a long time then and in 2011 I decided and I got the one related what was it about those stories that gave you the inspiration was there realizations that those wandering Yogi's had on retreat or was it the adventure of doing something completely different yeah so the main thing is about why we do this one routine is adding wood to the fire so first we will to practice meditation with kind of light right with the right circumstances and then if you go to the many different kind of light environment especially with the challenge with a lot of typical situation so we can hardest meditation with those typical circumstances so they really help us to improve our meditation and in your retreat what were some of the most difficult situations and circumstances that you face in my rigid so although I'm I've known meditation for since when I was nine years old and about the time I really want to do this one retreat and I prepare about going on the street but the most difficulty is when I leave my monastery I'm certainly out there alone so normally my life it's very comfortable everywhere I go there's a lot of people to care me and I never stay alone even one day so Sutton is a really big typical so almost like what I imagine it's kind of run naive so when you really come on the street there's a lot of things that I have to learn and a lot of things that emotional level physical level environment level a lot of difficult challenge did it in these difficult circumstances and unfamiliar situations did it sharpen and deepen your experience and practice of meditation yeah I think it really helps me I did I learned two things the first it really ain't hence my meditation so even though you face this typical situation at the beginning of ritual I almost died because of the food poison so very difficult but because of my meditation really helps I almost died but that was the one of the best experience in my life really helps second important thing is what I learned is I learned a lot of things about life and I have to go there alone and I have to survive everything by myself and I remember that when I went to the mountains and I have to make fire so to make fire take a few days to make fire in the end I was very happy oh now that's fire and what to do is I had to boil hot water and it took me two hours to boil one hot water after that what has a boil I was so happy and when I begin to dream tastes like smoke it was I was you know lowering the fire and then just producing a lot of smoke so should I learn a lot about the life tell us a little bit about the your near-death experience I mean that must have been a profound experience to be so close to death until it survived it was not like yes or the food after I have few thousand rupees at the beginning I had three thousand Indian rupees then all this money and finished within three weeks so then I was on the street so no money to buy food and then I went to one restaurant and beg the food they said oh you come in the night before they closed the restaurant so then I went there and they give me leftover food so that I think might be not I had that then that night African have diarrhea area and vomiting the next day continued so for five days I want to drink the the palm bill water so then that was a really kind of like difficult and then in the end I become paralyzed cannot see cannot hear and then what I did is I just practiced meditation so what we call the essence of meditation is to be with the awareness so although there's a lot of different experience there I feel like falling then losing the senses then become body become paralyzed by my mind to become clear when I were as small with this awareness mind become more clear more open in the end it's not not like hard not like the feeling that what we have the sensation the body thought with the image all this is a gone but - really fast completely open and I know what's going on but then there's no really words about what I'm experienced so beyond or knowledge beyond concept yet knows but I'm present so I'm in that state for a few hours and that is really giving me great insight about my meditation is that state the goal of meditation practice goal of meditation practice is to connect with that awareness which is always with us but it is not that to get rid of thought and emotion and feeling so but when we die it comes automatically by-product because of the time so we have this dying meditation so people meditators die with the meditation my father with my when my father died he was in the time meditation for three days my grandpa was a great meditator he was in that state for three and half days so when you are in the dime meditation your your body not suddenly become rotten and almost you look like normal Lulay smiling and face growing then up three days later the meditation finished as soon as amenities you finished the body become my ears and then change everything so on everything like that so my meditation is them when we die with this joyful non conceptual experience be with that state so that's the one we call dying meditation so that is not the particular goal of meditation when we practice in this life of course we have thought and emotion and feeling they say okay let's explore that a little bit further because that seems an easy route to take in context of our subject but all emotions all emotions how can one develop the ability to be in awareness even when very strong unpleasant emotions arise so what we call a ban this is like sky taught emotion feeling memory or this a light clock so no matter how much cloud in the sky or what kind of cloud it doesn't matter for the sky beautiful cloud ugly cloud stone or blue sky for the sky it doesn't matter so awareness is like sky all of it is present there and then thought emotion feeling the moon is a cloud comes and goes comes course so the meditation is to connect with the awareness not try to get it apart and feeling emotion so when we more makhani with awareness itself then we are not lost in the thought and emotion so to do do that the step-by-step Rajasthan begin with the word people breathing meditation so you aware of your breath so the breath is the object of your meditation breathing in everything else and there's there's a true type of meditation the object oriented or subject oriented the object oriented meditation meaning the breath is important stay with the breath and for us is the subject oriented the awareness is important so to maintain awareness spread it's just object so you learn this with the breath eventually you can watch your own feeling like stress sensation in your body the stress panic depression Semler you're watching the breath you can watch them and so normally what we call if you see the river you're out of River you don't have to stop the river so then you see panic when you see the feeling of stress that means there's space between you and stress yes in addition to emotions can you talk a little bit about self and the identity that we have that is part of our part of our personality and what how subject meditation may help us to break through that or break free of that yeah so there are three South so what we call unhealthy sense of self and healthy sense of self and then self beyond so there's three layers the first is unhealthy which is very sensitive easy to cry easy to laugh easy to froze is it to burn if someone says something slightly wrong you feel unhappy days someone say something nice and secondly episode as a really light very sensitive and delicate so that's the service level and below that there's healthy sense of self and that self is connected with the more open clear clarity what we call the sense of love compassion wisdom so unhealthy sense of self says you have to win an other applause at the healthy sense of self says we all are same kind and compassionate supported so you can experiment them whatever if you follow over to the hell unhealthy sense of self even you achieve a lot you will not really feel that the peace joy that comes inside you you still feel hollow but if you listen to healthy sense of self like do social walk help others really feel happy from inside so real you is more connected with that healthy sense of self and below them what we call the self beyond me or sometimes when people luminous self so that is the boundless free and that is the awareness like sky that always with us and there's a peaceful calm presence but we are not recognize that not so easy to recognize if we can talk a little bit more about the healthy sense itself how is that connected with free will so the healthy sense of self a actually is calling us all the time so no matter how much you achieve the deeper level there's still something more this is not the meaning of life what is this all about so this kind of genuine question is there so when you when you explore their question the really meaning of life is thing which is connected with love compassion something which is connected with care about you and others so that healthy sense of self is the real kind of life who you who we are actually and you know speaking on love and compassion you titled the book in love with the world a little bit about that title and what what your experience was in coming up with that to describe the book yeah at the beginning when I went to the on the strip Street I feel like why I'm here I'm not belong here I see the streets very dirty unsaved lot of dogs around me and in the daytime we are ok with the dogs and nighttime when I move little bit the old chased me and the scary so then I have this almost died experience then in the end I back I rest in Dublin and then I come back so when I come back everything's changed now now I feel like so happy to be alive the street become like my home and I remember this tree in from me and when I look at the tree while the tree is so alive so the leaves are shining and what I call that the tree become like tree is the made by love and wind blows to my face feelings so pleasant joy so much appreciation gratitude then after that for me in like unsaved the feeling of unsaved is I feel like everybody's like my home so normally what and then what I call is if you love the world Laura loves you back so it really helps the rest of my journey it really really become kind of like joyful because that that tends inside me and say and all these are gone once I free and I walk with it and free and all the sudden I find a lot of other opportunities lot of kind of like even though I know where I should go way to find food so a lot of things happen I put about that do you think that that's insight that's relevant to modern people that the experience of inside is reflected on the outside that somehow our inner and outer worlds are connected yeah so in Irak I really connect for me like when we think for example I have one friend and he was army before and he had the general which is quite a stir and he don't believe anybody eating you know everybody you know have to pick on Paul and have a lot of rooms in the army camp you cannot go after 7:00 p.m. then you have to do all this and people don't like him actually and they are breaking the rules and cheating him and few years later they changed the general and the new general is full of love and it just everybody who you're all of mature and of course we have these rules but you can see whether sometimes you know if you have some important you just go and you don't have to tell me even we all try our best and then it's flexible you know I believe you I trust you at the beginning all this I'm his friend they don't believe oh maybe it is a trap or something it's not real but it slowly sort of believed they all really like this new general and they support this new general and insulate the rules and the discipline everything become much better so it's become really productive everybody really support and they work together love each other so I think it's a really important how you your belief says the world for you I would like to speak a little bit about sleep and dreaming and the chapter that you wrote about how when we fall asleep there's a dissolution of senses and we're not even aware of what happens I mean other than remembering dreams can you just speak a little bit about about the importance of sleep and sleep meditation and and what that is of the purpose of it yeah so in the one before in the Bardo meditation so this book is about the death and dying my new book in love with the world so I use my own experience about almost die as the practice as part of that kind of light story in the book so normally bar do practice is like part of many in between or intermediate or in translation so in between this moment a really precious moment that if you know how to be with this moment and actually you can transform that whatever you want to transform it's more easy because normally we have this a lot of conceptual or fix mine so in the during this moment this fixed concept fix mine dies and we need to let die our cell if you don't die you can a rebirth so like break up lose the job second is something correcting habit or children 18 years old move away from home everything survive by yourself or what are things like that in our life help we are facing those things so these things are kind of a portal in between moment very important and another thing is going to sleep this is the moment of the dying and the having dream stage all these are also in between the stage so when we go to sleep actually we are dying we die our concept our memory our all this guy and then there's a disillusion experience if you feel like falling floating burn and then we feel a blown away in the end and then stir and then feel a little bit down and then feel almost unconscious and suddenly there's one second or half second very peaceful state of mind and if he be in that state whole sleep become meditation so that is what we call sleeping meditation but it very fast you're in a sleep we don't we don't feel it but when we're going to die we will have this experience for me I had a very clear experience stuff when I almost died falling floating oh there's a long clear so I thought mmm when I really die if I have like this you know I can meditate I'm so curious to hear you speak about just the value of under all the small ways that we must learn to die in our everyday lives and what what does it look like to let go and to die to our old perceptions or thoughts yep yep so first important is you need to accept the life is like wave of the ocean life is like stock market so what we call impermanence practice of impermanence changing up and down up and down the stock market go up and down so we make business right if the Stromer gets flat then you cannot have business so actually live go up and down is great we learn from up and down we grow from up and down so sometime what we called obstacle is the best opportunity when you look at the history all the great success ful persons they fail a lot at the beginning they learn from they didn't not give up so the thing is we have to accept that and continue to grow learn from obstacle learn from problem so what we call don't give up let it go let it go meaning accept the nature of reality and follow the flow of the nature by the same time about continued grow continue to learn so that's the part of how to practice the botto so when we are facing big problem actually that might be opening new door maybe we learn something great inside of them maybe that's the best opportunity what happened later in your life so whatever our fix believe the concept let go and then don't give up we all have great capacity we all have great talents we all are unique we have love compassion wisdom capacity so try your best and then that is really really I mean that for me great practice and and I become exciting I like to ask you about one of my favorite Zen quotes because I think it very much applies to your life and that is before enlightenment chop wood carry water after enlightenment chop wood carry water and you were in a role before you went on this retreat and you're in the role again what's changed yeah for me first when I when out there of course very challenge the beginning but the later is really really great insight and coming back I have to be prepared to face with the busy schedule teaching and I really like teaching because these meditation practices really change my life kind of like what now who who I am now is because of them this meditation practice so I really believe this thing I really would share this to others so I felt I feel normally kind of like sharing this to others this is kind of my job so when I come back I don't really feel big gap you know stay in the mountain alone I'm suddenly faced with other people uncomfortable or this I don't feel any particular tense but the one I remember then when I come back to my monastery and I want to open my and suddenly I saw six hands around my back because people like to help me you know they all want to help me that was quite otherwise I'm happy to be back also and lastly what is your aspiration for this book and you're teaching tour so I hope this book really benefit nowadays the world is really facing anxiety so when I finish my tea to say oh this is age of anxiety there's a lot of anxiety so the next problem is that we have this anxiety problem and the base of basis of this anxiety is death and I'm actually so when we try to ignore death and time the fear grows fear become even stronger but we can face it and we can learn from that and actually it really helps so I hope this benefit for kind of light know how to walk with the fear and eventually how to work with the get and I thank you so much it's been so wonderful to share time with you and listen about the experiences you had in the insights and also just to learn more about different practices that you teach thank you so much thank you very much you're most welcome [Music] 
1,Innate Well being with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche   YouTube.txt,"Innate Well being with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche   YouTube.txt.  . I want to tell you a short story. Many of you know about basic innate goodness, right? This has been translated from Tibetan. We have “deshek nyingpo,” “the enlightened essence.” “Kadak,” the “original purity.” “Buddha nature,” the essence of the Buddha. There are so many translations here, and if you want to make them all into one, then maybe we can translate it as before as “basic innate goodness.” But I found a new one. I just discovered it maybe 10 days ago: “innate well-being.” This is related to all the essence of all these different translations. The main thing is, as I think all of you know, that our fundamental nature is wholesome, complete, pure, beyond concept, beyond suffering, and beyond problems. Actually, we are not broken by nature, we are complete by nature. Especially nowadays, the language is very important. So I want to choose “innate well-being,” as it is quite easy for everybody to understand. As for the main meaning of this, sometimes I talk about how we might have 10 qualities, 1 negative and 9 positive. . . I have mentioned this many times. The 1 negative quality is only on the surface level. On the surface level, what we think is that there is singularity, which is self-centric. “Me,” number one. “I have to win, others have to lose. What about me?” It is ego-centric or self-centric. That is singularity. And that there is independence — we want to control. We do not want to care about others. And that there is permanence — we do not want to have unexpected surprises. It seems like we do not want to change. These three together are what we sometimes call “the unhealthy sense of self.” It is very unhealthy. It is not just unhealthy, but it causes a lot of suffering and pain, and it brings problems into your life, your social circle, your family, your company, your workplace. Everywhere there are big problems. Do you agree? So do you have that? If yes, raise your hand. Normally, most of us think, “Yes, I have plenty of those. Sounds familiar! 90% of who I am is those things.” But actually, it is just 10%. We have more wonderful things within us. Opposite to singularity, there is so much multiplicity, meaning that who we are has so many pieces, so many different qualities, so many different skills, knowledge, wisdom, capacity. We have many things there, but we are not aware of those pieces. We are not aware of those qualities. To connect with the pieces, bring awareness and you can connect with your own different parts of qualities, different skills, different potentials. These innate qualities are manifesting and radiating all the time. Second, independence. We want to have control, and we do not want to care about others. On the surface level, we think, “I have to win (singularity), and I do not care about others. Everything has to be in my hands.” Even if you follow that you may not be happy. Even if you become successful, you will automatically know “that is not who I am.” You feel something is missing. Maybe you can try to do some experimenting. Maybe do some social work. Get out there. Even help your family members, your pets, cats and dogs, or your company. Do something for others. Or just meet your friends. Have some coffee together and share something. Try that! When you do that, you will feel happy. When you do social work to help others, you might feel, “That is who I am. That is me.” Why? You have plenty of healthy sense of self. The unhealthy is only 10%. There are many healthy things within you. Another experiment is to maybe try to bring awareness to something. Maybe awareness of your breath, breathing in, breathing out. Or awareness of your body. You can scan your body and just relax. Or awareness of sound. Practicing this awareness in connection with the pieces, different factors, or what we sometimes call “skandhas,” meaning different parts together — just connecting with the pieces makes you feel happy. Why? Those different qualities, different pieces, are who we are. These come together — we are not just one, single, solid thing, but all of this. There are many factors there. Sometimes people ask me, “I practice breathing meditation. Just by bringing awareness to my breath, I feel happy. Why?” I ask scientists, and they do not know why. They say, “Yes, we see the effect. Breathing meditation helps, but we do not know why.” According to the meditative tradition, the reason why it benefits is because we are connecting more with the healthy sense of self. The awareness is connecting with the pieces. The third experiment is to do something different. If you go to your office or workplace, try to change your route. Maybe one day choose one road, the next day another road. If it is not too far, one day you can walk, one day go by train, one day by bike. Try something different. If you do that, you will feel happy. Why? Because of the permanence that we are perceiving on the surface level, we do not want to have surprises. But that is on the surface level. At the deeper level, we understand impermanence. We want to accept change, grow, and learn. There is a sense of openness, flexibility, there at the deeper level. Even your favorite meal — if we eat the same meal every day, soon we feel bored, right? Why? We love something new, something changing. That is “impermanence,” everything changing. But that change is also connected with interdependence, with something meaningful, kind, and compassionate. So many pieces are there, so there is multiplicity in our lives. And these pieces are connected to each other and interdependent. You and others are also connected. The parts of your body, as well. The entire world is connected. And these connections are changing. This is “impermanence.” When they are changing for the purpose of love, kindness, compassion, then we feel really happy, actually. You come home then. You are connecting to your deeper sense of self. You can feel happy, but not only that. You can make others happy, as well. It is what we call “a win-win situation.” You win, others win. That is the real meaning of a successful, meaningful, and beneficial life. So I will give you homework today. The homework is to try to do these experiments: Connect with awareness with some pieces — maybe the breath, sound, your body, something ― and just be with that. The second experiment is to try to do social work, help others. So connect with interdependence through love and compassion. Number three is to try to do something different, something to grow, something to learn, which is connected with love, compassion, and awareness. With these together, you change and grow. Try this. Maybe, if you do this homework, write down in the comments what you did. You can share, so we can all see. Thank you. "
2,Three Lifelong Skills with Meditation by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche   YouTube.txt,"Three Lifelong Skills with Meditation by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche   YouTube.txt.  . Three Lifelong Skills with Meditation Normally, when we learn meditation we are not only learning how to be with the breath or sounds or whatever meditation object, but at the same time the most important thing, which is something very important for our life — what I sometimes call “three lifelong skills.” What are these three lifelong skills? For example, maybe I will ask you a question. Let’s say. . . do not think about pizza. Try not to think about pizza now. Are you thinking about pizza? If you think about pizza. . . I told you not to think about pizza, so if you do, this is a big problem. Now I know you are thinking about pizza. That is what we call “aversion” or “resentment.” Or sometimes it may transform into hatred or anger. As long as you try to push something away, what happens? That object or that phenomenon becomes kind of unpleasant, unlovable, noisy, louder, disturbing. It does not matter what kind of object. It does not matter. Normally we think of the best, but suddenly somehow if you have resentment, it becomes unpleasant. So that manifests within our relationships with our partners and colleagues at our workplace, and it also manifests in the environment, at your job, in your studies. Sometimes we say “we make our own enemies by ourselves.” Since we make them, we can free ourselves. It is in our hands. Okay, that is the first problem. The second problem. How many of you really want to go to sleep at night — “I need sleep, I need sleep” — and what happens? Sleep runs away. You become more awake and alert, rolling to the right side, rolling to the left side. “I need sleep,” and sleep disappears. If so, raise your hand. Or maybe, “It is too late. I want to sleep, I do not want to touch my smartphone.” But you pick it up. That may also happen. That is what we call “craving.” When we have a strong craving, we become out of control. Then we become a slave to that phenomenon, situation, object, person, or whatever. That is the second problem. The third problem, the big problem, is that we do not see things very clearly. We do not know reality very clearly. How can we see things clearly? The first important thing is that we need to learn to be with it “as it is.” We have to accept whatever it is — we do not need to change too much, add things, or get rid of things. The 1st thing is to just see the situation, thing, phenomenon, object, or whatever as it is. If we do not do that, it is “ignorance.” So the third problem is not seeing things as they are. We are prejudging. We have preconceptions, sometimes related with childhood experiences, trauma — so many things there. We cannot really get rid of them, but what we can do is just see things as they are. Then wisdom develops. Now, what are the three lifelong skills? The first skill is wisdom — seeing things as they are. The second skill is what I call “learning to be okay with not okay.” So we need to learn acceptance, openness, flexibility, forgiveness, kindness, compassion, all these things. The last, the third skill, is to not be lost, but to be present. How can we do that? Once you already have a habit, it is difficult to become free of it. Whatever you do aids or becomes a support for your problem. When I was young, I had panic attacks. But for me the biggest problem was panic of panic. So once you are in that trap it is difficult to become free. But there is another way. Another way is through meditation. First we choose a neutral object — maybe your breath, sound, a visual object, a stone, a flower, or something else. Anything can be used as support — a table, the sky, water, or anything that we need to be with. We say the essence of meditation is awareness. Awareness means that you know what you are thinking, feeling, doing. . . Can you see my hand? That is awareness, and that becomes meditation now. Do you believe it? At the beginning I did not believe it, but now I do. When I was first learning, my father told me something like that. I thought it was too easy, but actually that is all. When you look at my hand, your eyes look at my hand and also, at the same time, your mind looks at my hand. When your eyes and mind are both together with my hand, that becomes meditation. We will do this today with breathing meditation. We can practice this together. First of all, I would like to ask you a question. How many of you are breathing right now? If you are breathing right now, raise your hand. I hope that while you are watching this video or hearing this audio, you are raising your hand. That means you are breathing, right? Of course, you might think, “Ha! Stupid question! Of course I am breathing, I am alive!” That is all! That is now breathing meditation. You have learned it. Why does that become meditation? Because when I asked you, “Are you breathing now?” in that moment your mind was with the breath. When the breath and mind are together it becomes breathing meditation. Let’s try this together. Please, again, keep your spine loosely straight. If you want, you can close your eyes. Relax your body, relax the muscles in your body. Feel the tactile sensation between your body and the chair, cushion, or whatever you are sitting on. And feel the room temperature — a warm, cold, or perfect temperature, or whatever. Now, be aware of your breath. Breathing in, breathing out. And it is natural breathing now. You do not need to control your breath. Shallow breathing is ok, deep breathing is okay, irregular breathing is okay, tight breathing is okay, relaxed breathing is okay. . . Just natural breathing. While your mind is being with the breath, so much “blah, blah, yada, yada” will come. “What shall I do tomorrow?” “Oops, I forgot something.” “Oh, my to-do list.” “Oh, the pizza is coming.” Whatever those thoughts are, let them come. As long as you do not forget the breath, anything can come up. Again we completely forget the breath. No problem. Remember again. Remember for glimpses of the breath. So, now you have already learned the three lifelong skills with breathing meditation. Natural breath, being with the breath as it is, is the beginning of developing wisdom. All the “blah, blah, yada, yada” — — all the mistakes, problems, worries, to-do lists — let them come. There is no need to stop them. Remember, if you say, “Do not think,” you will think more. Now let them come, let them go. That is skill number two. Skill number three. You are not completely lost. You are being with the breath again — what we call “short times, many times.” These three skills you can apply in your workplace. Whatever you do, your work, be there with clarity, be present with it. When you are with it as it is then you begin to see the situation clearly. But at the same time, everywhere there are problems and mistakes. That is normal! We can learn and grow from problems. Normally, problems are okay. Problems, obstacles, and all this help us to grow and learn. Let them come, let them go, but do not get lost completely. You always come back to your work, studies, or connection with others. You can apply this to relationships, and they will become more open, more genuine, and more harmonious. And your studies, also. If your mind is tight, or if you give up, you cannot study well.

He has written five books and oversees the Tergar Meditation Community, an international network of Buddhist meditation centers. Life[edit] Mingyur Rinpoche was born in Nepal in 1975[1] the youngest of four brothers. His mother is Sönam Chödrön, a descendant of the two Tibetan kings Songtsen Gampo and Trisong Deutsen. His brothers are Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche, Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, and Tsoknyi Rinpoche and his nephews are Phakchok Rinpoche and the reincarnation of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, known popularly as Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche. From the age of nine,[1] his father, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche,[1] taught him meditation,[1] passing on to him the most essential instructions of the Dzogchen and Mahamudra traditions. At the age of eleven, Mingyur Rinpoche began studies at Sherab Ling Monastery[1] in northern India, the seat of Tai Situ Rinpoche. Two years later, Mingyur Rinpoche began a traditional three-year retreat at Sherab Ling.[1] At the age of nineteen, he enrolled at Dzongsar Institute, where, under the tutelage of the renowned Khenpo Kunga Wangchuk, he studied the primary topics of the Buddhist academic tradition, including Middle Way philosophy and Buddhist logic. At age twenty, Mingyur Rinpoche became the functioning abbot of Sherab Ling.[1] At twenty-three, he received full monastic ordination.[1] During this time, Mingyur Rinpoche received important Dzogchen transmissions from Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche.[1] In 2007, Mingyur Rinpoche completed the construction of Tergar Monastery in Bodhgaya, India, which will serve large numbers of people attending Buddhist events at this sacred pilgrimage site, serve as an annual site for month-long Karma Kagyu scholastic debates, and serve as an international study institute for the Sangha and laity. The institute will also have a medical clinic for local people.[2] Mingyur Rinpoche has overseen the Kathmandu Tergar Osel Ling Monastery, founded by his father, since 2010. He also opened a shedra (monastic college) at the monastery.[3] In June 2011, Mingyur Rinpoche left his monastery in Bodhgaya to begin a period of extended retreat. Rinpoche left in the middle of the night, taking nothing with him, but leaving a farewell letter.[4] He spent four years as a wandering yogi.[5][6] During the first few weeks of this retreat, Rinpoche had a near-death experience, likely due to a severe form of botulism. This may have been the result of choosing to eat only the meals that were free and available to him after allowing himself to run out of money. The near-death experience, according to Rinpoche, was one of the most pivotal and transformative experiences of his life. After continuing with his retreat for four years, he later returned to his position as abbot.[5][6] Books[edit] The Joy of Living: Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness ISBN 0-307-34625-0, Harmony Books (with Eric Swanson) Joyful Wisdom: Embracing Change and Finding Freedom ISBN 978-0-307-40779-5, Harmony Books (with Eric Swanson) Ziji: The Puppy Who Learned to Meditate ISBN 978-0-95638580-2 (with Torey Hayden and Charity Larrison) Turning Confusion into Clarity: A Guide to the Foundation Practices of Tibetan Buddhism ISBN 978-1-61180-121-7, Shambhala Publications under its Snow Lion imprint.
